as I said in an earlier reply, my preference would also be to keep it
very strict and simple; although my preference is to stick to hex.
My suggestion was 0x%x format, always with the leading 0x, always lower
case, allowing but not requiring 0 padding, and never more than 18
characters (including the 0x). Always using the string format.
