This is exactly how HMP commands should work.

By moving them to qmp-shell, we get to code them in qmp-shell's language
(Python, I guess) rather than C.

I think we need to decide what qmp-shell's mission should be: is it a
better socat for the QMP monitor, or a replacement for the traditional
HMP monitor?

You may answer "both".  It'll complicate things, though.  More on that
below.

As long as we develop qmp-shell and QMP together, we don't *have* to
separate name spaces.  It could simply be "info block".

However, consider chardev-add.  Example from char.json:

    -> { "execute" : "chardev-add",
         "arguments" : { "id" : "baz",
                         "backend" : { "type" : "pty", "data" : {} } } }
    <- { "return": { "pty" : "/dev/pty/42" } }

Here's the HMP equivalent:

    (qemu) chardev-add pty,id=3Dbaz
    char device redirected to /dev/pts/16 (label baz)

With your proposed "?" prefix, the straightforward way to run
chardev-add gives your the (thankfully non-giant) textwall of gibberish.
If you stick in a "?" and change the "-" to "_", you get the
pretty-printed version.  Not exactly the kind of UX we strive for, I'm
afraid, even if we fix the '-' vs. '_' nonsense.

If qmp-shell aims to be a better socat for the QMP monitor, then "?info
block" is out of scope, and so is pretty-printed chardev-add.

If qmp-shell aims to replace HMP, then query-block is out of scope, and
so is JSON-printing chardev-add.  Also, "qmp-shell" is a misnomer.

If qmp-shell aims to do both, we need to try harder :)

Kevin mentioned another way to provide HMP-like functionality in
qmp-shell: "have a QMP mode and an HMP mode and the user can switch
between these modes."

To actually replace HMP, we'll want such commands.

Everybody knows enterprise deployments always work, and always perform
perfectly.  Commands for debugging and monitoring them are quite
superfluous ;-P
