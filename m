I noticed this as well. Apparently it was introduced in the following
commit:

https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/ebe15582cafeb944a1c6e99aa526e81a1551c567

Saying:

---
pc: Add an SMB0 ACPI device to q35

This is so I2C devices can be found in the ACPI namespace.  Currently
that's only IPMI, but devices can be easily added now.

Adding the devices required some PCI information, and the bus itself
to be added to the PCMachineState structure.

Note that this only works on Q35, the ACPI for PIIX4 is not capable
of handling an SMBus device.

Title:
  SB.PCI0.SMB0 device drivers unavailable

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  QEMU 4.2 introduces new device with this code:

  static void build_smb0(Aml *table, I2CBus *smbus, int devnr, int func)
  {
      Aml *scope =3D aml_scope("_SB.PCI0");
      Aml *dev =3D aml_device("SMB0");

      aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_HID", aml_eisaid("APP0005")));
      aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_ADR", aml_int(devnr << 16 | func)));
      build_acpi_ipmi_devices(dev, BUS(smbus), "\\_SB.PCI0.SMB0");
      aml_append(scope, dev);
      aml_append(table, scope);
  }

  It is detected by Windows 10 as 'Unknown Device' and there is no driver a=
vailable.
  Please provide a working Windows driver or give ability to disable this d=
evice.
