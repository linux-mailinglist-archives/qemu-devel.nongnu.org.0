Yup.  BoF minutes: "The one way to get people read log files is crashing
their application."

You're right in that relying on *humans* to read the machine-readable
deprecation notice probaly won't work for old client code trying to use
newly deprecated QMP.  It should work for new client code trying to use
already deprecated QMP.

Yes.

However, ensuring tests fail whenever libvirt receives a deprecation
notice via QMP seems harder than having them pass --future to QEMU to
make it crash instead of sending such a notice.

Let's assume all libvirt ever does with deprecation notices is logging
them.  Would that solve the problem of reliably alerting libvirt
developers to deprecation issues?  Nope.  But it could help
occasionally.
