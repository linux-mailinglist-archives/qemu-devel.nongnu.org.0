I've created a new patches for getdents bug
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D23960 and I can't
reproduce python permissions issue anymore. My mips image built with
qemu user works perfect.

Title:
  Please refactor linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello. I am working with qemu on test images. I've added a new syscall
  (436) to qemu but received ENOSYS from mips application.

  Please open "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c". I've added at the end of
  "mips_syscall_args" the following:

  ```
  MIPS_SYS(sys_getdents64_x32, 3)
  ```

  But

  ```
  syscall_num =3D env->active_tc.gpr[2] - 4000;
  if (syscall_num >=3D sizeof(mips_syscall_args)) {
    ret =3D -TARGET_ENOSYS;
  ```

  returns -TARGET_ENOSYS

  We can see that "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c" differs a lot from
  "linux-user/arm/cpu_loop.c". Arm has it's own "ARM_NR_BASE" and etc.

  Can you please refactor mips cpu loop in the same way as arm? Thank
  you.
