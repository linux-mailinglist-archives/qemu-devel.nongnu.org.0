I thought we had very few places that set realized=3Dtrue directly,
so changing this behavior would be easy.

I was mistaken.  Grepping for 'set_bool.*"realized"' found more
than 300 matches.

We could introduce a "plugged" property which implicitly calls
the hotplug handler, and run a global s/"realized"/"plugged"/
substitution in the whole tree.  Would it be worth the trouble,
though?
