I don't feel particularly badly about the decision to squash it in
during the stop-and-copy phase; for devices where the pinned memory
is large, I don't think doing it during the main phase makes much sense;
especially if you then have to deal with tracking changes in pinning.

Having said that, I agree with marking it as experimental, because
I'm dubious how useful it will be for the same reason, I worry
about whether the downtime will be so large to make it pointless.
