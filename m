Please note that "hot-pluggable" is *not* required for "need unrealize()
to work", at least in theory.  Cold plug exists, and cold unplug could
exist.

Commit 1a37eca107, six years ago:

    qdev: add "hotpluggable" property to Device
   =20
    Currently it's possible to make PCIDevice not hotpluggable
    by using no_hotplug field of PCIDeviceClass. However it
    limits this only to PCI devices and prevents from
    generalizing hotplug code.
   =20
    So add similar field to DeviceClass so it could be reused
    with other Devices and would allow to replace PCI specific
    hotplug callbacks with generic implementation. Following
    patches will replace PCIDeviceClass.no_hotplug with this
    new property.
   =20
    In addition expose field as "hotpluggable" readonly property,
    to make it possible to read its value via QOM interface.
   =20
    Make DeviceClass hotpluggable by default as it was assumed
    before.

A device's "hot-pluggability" comes into play only when both bus and
machine support hot-plug.  And before we even get there, the device
needs to be "pluggable", i.e. dc->user_creatable.

Bus types supporting hot plug include PCI, SCSI, USB, virtio-serial-bus.
Grep for qbus_set_hotplug_handler().
