So you mean in init_iova_domain()?

I see the BUG_ON was introduced in
0fb5fe874c42942e16c450ae05da453e13a1c09e "iommu: Make IOVA domain page
size explicit" but was it meant to remain?

Logically when we allocate buffer IOVAs for DMA accesses, later on,
shouldn't it be possible to use the actual granule set on init() and
make sure the allocated size is properly aligned.

Reading the commit msg it explicitly says that "the systems may contain
heterogeneous IOMMUs supporting differing minimum page sizes, which may
also not be common with the CPU page size".

Thanks

Eric
