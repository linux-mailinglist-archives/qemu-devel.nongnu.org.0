Should we invert the default NOCACHE value?

See commits c1958e9d & 6fe3ae3f:

    docker: Improved image checksum

    When a base image locally defined by QEMU, such as in the debian images,
    is updated, the dockerfile checksum mechanism in docker.py still skips
    updating the derived image, because it only looks at the literal content
    of the dockerfile, without considering changes to the base image.

    For example we have a recent fix e58c1f9b35e81 that fixed
    debian-win64-cross by updating its base image, debian8-mxe, but due to
    above "feature" of docker.py the image in question is automatically NOT
    rebuilt unless you add NOCACHE=1. It is noticed on Shippable:

    https://app.shippable.com/github/qemu/qemu/runs/541/2/console

    because after the fix is merged, the error still occurs, and the log
    shows the container image is, as explained above, not updated.

    This is because at the time docker.py was written, there wasn't any
    dependencies between QEMU's docker images.

    Now improve this to preprocess any "FROM qemu:*" directives in the
    dockerfiles while doing checksum, and inline the base image's dockerfile
    content, recursively. This ensures any changes on the depended _QEMU_
    images are taken into account.

    This means for external images that we expect to retrieve from docker
    registries, we still do it as before. It is not perfect, because
    registry images can get updated too. Technically we could substitute the
    image name with its hex ID as obtained with $(docker images $IMAGE
    --format="{{.Id}}"), but --format is not supported by RHEL 7, so leave
    it for now.

    docker: docker.py make --no-cache skip checksum test

    If you invoke with NOCACHE=1 we pass --no-cache in the argv to
    docker.py but may still not force a rebuild if the dockerfile checksum
    hasn't changed. By testing for its presence we can force builds
    without having to manually remove the docker image.
