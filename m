Assuming you mean the hardware, yes, the kernel for it is configured
with the powernv_defconfig.

Assuming that you mean how I call qemu, yes, also powernv: my full
command is:

qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu power9 -M powernv -m 4G -s -S \
-chardev socket,id=qemu-monitor,host=localhost,port=7777,server,nowait,telnet \
-mon qemu-monitor,mode=readline -nographic -bios build/cbfs/fallback/bootblock.bin

If I pass it the full coreboot.rom file via
`-drive file=./build/coreboot.rom,format=raw,if=mtd` it returns this error:
'qemu-system-ppc64: Initialization of device pnv-pnor failed: bad header'
which arises in hw/ppc/pnv_pnor.c:136-140 using legoater's powernv-4.2
branch.

Ah, so I wasn't going crazy and it was skipping the first four instructions,
how odd. Any particular reason the first four instruction are skipped?
On hostboot that's setting up the msr; on skiboot that seems to be the
fdt_entry branch to boot_entry.

Basically not have to have a pnor-style image for mtd devices, and not
immidiatly jump to skiboot.
