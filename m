I'd rather not do that. AArch64 KVM doesn't support CPU models, so we
shouldn't try to fake it by allowing '-cpu cortex-a72' to work, even when
using it on a host with Cortex-A72 CPUs. I'd rather all AArch64 KVM users
use 'host' or 'max' (which is the same as 'host' when used with KVM) until
CPU models truly work.

The A57 and A53 KVM targets would have to be exactly the same as the
KVM generic target in order to do that. And, even then we can't remove
them from KVM, as they're API, so it doesn't help much to change them
in QEMU.

I don't have a strong preference here, but if the naming is what's
troublesome, then I'd think we're better off creating something like
an aarch64_aXX_initfn() function and then calling it from both a57
and max, and anywhere else it fits.
