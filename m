Hi everyone,

My name is Alex, I=E2=80=99m a student at the University of Michigan and I =
just
completed an internship at IBM Research. There, I have been working on a
project very related to this topic. I tested using Cloud Hypervisor=E2=80=
=99s
Rust-based vhost-user virtiofs and block devices with QEMU. Bigger picture,
I wanted to explore the implications of using Rust for vhost-user devices
in QEMU.



I agree with the points from the original post, namely:

=C2=B7      C programming bugs are responsible for a large number of CVEs, =
and
specifically CVEs coming from the implementations of virtual devices.

=C2=B7      As a programming language, Rust has matured to a point where it=
 is
worth considering it more seriously for production use. It has extensive
libraries and community support. Many big players in the industry are
already using Rust for production workloads.



Full Transparency: the Drawbacks:

It would be deceptive to only showcase Rust in an ideal light.

=C2=B7      The benchmarks I ran show a noticeable performance hit from
switching to a RustVMM implementation of a virtiofsd device.

=C2=B7      While Rust has matured greatly, it still is missing a bit. One
example of this that came up was that the rust compiler does not have
Control Flow Integrity (CFI) features. While these are not as important as
in =E2=80=9Cunsafe=E2=80=9D languages such as C, the ability to express uns=
afe portions of
code does allow for some types of memory bugs =E2=80=93 although to a much =
lesser
extent (an interesting case of this surfaced from Firecracker, and the
handling of mmio [1]). So further protections such as Control Flow
Integrity can still be desirable, even with rust code.

=C2=B7      There have been years of optimization work put into the C
implementations of these devices, and it=E2=80=99s hard to evaluate how opt=
imized
the relatively novel rust implementations are.

A piece of exciting news is that many of these drawbacks show a pathway for
future improvement. Improvements to rust infrastructure are very realistic.
Rust boils down to LLVM just like C, so porting over C=E2=80=99s CFI featur=
es
should be feasible. If more development resources are put into the RustVMM
project, there is no reason their implementations can=E2=80=99t be as optim=
ized as
the C versions, and this could be greatly aided by expertise coming from
the QEMU communities familiarity with these topics.



I believe vhost-user devices are an excellent place to start since It
lowers the entry barrier for developing in Rust. The device only has to
interface with the C-based QEMU binary through a standardized protocol. It
removes many worries of moving entirely away from C, since adding a set of
Rust devices would simply be giving more options and room to explore.



I am putting together the scripts I used for all of the tests at this repo:

https://github.com/Alex-Carter01/Qemu-Rust-Testing

I am working to standardize everything to make it easier to replicate. I
would love any community involvement if people wanted to see how results
differ based on the hardware setup, build configuration of the devices etc.

The repo also has links to a recording of my original presentation and the
slides I was using if you would like to look at that format or see the
discussion which came out of it.
