Look, a rabbit hole :)

I got rough patches, with several more to do.

There's one thing worth mentioning.  Unrealize is recursive: unrealizing
a qdev recurses into its qbuses, and unrealizing a qbus recurses into
its qdevs.  Realize, however, is TODO recursive :)  See your commit
5942a19040 "qdev: recursively unrealize devices when unrealizing bus",
2014-06-19.

Moving "put on qbus" from qdev_create() (and its wrappers) to
qdev_init_nofail() means we put on bus by realizing.  No use to
recursive realization then,

I wield a sharp hatchet.
