Fixed by this patch.

Doing this for reopen state is fine.

This one looks kind of questionable. It basically builds its
BlockDriveState manually without using any of the block layer open
functions.

Harmless as Eiichi explained below, but not nice either.

I think it should still be changed just because it would make the code
cleaner. It's always better to use common infrastructure than
reimplementing it locally.
