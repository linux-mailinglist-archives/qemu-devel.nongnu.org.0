All the devices in QEMU form a tree, as reported by "info qtree".
So, IIUC, the challenge is to provide a way to uniquely identify
any node in the tree.

Devices configured by the user/mgmt app will have an "id" property
but most built-in devices will not have any "id". In addition even
user configured devices may create multiple sub-nodes in the tree
without "id" parameters.

Uniquely referencing nodes in a tee is a solved problem though,
even without "id" parameters. The XPath query languages shows
this for XML.

-global defines a query language based on the object type, and
property name which is insufficiently flexible

-set defines a query language based on the object type and ID
value and property name(s) which is again insufficiently flexible.


We "merely" need a new query language targetted to QEMU's qtree
structure, which we can expose in the CLI that gives unique access
to every possible property.

Here is the truncated 'info qtree' for a running guest of mine:

    gpio-in "" 24

        bar 0: i/o at 0xc100 [0xc11f]
        bus: virtio-bus
          type virtio-pci-bus
          dev: virtio-balloon-device, id ""
            deflate-on-oom =3D false
            free-page-hint =3D false
            qemu-4-0-config-size =3D false
            iothread =3D ""
            indirect_desc =3D true
            event_idx =3D true
            notify_on_empty =3D true
            any_layout =3D true
            iommu_platform =3D false
            use-started =3D false


Consider the problem is to set the "deflate-on-oom" property on
the balloon device.

To uniquely identify this we can have a string:

 /dev[1]/bus[pci/0]/dev[id=3Dballoon0]/bus[virtio-bus]/dev[0]/deflate-on-oo=
m=3Dtrue

If we consider that "id" values are unique, we can allow a simplication
by omitting everything before that part of the match - "//" could indicate
an omitted part like XPath allows, so we'd get

 //dev[id=3Dballoon0]/bus[virtio-bus]/dev[0]/deflate-on-oom=3Dtrue

There's only one bus, and one dev on that bus, so knowing this we can
simplify a bit more and still be a unique query, to get this:

 //dev[id=3Dballoon0]/bus/dev/deflate-on-oom=3Dtrue

Or even allow use of "//" in the middle too:

 //dev[id=3Dballoon0]//deflate-on-oom=3Dtrue

Which conceptually says

   "find the device with id balloon0 and set the property 'deflate-on-oom'
   on the first child node in the qtree that hsa such a property name"

I didn't say this would be pretty, and of course no one would seriously
use this syntax for the virtio-balloon device, as you'd just set the
property with -device. It should work for the many built-in devices
though.

Now just provide a new CLI arg

 $QEMU -qtree //dev[id=3Dballoon0]//deflate-on-oom=3Dtrue

Daniel
