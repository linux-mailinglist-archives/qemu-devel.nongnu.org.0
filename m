In case anyone is interested at:

https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commits/cxl-v7-draft-for-test
is a draft of what will be v7 with basic CXL switch support
and the issue that Ben pointed out in patch 17 fixed.
No change to anything before patch 17 so does not affect the proposed
first block of patches to apply (i.e. no need to wait for v7 if
it makes sense to pick those up sooner!)

There was some follow through from the fix in the later qtests
as they now correctly require LSA / Label Storage Areas to be provided
for CXL-mem types. I've also moved the initial type 3 test later in
the series so that lsa parameter is required by the time it is introduced.
The LSA requirement may be relaxed in the future when volatile memory
support is added as then an LSA becomes optional.

The switch support includes interleave decoding for one layer of switches
and at least for basic tests it all seems to work.  Note that with
current kernel proposal you'll need 2 ports on a host bridge (one can
have nothing attached to it) so as to ensure the kernel programs the HDM decoders.
I'll see if I can find an elegant solution on the kernel side for this
as single port HB with HDM decoders is allowed by the CXL spec.

Next up is fleshing out sanity checks / write masks etc for various interfaces
so that the emulation will reject invalid writes etc much as real
hardware would be expected to do.

Thanks,

Jonathan
