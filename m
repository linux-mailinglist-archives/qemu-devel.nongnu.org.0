If it doesn't matter, the best value would be buf_align = 1.

Here, we actually do need alignment, but it's unknown whether it would
be 512 or 4096 or something entirely. Failing to align requests
correctly results in I/O errors.

This is like buf_align for XFS: We don't know the right value, but
getting it wrong causes I/O errors.

This suggests that byte-aligned requests are fine for NFS, i.e.
buf_align = request_alignment = 1 would be optimal in this case.

This makes sense in general.

What the commit message doesn't explain, but probably should do is how
we determine whether we could successfully detect request alignment. The
approach taken here is that a detected alignment of 1 is understood as
failure to detect the real alignment.

With cases 2 and 3 this gives the desird result; however for cases 1 and
4, an alignment of 1 would be the actual correct value, and the new
probing algorithm results in a worse result.

However, since the negative effect of the old algorithm in cases 2 and 3
is I/O errors whereas the effect of the new one in cases 1 and 4 is just
degraded performance for I/O that isn't 4k aligned, the new approch is
still preferable.

I think we need to make this tradeoff clearer in the commit message and
the comment in the code, but the approach is reasonable enough.

Nested ternary operators over five lines aren't that readable any more.
I'd suggest using at least one more if:

    if (align != 1) {
        s->buf_align = align;
    } else {
        s->buf_slign = bs->bl.request_alignment ?: max_align;
    }

In fact, is checking bs->bl.request_alignment for 0 even worth it here?
If it's 0, we failed to find any working configuration and will return
an error anyway. Then it doesn't matter if s->buf_align becomes 0, too.
