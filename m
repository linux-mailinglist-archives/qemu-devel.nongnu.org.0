Currently, a and b will be both enabled or disabled.  For example, a and b are
in relationship a->b, which means b is dependent on a.  If -cpu host,a=off,b=on,
then both a and b are enabled.  If -cpu host,b=on,a=off, then both a and b are
disabled.  Maybe we should report an error to user in this scenario?

Thanks,
