Thanks, I'm doing that now.

It doesn't discard it, but it compares it to the reference output and
prints a diff if it's non-empty.

At least for bash scripts, stderr contains important test output. Not
sure what the *_log() functions in iotests.py do, maybe they redirect
the stderr output from tools to stdout.

We can still take these patches for a later pull request if you think we
should, though I'm not sure if they are useful given how things actually
work. I don't have a strong opinion either way (except that I don't want
to see more than a single line per test without -d, but these patches
don't try to do this even though you wrote them under the assumption
that this is how things work).
