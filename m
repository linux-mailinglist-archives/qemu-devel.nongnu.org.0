It's irritating that this 3 insn sequence is already a thing, baked into other
sim/emulators.  Seems to me that it would have been easier to abscond with

    ebreak + func3 field != 0.

For semi-hosting, it seems even better if the semi-hosting syscall instruction
is not "real", because you're explicitly requesting services from "unreal"
hardware.  It should be specified to generate a SIGILL type of exception
anywhere semi-hosting is not enabled.

That said, it is possible to do this in the translator, by considering this
sequence to be one 12-byte instruction.

You'd build in a recognizer into the decoder such that, when semi-hosting is
enabled, seeing the entry nop starts looking ahead:

  - If this is not the first insn in the TB, and there are
    not 8 more bytes remaining on the page, terminate the
    current TB.  This will re-start the machine in the next TB.

  - If the complete sequence is not found, then advance the pc
    past the entry nop and let nature take its course wrt the
    subsequent instructions.

  - If the sequence crosses a page, then so be it.  Because of
    step 1, this only happens when we *must* cross a page, and
    will have recognized any paging exception anyway.
    The generic parts of qemu will handle proper invalidation of
    a TB that crosses a page boundary.

  - This is kinda similar to the target/sh4 code to handle
    generic user-space atomic sequences: c.f. decode_gusa().

  - This implementation does mean that you can't jump directly
    to the ebreak insn and have the sequence be recognized.
    Control must flow through the entry nop.
    This is a bug or a feature depending on the reviewer.  ;-)

With that in mind, it may be simpler to handle all of this not in the
translator, but in the function that delivers the ebreak exception.  At that
point one can arrange to read memory without raising additional exceptions.
