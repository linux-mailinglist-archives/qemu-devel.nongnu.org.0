No, fields can be smaller if that makes sense; but I still think it's=20
important that fields don't straddle natural alignment boundaries. When=20
adding just one field at a time, it's easier to add a wide field and=20
less padding than a narrow field and lots of padding, if we're still=20
striving for alignment.

>>> 2. What is the benefit of padding, which you propose?

The biggest benefit to keeping large fields from straddling alignment=20
boundaries is that you can mmap() a qcow2 file and do naturally-aligned=20
reads of those large fields, rather than byte-by-byte reads, without=20
risking SIGBUS on some architectures.  (You still have to worry about=20
endianness, but that's true regardless of alignment)

Huh?  104 =3D=3D 8 * 13, so our current v3 header size is 8-byte aligned.=
=20
Likewise for 72 =3D=3D 8 * 9 for v2 header size.

?

No. I think it is just clarifying what was implicitly already  the case.=20
  Remember, immediately after the header comes header extensions, and=20
THOSE are explicitly required to be multiple-of-8 in size.  That=20
requirement makes no sense unless the header itself ends on an 8-byte=20
alignment (which it does for all existing v2 and v3 images prior to our=20
first official v3 header extension).
