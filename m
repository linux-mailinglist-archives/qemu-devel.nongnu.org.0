I doubt this. Whenever I get a bug report with a command line created by
libvirt, the command line is huge, but basically nothing in it uses
dotted syntax. Yes, you may have cache.direct=3Don in it somewhere, but
that's not actual nesting.

The problem is the amount of options that is specified by management
tools, and then humans are looking at it and feel it's way too complex.

Command lines written by human users are usually much simpler because
they just use QEMU's defaults instead of explicitly specifying
everything.

True. I would have liked a different syntax that used some kind of
brackets (at least optionally), but Markus didn't like adding another
character that must be escaped.

I think if we want, we can still evolve our human syntax to be more user
friendly. My impression was that we don't want to.

I see you merged the two -blockdev arguments into a single one in order
to get at least some repetition with the file.* prefixes. ;-)

JSON is usually easy enough to read, quite reasonable for making minor
modifications, and a PITA for writing something (like a QMP request)
from scratch.

This seems to have the same problems as the QEMU command line (how do
you distinguish strings from ints, from bools, from null?). It's
basically just a pretty-printed version of it with the consequence that
it needs to be stored in an external file and there is no reasonable way
to keep it in my shell history.

Hi! :-)

Well, not fighting for it to the death and I'm certainly not married to
its exact syntax, but I use HMP all the time because it's convenient to
use manually and QMP isn't.

If you want to remove HMP, get us a decent QMP shell first. And ideally
a way how to use it without manually configuring a QMP socket and
starting up and connecting the shell to it with ten kilometers of
command line options on both sides first. HMP is available by default,
and so should its replacement be.

As a developer I would love this because so many things in the current
design are wrong. As a user I would hate it because this kind of "2.0"
release tends to break lots of features I like. (Anyone remember KDE 4?)
