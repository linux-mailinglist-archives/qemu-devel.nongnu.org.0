And vhost-vsock actually really seems to be modern-only, see below.

Ok, I tried this now with an x86 host and an s390x guest. Reverted the
checking commit, tried both with a -ccw and a -pci device and your ncat
example.
- When using virtio-1, both devices work fine.
- When using the -pci device with disable-modern=yes, I get "reset by
  peer".
- When using the -ccw device with max_revision=0, I get an instant
  timeout.

Smells like endianness problems (aka weird things are happening).

Also noticed that vhost-vsock-ccw does not have an immediate problem,
even with the commit: The code only checks whether the device has been
forced to legacy, not whether legacy is allowed (which cannot be
controlled by the user anyway). Probably best to address after we've
dealt with the vhost-vsock issue and made sure that there are no other
problems.

It seems to me that the status before this was "works by accident, but
only if we're not negotiating to legacy, or the guest/host are both
little endian". IOW, no visible breakage for most people (or we'd
probably have heard of it already). Now we have a setup that's correct,
but forces users to adapt their QEMU command lines. Option 1 would
eliminate the need to do that, but would cause possibly
not-really-fixable migration issues (you can probably deal with that
manually, detaching and re-attaching the device as a last resort.)

So, force modern, probably also remove the -transitional device type,
and put a prominent explanation into the change log?
