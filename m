These only cover pcie hotplug, is this feature somehow dependent on
pcie?  There's also ACPI-based PCI hotplug, SHPC hotplug, and it looks
like s390 has it's own version (of course) of PCI hotplug.  IMO, we
either need to make an attempt to support this universally or the
option needs to fail if the hotplug controller doesn't support partial
removal.  Thanks,

Alex
