Turns it into an example, which is a good way of explaining things that

Technically no, though it's probably the first assumption of most
people. It's just a suggestion for clarification, feel free to ignore
it.

When you're the author, the meaning of everything is clear to you. :-)

In case of doubt, I would be more explicit so that the comment gives a
clear guideline for which role to use in which scenario.

Okay. Shall we document it explicitly like we do for the filter role?

Well, yes, this is exceptional. I would ignore that property for
assigning roles because when it comes to play, roles don't matter any
more because the whole process is gone. So...

...I don't think this case is relevant. If blkverify returns something,
both children have the same data.

Maybe the missing part for me is what FILTERED is even used for. I
assume it's for skipping over filters in certain functions in the
generic block layer?

In this case, maybe the right answer is that...

...blkverify isn't one either because performing an operation on only
one child usually won't be correct.

Because it's the copy that is used to check whether the main image is
correct. If things break, you just create a new copy. At least that's
how blkverify was supposed to be used.

In fact, I guess in the typical use cases for blkverify, cache=3Dunsafe is
enough anyway because you would start over from scratch, so... not a
strong argument.

Either option should be fine. I guess documenting it is less work.

*shrug* I was just asking to see if I understand things right. We could
document it, but I don't have a good reason why we must do that.

Maybe the more relevant question would be if a FILTERED child must be
the only child to avoid the problems we're discussing for blkverify. But
I think I already answered that question for myself with "no", so
probably not much use asking it.
