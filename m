Which by the way fail on some targets:

Have you managed a clean check-tcg with docker enabled so all the guest
architectures get tested?

*sharp intake of breath*

OK so the solution to the complexity of handling threads is to add more
threads? cool cool cool....

We could consider a custom lib stub that intercepts calls to the guests
original libc and replaces it with a QEMU aware one?

Have you considered a daemon which could co-ordinate between the
multiple processes that are sharing some state?
