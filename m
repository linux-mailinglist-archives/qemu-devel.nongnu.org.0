I get you now so I think not.

Maybe we need document the expected behavior of VHOST_USER_GET_FEATURES 
e.g which set of features that must be advertised explicitly.

And for the set you mention here, we probably need to add:

VIRTIO_F_ORDER_PLATFORM,
VIRTIO_F_ANY_LAYOUT (not sure if it was too late).

And

VIRTIO_F_IN_ORDER

That will be better.

That's fine or maybe just do features |= vhost_default_feature_bits 
inside vhost_get_features().

Thanks
