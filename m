From: Vladimir Sementsov-Ogievskiy <vsementsov@virtuozzo.com>

qcow2_inc_refcounts_imrt() (through realloc_refcount_array()) can eat
an unpredictable amount of memory on corrupted table entries, which are
referencing regions far beyond the end of file.

Prevent this, by skipping such regions from further processing.

Interesting that iotest 138 checks exactly the behavior which we fix
here. So, change the test appropriately.
