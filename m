Thanks for picking these up - I've been AFK for the past week :)

What was the issue with patch 9 "dp8393x: fix CAM descriptor entry index"? That patch 
ensures that the CAM index is read from the descriptor, and not taken from the for() 
loop i.e. it is unrelated to register access size. See section 4.1.1 "The Load CAM 
Command" in the DP83932C datasheet for more information.


ATB,

Mark.
