Got it. Sounds reasonable to me.

Yep, I can get rid of the bogus devices this way. Thanks!

Yes, indeed!

Confirmed. The example works like a charm. One difference between
the runtime-created and DTS-created gpiochips is the name:
 - gpio-aggregator.<number>, for the ones created via sysfs
 - <name-of-DTS-node>, for the ones created via DTS

Seeing this behavior on my target, I believe the expectations of
Harish should be met w/o any major limitations.

The recent [v3] discussion actually applies to [v4], for which I did
review and testing. Will relay the signatures to the latest version.

Thank you very much.
