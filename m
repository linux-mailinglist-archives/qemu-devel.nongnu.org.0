The end of each iteration is an implicit synchronization point in the
current migration code.

For example, we might do 2 iterations of migration pre-copy, and then
switch to post-copy mode. If the data from those 2 iterations hasn't
been sent at the point we switch to post-copy, that is a semantic
change from current behaviour. I don't know if that will have an
problematic effect on the migration process, or not. Checking the
async completions at the end of each iteration though, would ensure
the semantics similar to current semantics, reducing risk of unexpected
problems.

Something like that - depends what API we end up deciding on

That would introduce a coupling  between the two QIOChannel impls
though, which is avoided so far, because we didn't want an assuption
that a QIOChannel == a FD.
