In the end, I think I will calculate the size based on host-page-size
and the number of possible guest cpus. The main reason is that it's
actually more awkward to properly document it in a comment than to just
code it. And, we'll also reduce the number of pages that would need to
be migrated when the host is using 4k pages.
