(1) Because .abort() must always succeed.  What I=E2=80=99m proposing is =
a
solution where we have to actively roll back, and that may not always wor=
k.

(2) Intuitively, I=E2=80=99d think it=E2=80=99d be easier to modify the c=
entral block
layer instead of having to check/modify all drivers that (A) their
prepare does everything, and (B) their abort can still roll back.  I may
well be wrong.

Maybe that is the easier solution.  .commit() would then just be a
cleanup, right?

If abort can roll back.

Well, "just".  It=E2=80=99s not just this one driver.

No, I don=E2=80=99t.
