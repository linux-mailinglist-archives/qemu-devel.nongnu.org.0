it's not the only place in GED that is trying to add to system address
space, optionally if called acpi_memory_hotplug_init() will do the same,
then later we could add cpu hotplug memory region over there.

Perhaps we could use bus-less device plug code path,
in that case memory_region_init_io()/qdev_init_gpio_out_named()
should be moved to ged_initfn() and mapping part into specialized helper
(similar to pc_dimm_plug() ) that's called by board (from virt_machine_device_plug_cb)
callback during completing device realize stage, it would be something like:

virt.c:
   virt_machine_device_plug_cb()
      if dev == GED_TYPE
        machine_ged_plug_helper(system_memory)

generic_event_device.c:
   machine_ged_plug_helper(as, irq) // similar to sysbus_mmio_map() but ged specialized
      connect_irq()
      memory_region_add_subregion(as, ged->ged_base, &ged->io)
      if ged->memory-hotplug-support
          memory_region_add_subregion(as, ged->memhp_base , &ged->memhp_state.memhp_io)


in this case addresses could be normally hard-codded in board code if device is not optional
(as in patch 6/9: create_acpi_ged() )
or potentially they could come from CLI as -device parameters
(/me thinking about building blocks that allow to create machine from config)

sysbus device might be fine as shortcut if we are thinking about
only creating device during machine_init (although I have a reservations towards
sysbus interface (ex: caller of sysbus_mmio_map() has no clue when mapping N-th
region at some address)).
