I'm in agreement with Peter, here: if "max" is user-visible, it's
better to make it provide more usable defaults.

We don't need to create new CPU types for that, do we?  These
different modes could be configured by a CPU option (e.g.
"z13,features=3Dmax"[1], "z13,features=3Dbest").

If we do add new CPU options to tune feature defaults, libvirt
can start using these options on query-cpu-model-expansion, and
everybody will be happy.  No need to change defaults in the "max"
CPU model in a way that makes it less usable just to make
query-cpu-model-expansion work.

[1] Probably we need to call it something else instead of
    "features=3Dmax", just to avoid confusion with the "max" CPU
    model.  Maybe "experimental-features=3Don",
    "recommended-features=3Don"?
