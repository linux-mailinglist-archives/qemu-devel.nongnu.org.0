But

Well in this case the user wouldn't be reading or accepting any EULA,
because this 3rd party site doesn't provide any such things with the
firmware it is re-distributing.

IOW, the only way the user can use this device is to download the
firmware from this 3rd site & ignore the lack of legal information
they provide about license/distribution rules.
