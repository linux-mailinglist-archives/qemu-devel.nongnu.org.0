OK, good to hear that.

Which should be covered by the following job (relevant snippets only):

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-alldbg:
 ...
 - ./configure --enable-debug --disable-libssh
 - make clean
 - make
 - make check V=3D1

>  * a non-debug build

I assume the following is a suitable non-debug build:

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-all:
 ...
 script:
 - ./configure --disable-libssh
 - make
 - make check V=3D1

>  * a linux-user --static build

This is roughly the job to fulfill this requirement:

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-all-linux-static:
 ...
 # --disable-libssh is needed because of https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+b=
ug/1838763
 # --disable-glusterfs is needed because there's no static version of those=
 libs in distro supplied packages
 - ./configure --enable-debug --static --disable-system --disable-glusterfs=
 --disable-libssh
 - make
 - make check V=3D1
 - make check-tcg V=3D1

>  * a clang build with the sanitizers enabled [+]

I've tested the following which includes the sanitizers but drops the
'--enable-gtk' option:

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-clang:
 ...
 - ./configure --disable-libssh --cc=3Dclang --cxx=3Dclang++ --enable-sanit=
izers
 - make
 - make check V=3D1

>  * windows crossbuilds

OK, there weren't any windows crossbuilds jobs in this version but I'm
adding them (32 and 64 bits).

>  * a --disable-tcg build

Which should be covered by the following job definition:

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-notcg:
 ...
 - ./configure --disable-libssh --disable-tcg
 - make
 - make check V=3D1

>  * an --enable-tci-interpreter build

Which should be covered by:

ubuntu-18.04.3-x86_64-tci:
 ...
 - ./configure --disable-libssh --enable-tcg-interpreter
 - make

I'm not sure yet how to cleanly accomplish this.  IIRC it suggests
working with different versions of the code in a single job.
GitLab will usually give you the code matching the commit you're
testing.  I believe I could do something like:

 - git reset --hard HEAD~X
 - configure ...
 - make
 - git checkout $PREVIOUS_HEAD
 - make

But I'll have to experiment a bit more with it.

Thanks for the very straight answers here.  I'll work
on those two remaining points (windows cross builds, and
incremental builds).

Please let me know if I misunderstood any of your points.

Thanks,
