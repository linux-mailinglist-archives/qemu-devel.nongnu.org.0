We don't translate '=' markup to rST. We use it as the way
the input document tells us about the structure of the
tree of docutils sections it wants us to create. No rST
markup is ever involved in that process.

If we wanted to do something with '# == something' in actual
chunks of doc comment, we would have to specifically scan
the doc comment for that. Currently we simply pass doc
comments to the rST parser to be parsed. Then you have
to document the syntax of a doc comment as "rST, except
that as a special case a line starting == doesn't do what
it does in normal rST text but is a syntax error".

What I would like is:
 * doc comments are simply rST, and we interpret them as
   rST by passing them directly to the rST parser. (We do
   special case the "@var means ``var``" markup, but I
   would rather keep to a minimum the number of things we
   special case in that way.)
 * headings and subheadings affect the entire document
   structure; they are not rST source and are never
   interpreted as rST source or sent to the rST parser.
   They are a thing all of their own, not a bit of markup
   within a larger doc comment.
 * not to gratuitously change the way we in practice
   mark up headings in our document, because that makes
   the texi->rST transition harder for no clear gain.
   If we absolutely must mark them up in some other way
   than we do today, I can implement that, but it feels
   like unnecessary work.

Yes. I could treat all freeform comments that aren't
the special one-line heading/subheading as being normal
freeform comments, which would avoid this inconsistency.
That's probably better.

Yes, we no longer have a test case for "do we generate what we
expect to". That's harder to do with a Sphinx extension because
we don't ever output rST source anywhere that we could compare
to an expected version. (We still have the existing tests that
the doc comments spit out by parser.py match expected output.)
I'm dubious about running Sphinx and comparing the generated HTML
because that seems like it would be vulnerable to test failures
if Sphinx internals change the fine detail of how it outputs HTML.

Do you mean: could we make the implementation take a freeform
comment block like:

##
# = Foo
#
# Some text
#
# = Bar
#
# More text
##

and parse through that text to split it up into

- "start new level-1 section with heading 'Foo'"
- "a freeform comment block '\nSome text\n\n'" (for current section)
- "start new level-1 section with heading 'Bar'"
- "a freeform comment block '\nMore text\n\n'" (for current section)

so that the input rST doesn't need to mark off the headings
as being in their own freeform comment block ?

Yes, we could do that, and it wouldn't be too hard.
My issues with that are:

(1) you now don't have a way to literally write '= Foo'
to be interpreted the way that rST would interpret it
in a comment block that's otherwise just "any
rST markup is fine".

(2) it falsely suggests that headings are OK in
doc comment blocks and are just another kind of
markup within a doc comment, when they aren't, and
we're really just providing syntactic sugar here

(3) it obscures the actual structure of the
document, which is

 [root node]
  [section]
     [title 'Foo']
     [Text 'Some text']
  [section]
     [title 'Bar']
     [Text 'More text']

where "Some text" and "More text" are in entirely
different sections, even though they're in the same
doc comment block. (If 'Foo' is a subsection and
'Bar' a section, the text can end up even further
separated within the document tree.)

(4) it breaks a general approach within the handling
of doc comments, which is that we build the document
based on the various bits of information about the
symbol, etc, but a chunk of text from a document
comment is handled simply by handing it off to
the rST parser, not by doing some script-specific
pre-parsing and mangling of it and then handing it
to the rST parser. This in turn means that we need
to document the syntax of comment blocks as not
just "it's rST with the @var-means-``var`` extra"
but "it's rST, with @var-means-``var``, and = Foo
is invalid most places but within a freeform block
means this other thing". I think that minimising
the number of extras we add on top of "the syntax
for a block of text in a doc comment is rST"
makes things less confusing.
