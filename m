fdt_get_path() will return -FDT_ERR_NOSPACE if the path doesn't fit in
the provided buffer.  I think that's enough to fail in the relevant
cases.  You could then use a buffer of size min(client provided size,
fixed max size).

I believe I've thought of trying to implement something that returns
what the path length would be without constructing it, but it turns
out to be essentially impossible given the fdt format and the fact
that we don't allocate inside libfdt (basically we have to use the
partially constructed path buf as state information to know how to
proceed with our scan).

Yeah... IEEE1275 says that, but I don't think most OF implementations
enforce it.  I'm also pretty sure that limit is broken by device trees
in the wild (I remember investigating this when implementing dtc &
libfdt).

Oh.. yeah, sorry, I think you'd need address_space_translate() or
something like it to locate the right MR first.  Which come to think
of it, validates / truncates the length to, so..

=2E. I think that would work after all.
