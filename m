Yes, the vector table and PBA are emulated in QEMU, the latter lazily
only when vectors are masked, iirc.  The backing device vector table
should never be directly accessed by the user (it can be, but you can
just discard those accesses), MSI-X is configured via the
VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl, which configures the eventfd through which
an mdev driver would trigger an MSI.  When you say that you "fire and
MSI-X interrupt from the virtual device" does this mean that you're
signaling via one of these eventfds?  It looks to me like emulating the
MSI-X enable bit in the MSI-X capability is probably the responsibility
of the mdev vendor driver.  With vfio-pci the VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl
would enable MSI-X on the physical device and the MSI-X capability seen
by the user would reflect that.  Are you missing a bit of code that
updates the mdev config space as part of the SET_IRQS ioctl?  Thanks,

Alex
