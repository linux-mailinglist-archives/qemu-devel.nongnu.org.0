hi Alex
we're in the process of porting to this code, and now it's able to
migrate successfully without dirty pages.

when there're dirty pages, we met several issues.
one of them is reported here
(https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-04/msg00004.html).
dirty pages for some regions are not able to be collected correctly,
especially for memory range from 3G to 4G.

even without this bug, qemu still got stuck in middle before
reaching stop-and-copy phase and cannot be killed by admin.
still in debugging of this problem.

Thanks
Yan
