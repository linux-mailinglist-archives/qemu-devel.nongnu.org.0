I don't believe that's the case.  The CLI args above are just illustrating
that it is now possible to *optionally* not specify the VFIO device on the
CLI. This is because previous versions of the patchset *always* required
the device on the CLI due to a circular dependancy in the CLI syntax. This
patch series version fixed that limitation, so now the VFIO device can be
cold plugged or hotplugged as desired.

Yes, the management application that triggers the migration will need to
pass in a new XML document to libvirt when starting the migration so that
we use the suitable new device on the target host.

My understanding is that QEMU takes care of this.

I don't thin we need that.

The mgmt app should pass the new device details in the XML when starting
migration. Shouldn't be a big deal as OpenStack already does that for 
quite a few other parts of the config.

IIUC, we should be binding to vfio-pci during the prepare phase of the
migration, since that's when QEMU is started by libvirt on the target.

I don't believe so, since we'll be able to cold plug it during prepare
phase.
