Probably my image was corrupt since it works with another image. So this
bug can be closed.

Title:
  qemu-img convert file.vmdk: Invalid footer

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Steps to reproduce
  - Open ESXi 6.5 Web UI
  - Export OVF
  - qemu-img convert disk.vmdk disk.qcow2

  Error:

      qemu-img: Could not open './disk-1.vmdk': Invalid footer

  I found another person having this problem here:
  https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/error-converting-vmdk-file-to-qcow2-fil=
e.38264/
  As I guess from the answer, the guy went over to manually copy the flat f=
ile from the datastore instead of using the ovf-exported file.

  Nevertheless, I think this bug should be investigated further and
  closed. Probably it is just some metadata issue and should not be too
  hard to fix once the root of the problem is found.
