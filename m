Yes. Explicit node names cannot begin with '#', while all generated node 
names do.

In the -drive case (historical libvirt), the block device is named, and 
node names are generated (it may be possible to use -drive and still 
create explicit node names, but libvirt will never do that).  You can 
create a bitmap using either ('drive-name','bitmap-name'), or 
('generated-node-name','bitmap-name'), but for the purposes of 
migration, only the 'drive-name' variant is migrateable.

In the -blockdev case (upcoming libvirt), the block device is anonymous, 
and all node names are given by libvirt.  Thus, you can only create a 
bitmap using ('node-name','bitmap-name'), but it is also obvious that 
migration will use the 'node-name' variant.

The obvious case I see is that if we have a source:

Backing.qcow2 (contains bitmap1) <- Active.qcow2 (contains bitmap2)

and we want to migrate AND flatten at the same time, but still preserve 
the bitmaps as a record of changes between the points in time, then 
libvirt needs a way to specify migration to:

Flattened.qcow2 (contains bitmap1 and bitmap2)

No matter which node name libvirt assigns to Flattened.qcow2, at least 
one of the two bitmaps on the source will be migrated to a different 
node name on the destination, while still giving the net result of a 
bitmap logically associated with the drive (and not any particular node).

As long as a bitmap never has both names non-generated, we should be 
fine (it either has an explicit drive name and generated node name, or 
it has no drive name and an explicit node name).
