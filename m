Hi,

When we introduced filters, we did it a bit casually.  Sure, we talked a
lot about them before, but that was mostly discussion about where
implicit filters should be added to the graph (note that we currently
only have two implicit filters, those being mirror and commit).  But in
the end, we really just designated some drivers filters (Quorum,
blkdebug, etc.) and added some specifically (throttle, COR), without
really looking through the block layer to see where issues might occur.

It turns out vast areas of the block layer just don=E2=80=99t know about =
filters
and cannot really handle them.  Many cases will work in practice, in
others, well, too bad, you cannot use some feature because some part
deep inside the block layer looks at your filters and thinks they are
format nodes.

This is one reason why this series is needed.  Over time (since v1), a
second reason has made its way in:

bs->file is not necessarily the place where a node=E2=80=99s data is stor=
ed.
qcow2 now has external data files, and currently there is no way for the
general block layer to know that the data is not stored in bs->file.
Right now, I do not think that has any real consequences (all functions
that need access to the actual data storage file should only do so as a
fallback if the driver does not provide some functionality, but qcow2
should provide it all), but it still shows that we need some way to let
the general block layer know about such data files.  (Also, I will need
this for v1 of my =E2=80=9CInquire images=E2=80=99 rotational info=E2=80=9D=
 series.)

I won=E2=80=99t go on and on about this series now, I think the patches p=
retty
much speak for themselves now.  If the cover letter gets too long,
nobody reads it anyway (see previous versions).


*** This series depends on some others. ***

Dependencies:
- [PATCH 0/4] block: Keep track of parent quiescing
- [PATCH 0/2] vl: Drain before (block) job cancel when quitting
- [PATCH v2 0/2] blockdev: Overlays are not snapshots

v5:
- Split the huge patches 2 and 3 from the previous version into many
  smaller patches to maintain the potential reviewers=E2=80=99 sanity [Vl=
adimir]

- Added support for compressed writes to the COR and throttle filter
  drivers to demonstrate how that looks, because the backup job needs to
  deal with filters that have such support

- Added differentiation between bdrv_storage_child(),
  bdrv_primary_child(), and bdrv_metadata_child()

- A whole lot of things Vladimir has noted

- Made the block jobs really work with filters.  In case of commit and
  stream, this now means that filters go away if they are between top
  and base.  I think that=E2=80=99s OK because it=E2=80=99s the user=E2=80=
=99s choice to include
  filters or not.  (They can move the filters around if they prefer a
  different result.)
  - This changes the =E2=80=9CAdd filter commit test cases=E2=80=9D from =
checking that
    most things do not work to checking that they do

- Added the =E2=80=9Cblockdev: Fix active commit choice=E2=80=9D patch be=
cause it turned
  out this became necessary after I allowed committing through and with
  filters.
