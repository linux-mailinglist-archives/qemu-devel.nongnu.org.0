Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  Add scale options to window menu

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  This is a workaround against bug #504368, which makes QEMU window text
  blurry if resized. This is a common and annoying problem:

  http://butnottoohard.blogspot.com/2010/01/qemukvm-windows-7-blurry-text.h=
tml
  http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60564/how-can-i-restore-default-w=
indow-size-in-kvm-qemu

  =

  The ability to resize window is a feature - it allows to adjust viewport =
of QEMU to the convenient working area. But there should be an option to re=
store the size of the window or scale it like 1:2, 2:1 etc. I don't know ab=
out if that should be exposed to QEMU monitor as some "window <command>" se=
t , but it would be extremely convenient to provide at least Ctrl+Alt+U fun=
ctionality through window level menu.

  Ubuntu 13.04, QEMU 1.4.0
