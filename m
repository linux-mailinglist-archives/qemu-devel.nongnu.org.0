I sent the results on a reply to Brian.

To be clear, I'm not trying to advocate for or against qcow2 on xfs, we
were just analyzing different allocation strategies for qcow2 and we
came across these results which we don't quite understand.

I think Brian pointed it out already, but scenario (4) is rather
falloc(25GB), then QEMU is launched and the actual 4k IO requests start
to happen.

So I would expect that after falloc(25GB) all clusters are initialized
and the end result would be closer to a full preallocation (i.e. writing
25GB worth of zeroes to disk).

Yes, that's clear, once everything is allocation then it is fast (and
really much faster in the case of xfs vs ext4), what we try to optimize
in qcow2 is precisely the allocation of new clusters.
