If you mean that they introduced new jobs, you're right.

Right, I do not doubt these jobs may be useful to other people and on
scenarios other than "before merging a patch series".

Do you imply that every gitlab CI job should be a gating job?  And
that the same jobs should be used when other people with their own
forks?  I find this problematic because:

* It would trigger pipelines with jobs that, unless every user has the
  same runners configured, would have unfulfilled jobs that don't have
  a matching hardware.

* It dilutes the idea that those jobs are inherently different with
  regards to the management of their infrastructure.

* It destroys the notion of layered testing, for whatever people find
  that worth it, where a faster turnaround could/would be possible
  with fewer jobs for every push, and many more jobs before a merge.

Finally, I find the split by runner architecture you suggested
problematic because different organizations may have jobs for the same
architecture.  I believe that files for different organizations may be
a better organization instead.  Entries in the MAINTAINERS are one
example where the grouping by architecture may not be optimal.

I've come across so many caveats and corner cases that having the
lowest common denominator proved to be the smart and sane thing to do.
For instance, building on the example you gave, running a RHEL 8
aarch64 host is a NO GO Today because RHEL 8 doesn't ship with docker
and the gitlab runner needs to be taught to talk to, say, Podman.

gitlab-runner-helper images for different architectures, used to
prepare the docker images before running jobs, also proved to be a
challenge.

Finally, it's going to be very important for some organizations to
run tests outside of container environments.  For instance, Red Hat
needs to run QEMU+KVM tests on bare metal and on VMs, in addition
to containers.

Like I explained before, containers-only won't cut it.  So, we need
tooling that is environment agnostic.  So far, ansible playbooks seem
to be a reasonable solution.  But duplicating information bothers me
as much as it seems to bother you, so we need to engage in common
tooling that is capable of generating those container environments,
but not be limited to it.  One example of a tool that seems to be
a good candidate is "Libvirt's" lcitool.

Thanks for taking the time to give this feedback, and for making me
check again the premises that led to the proposal of this design.

Hopefully, this will be an improvement over the current state of
"pre-merge" testing, and at the same time can be the first step
towards a scenario that has more of the characteristics you pointed
out.

Best!
