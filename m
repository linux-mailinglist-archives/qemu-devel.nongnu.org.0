Vladimir, thank you for outlining the current state of affairs regarding=20
efficient backup. I'd like to describe what we know about the=20
image-expansion problem we're having using the current (qemu 4.2.0) code,=20
just to be sure that your work is addressing it.

In our use case, the image-expansion problem occurs only when the source=20
disk file and the target backup file are in different file systems. Both=20
files are qcow2 files, and as long as they both reside in the same file=20
system, the target file winds up with roughly the same size as the source. =

But if the target is in another file system (we've tried a second ext4=20
hard disk file system, a tmpfs file system, and fuse-based file systems=20
such as s3fs), the target ends up with a size comparable to the nominal=20
size of the source disk.

I think the expansion is related to this comment in=20
qemu/include/block/block.h:

/**
 * bdrv=5Fco=5Fcopy=5Frange:
. . . .
 * Note: block layer doesn't emulate or fallback to a bounce buffer=20
approach
 * because usually the caller shouldn't attempt offloaded copy any more=20
(e.g.
 * calling copy=5Ffile=5Frange(2)) after the first error, thus it should fa=
ll=20
back
 * to a read+write path in the caller level.

The bdrv=5Fco=5Fcopy=5Frange() service does the right things with respect t=
o=20
skipping unallocated ranges in the source disk and not writing zeros to=20
the target. But qemu gives up on using this service the first time an=20
underlying copy=5Ffile=5Frange() system call fails, and copy=5Ffile=5Frange=
()=20
always fails with EXDEV when the source and destination files are on=20
different file systems. In this specific case (at least), I think that=20
falling back to a bounce buffer approach would make sense so that we don't =

lose the rest of the logic in bdrv=5Fco=5Fcopy=5Frange. As it is, qemu fall=
s=20
back on a very high-level loop reading from the source and writing to the=20
target. At this high level, reading an unallocated range from the source=20
simply returns a buffer full of zeroes, with no indication that the range=20
was unallocated. The zeroes are then written to the target as if they were =

real data.

As a quick experiment, I tried a very localized fallback when=20
copy=5Ffile=5Frange returns EXDEV in handle=5Faiocb=5Fcopy=5Frange() in=20
qemu/block/file-posix.c. It's not a great fix because it has to allocate=20
and free a buffer on the spot and it does not head off future calls to=20
copy=5Ffile=5Frange that will also fail, but it does fix the image-expansio=
n=20
problem when crossing file systems. I can provide the patch if anyone=20
wants to see it.

I just wanted to get this aspect of the problem onto the table, to make=20
sure it gets addressed in the current rework. Maybe it's a non-issue=20
already.

- Bryan
