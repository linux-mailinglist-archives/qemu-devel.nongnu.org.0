Yes. Maybe rename it to gctx-ld ?

hmmm, except at the moment it doesn't include the VMSAs, because I don't
know an easy way to do it within QEMU :-( .  So the content of
debug-launch-digest is currently incorrect for SEV-ES guests.

The scenario we are encountering is that there's not one allowed
assignment to the parameters, but rather a more relaxed policy along the
lines of:

API_MAJOR.API_MINOR should be >= 12.34
BUILD should be >= 66
GCTX.POLICY should be 0x0 or 0x2
GCTX.LD can be one of these allowed OVMFs: {hash-a, hash-b, hash-c}


Having the values of API*, BUILD, POLICY from query-sev is very
comfortable for verifying they are in the allowed ranges.  But since the
Guest Owner doesn't have GCTX.LD, they have to compute the measurement
for each of the allowed OVMF images.  Once the values are known and
"allowed", then the HMAC must be computed to see that the signed
measurement does indeed match.

Note: I guess that adding the hashes of kernel/initrd/cmdline here might
help too (for direct boot with kernel-hashes=on), and maybe the hash of
OVMF itself (on its own).

More generally: within space/network constraints, give the Guest Owner
all the information it needs to compute the launch measurement.  There's
a problem with OVMF there (we don't want to send the whole 4 MB over the
QMP response, but given its hash we can't "extend" it to include the
kernel-hashes struct).

I think that adding the extra field is not that bad, even if it's useful
just for some cases.

I'll be glad to get rid of the launch_memory buffer in my implementation
and replace it with a SHA256-context variable (but found none in QEMU).
 Other than that I don't think the suggested addition is too bad (in
fact, I would add some more info like kernel hashes.).

Another point of reference is the session::verify() function in the sev
crate [1], but it doesn't deal with VMSAs and kernel-hashes either.
