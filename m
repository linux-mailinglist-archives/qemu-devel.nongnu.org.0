Sounds like it could be done, indeed. But I wonder whether we really
really want to silence the warnings here? We'd hide the information to
the users that sasl is apparently disliked by Apple and might get
removed on macOS in the future.

Maybe we should rather change the "configure" script to disable sasl by
default on macOS unless the user explicitely specified --enable-vnc-sasl ?
