Hmm. I was trying to make it obvious that bitmap size is separate from=20
fully-allocated (and not double-counted), but you may have a point that=20
just using "Additional size required for bitmap metadata, when that=20
metadata can be copied in addition..." would work.

The patch will require a tweak to report an explicit 0 (when there is=20
nothing to be copied), but doing that makes sense (explicit 0 for v3=20
qcow2 images, and maybe even for v2, but omitted for other formats that=20
have no bitmap support).

POSIX requires CHAR_BIT to be 8.  (C99 allows some odd machines where=20
CHAR_BIT is 9, 16, or even 32, but we don't ever try to port to such=20
machines).

Feels like duplicate work, which would require tweaking in two spots if=20
we ever change our implementation or the qcow2 format is further=20
enhanced, but it would also make it obvious that we are aware of the=20
impact of such future changes. Okay, I'll see what I can add.
