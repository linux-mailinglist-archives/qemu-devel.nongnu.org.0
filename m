Shucks.

This patch happened because the old SRST code reset the IDE state 
machine (cleared the status register) but then didn't cancel any of the 
pending callbacks, so it was possible to shuffle the state machine off 
the rails onto junk data. Obviously bad.

Now, SRST actually cancels the callbacks which I thought would have been 
safe, but it's possible that doing a "real" reset here is touching more 
registers than it ought to.

Let's take a look at the linux source code ...

/* Let the user know. We don't want to disallow opens for 

    rescue purposes, or in case the vendor is just a blithering 

    idiot. Do this after the dev_config call as some controllers 

    with buggy firmware may want to avoid reporting false device 

    bugs */

Ah, always a nice day to be called an idiot. Thank you for your service, 
Alan Cox.

This message gets printed when ATA_HORKAGE_DIAGNOSTIC is set. 
libata-sff.c suggests this happens when the error register* comes back 
0x00 after an SRST.

(*I think that tf.feature is only feature on writes, but error on reads. 
Same address.)

Now, ide_reset -- which we use for initialization and resets both always 
sets the error register to 0x00. libata thinks that 0x00 means a failed 
diagnostics test, though.

This ought to be covered by ATA8-APT. Section 9.2, Software reset protocol.

Cliff notes:

- Host writes to SRST and waits for 5 μs.
- Both devices obey the SRST write, regardless of drive selection.
- Each device clears their registers and sets BSY (within 400ns.)
- Host clears SRST and waits for at least 2ms.
- Host polls devices, waiting for BSY to be 0.


device0 can set bit7 in the error register to 0 or 1, depending on the 
presence or absence of device1 and how it behaves following a diagnostic 
test.


Device 1 is absent: bit7 is cleared.
Device 1 is present:
   - If PDIAG- is asserted, bit7 is cleared.
   - If PDIAG- is not asserted within 31 seconds, bit7 is set.

Then, ah:

The EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSTICS diagnostic code shall be placed in bits 
(6:0) of the Error register (See Clause 0). The device shall set the 
signature values (See Clause 0). The content of the Features register is 
undefined.

I got this pretty wrong. I'm seeing a few problems:

1. I thought SRST was triggered on the falling edge, but that's not 
entirely true. BSY should be set immediately and the SRST can begin as 
soon as possible. The device does not seem to have any interaction with 
the SRST bit being cleared from what I can tell.

2. We aren't running the diagnostic command, actually. That should fix 
this particular case. The old version of the code had an open-coded 
version of this, but it wasn't clear at the time this is what it was doing.

3. There are likely other things to handle relating to the 
presence/absence of device1 that we have never done for either version 
of the code.
