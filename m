Hello dann, or anyone else affected,

Accepted qemu into bionic-proposed. The package will build now and be
available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/1:2.11+dfsg-
1ubuntu7.30 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.

Please help us by testing this new package.  See
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation on how
to enable and use -proposed.  Your feedback will aid us getting this
update out to other Ubuntu users.

If this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug,
mentioning the version of the package you tested, what testing has been
performed on the package and change the tag from verification-needed-
bionic to verification-done-bionic. If it does not fix the bug for you,
please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-
failed-bionic. In either case, without details of your testing we will
not be able to proceed.

Further information regarding the verification process can be found at
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .  Thank you in
advance for helping!

N.B. The updated package will be released to -updates after the bug(s)
fixed by this package have been verified and the package has been in
-proposed for a minimum of 7 days.

** Changed in: qemu (Ubuntu Bionic)
       Status: In Progress =3D> Fix Committed

** Tags removed: verification-done-bionic
** Tags added: verification-needed verification-needed-bionic

Bug description:

  SRU TEAM REVIEWER: This has already been SRUed for Focal, Eoan and Bionic=
. Unfortunately the Bionic SRU did not work and we had to reverse the chang=
e. Since then we had another update and now I'm retrying the SRU.

  After discussing with @paelzer (and @dannf as a reviewer) extensively,
  Christian and I agreed that we should scope this SRU as Aarch64 only
  AND I was much, much more conservative in question of what is being
  changed in the AIO qemu code.

  New code has been tested against the initial Test Case and the new
  one, regressed for Bionic. More information (about tests and
  discussion) can be found in the MR at
  ~rafaeldtinoco/ubuntu/+source/qemu:lp1805256-bionic-refix

  BIONIC REGRESSION BUG:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1885419

  [Impact]

  * QEMU locking primitives might face a race condition in QEMU Async
  I/O bottom halves scheduling. This leads to a dead lock making either
  QEMU or one of its tools to hang indefinitely.

  [Test Case]

  INITIAL

  * qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 ./disk01.qcow2 ./output.qcow2

  Hangs indefinitely approximately 30% of the runs in Aarch64.

  [Regression Potential]

  * This is a change to a core part of QEMU: The AIO scheduling. It
  works like a "kernel" scheduler, whereas kernel schedules OS tasks,
  the QEMU AIO code is responsible to schedule QEMU coroutines or event
  listeners callbacks.

  * There was a long discussion upstream about primitives and Aarch64.
  After quite sometime Paolo released this patch and it solves the
  issue. Tested platforms were: amd64 and aarch64 based on his commit
  log.

  * Christian suggests that this fix stay little longer in -proposed to
  make sure it won't cause any regressions.

  * dannf suggests we also check for performance regressions; e.g. how
  long it takes to convert a cloud image on high-core systems.

  BIONIC REGRESSED ISSUE

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1885419

  [Other Info]

  =C2=A0* Original Description bellow:

  Command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 ./disk01.qcow2 ./output.qcow2

  Hangs indefinitely approximately 30% of the runs.

  ----

  Workaround:

  qemu-img convert -m 1 -f qcow2 -O qcow2 ./disk01.qcow2 ./output.qcow2

  Run "qemu-img convert" with "a single coroutine" to avoid this issue.

  <HUNG w/ 3 threads in the stack trace showed before>
  """

  All the tasks left are blocked in a system call, so no task left to call
  qemu_futex_wake() to unblock thread #2 (in futex()), which would unblock
  thread #1 (doing poll() in a pipe with thread #2).

  Those 7 threads exit before disk conversion is complete (sometimes in
  the beginning, sometimes at the end).

  ----

  On the HiSilicon D06 system - a 96 core NUMA arm64 box - qemu-img
  frequently hangs (~50% of the time) with this command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 /tmp/cloudimg /tmp/cloudimg2

  Where "cloudimg" is a standard qcow2 Ubuntu cloud image. This
  qcow2->qcow2 conversion happens to be something uvtool does every time
  it fetches images.

  Once hung, attaching gdb gives the following backtrace:
