Public bug reported:

Enabling hv-tlbflush on older hosts using Intel CPUs supporting VT-x but
neither EPT nor VPID will lead to bluescreens on the guest.

It seems KVM only checks if EPT is available, and if it isn't it
forcibly uses VPID. If that's *also* not available, it defaults to
basically a no-op hypercall, though windows is expecting the TLB to be
flushed.

hv-tlbflush is pretty useless on machines not supporting these
extensions anyway (only reasonably fix I can see would be to flush the
*entire* TLB on tlbflush hypercall in KVM (i.e. a kernel fix), but that
would remove any performance benefits), so I would suggest some kind of
preliminary check and warning/error if hv-tlbflush is specified on such
a host.

All CPUs mentioned in this thread[0] are confirmed to be affected by the
bug, and I have successfully reproduced it on an Intel Core2Duo E8500.
