Title:
  BIOS doesn't load when read() returns less than the full ROM length

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  When qemu is running over a 9p filesystem (e.g. when running
  underneath -virtfs of another qemu), and probably some other network
  filesystems, it fails to read its BIOS image.  This is because it uses
  a single low-level read() call on the bios.bin, asking for the full
  file.  However read() may return less than the full length, and it's
  the caller's responsibility to call it repeatedly if necessary.  When
  read does come up short, qemu doesn't repeat the call, and reports an
  error instead.  The attached patch fixes the one problem I saw, but I
  haven't tried to cover the general case (e.g. extension ROMs).
