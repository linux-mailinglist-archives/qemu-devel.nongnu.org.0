Generally I tend to agree.  For kvmtool I leaned torward quadwords
purely because

	16,32,48,64,80,96,112,128,144,160,176,192,208

is a big pain to type compared with

	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13

Even though I prefer to specify vector lengths in bytes everywhere else
in the Linux user API (precisely to avoid the confusion you object to).

This isn't finalised yet for kvmtool -- I need to rework the patches
and may not include it at all initially: kvmtool doesn't support
migration, which is the main usecase for being able to specify an exact
set of vector lengths AFAICT.

Since this is otherwise only useful for migration, experimentation or
machine-driven configuration, a bitmask

	0x1fff

as some have suggested may well be a pragmatic alternative for kvmtool.

Cheers
