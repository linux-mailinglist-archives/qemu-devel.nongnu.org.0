A bit of an increase in code size, but I think it does reduce the 
overall complexity to treat ZERO_ALLOC like normal.  The patch is big, 
but I don't see any sane way to split it.  Overall, I like it.

syntax check wants you to wing this comment, now.

The rename makes sense.

Findings are minor and you can fix them up when dropping RFC.
