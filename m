Yes, I discovered today for example that the PCIe bus set auto-legacy
mode to off.

Yeah, it's a mess :-( anyway I still prefer option 1, it seems a little
bit more correct to me.

Sure, maybe the quickest way is to use ncat. Starting from version 7.80,
it supports AF_VSOCK sockets:

    host$ ./qemu-system-x86_64 ... -device vhost-vsock-pci,guest-cid=5

    host$ ncat --vsock -l 1234

    # vsock address is <cid, port>, cid=2 is used always to reach the host
    guest$ ncat --vsock 2 1234

Other tests that I usually run are:
- iperf-vsock: https://github.com/stefano-garzarella/iperf-vsock
- vsock test suite in the Linux kernel (tools/testing/vsock)

Let me know if you want more details on these :-)

Thanks,
Stefano
