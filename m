Almost our entire CI setup is built around use of docker and I don't
believe we really want to change that. Even ignoring GitLab, pretty
much all public CI services support use of docker containers for the
CI environment, so that's a defacto standard.

So while git gitlab runner agent can support many different execution
environments, I don't think we want to consider any except for the
ones that support containers (and that would need docker-in-docker
to be enabled too). Essentially we'll be using GitLab free CI credits
for most of the month. What we need is some extra private CI resource
that can pick up the the slack when we run out of free CI credits each
month. Thus the private CI resource needs to be compatible with the
public shared runners, by providing the same docker based environment[1].

It is a great shame that our current private runners ansible playbooks
were not configuring thue system for use with docker, as that would
have got us 90% of the way there already.



One thing to bear in mind is that a typical QEMU pipeline has 130 jobs
running.

Each gitlab shared runner is 1 vCPU, 3.75 GB of RAM, and we're using
as many as 60-70 of such instances at a time.  A single physical
machine probably won't cope unless it is very big.

To avoid making the overall pipeline wallclock time too long, we need
to be able to handle a large number of parallel jobs at certain times.
We're quite peaky in our usage. Some days we merge nothing and so
consume no CI. Some days we may merge many PRs and so consumes lots
of CI.  So buying lots of VMs to run 24x7 is quite wasteful. A burstab;le
container service is quite appealing


IIUC, GitLab's shared runners use GCP's  "spot" instances which are
cheaper than regular instances. The downside is that the VM can get
killed/descheduled if something higher priority needs Google's
resources. Not too nice for reliabilty, but excellant for cost saving.

With regards,
Daniel

[1] there are still several ways to achieve this.  A bare metal machine
    with a local install of docker, or podman, vs pointing to a public
    k8s instance that can run containers, and possibly other options
    too.
