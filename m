The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  configure script --extra-cflags not passed to config-meson.cross

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Since qemu 5.2, when building, the configure would not finish, but
  would return this error instead:

     qemu ../meson.build:852:2: ERROR: C header 'sasl/sasl.h' not found

  This is for a cross build, and I invoke qemu with the --extra-cflags
  and --extra-ldflags containing all the proper paths to the headers,
  libraries etc. It worked properly with qemu 3.1 to 5.1.

  After looking into the configure script, it seems that meson is passed
  the CFLAGS environment variable instead of QEMU_CFLAGS, and only the
  latter contains the --extra-cflags argument:

      echo "c_args =3D [${CFLAGS:+$(meson_quote $CFLAGS)}]" >> $cross

  Using the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variable instead of --extra-
  cflags and --extra-ldflags fixes the issue.
