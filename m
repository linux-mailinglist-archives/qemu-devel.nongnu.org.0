Hi,

This is v2 to =E2=80=9Cblock: Keep track of parent quiescing=E2=80=9D.

Please read this cover letter, because I=E2=80=99m very unsure about the =
design
in this series and I=E2=80=99d appreciate some comments.

As Kevin wrote in his reply to that series, the actual problem is that
bdrv_drain_invoke() polls on every node whenever ending a drain.  This
may cause graph changes, which is actually forbidden.

To solve that problem, this series makes the drain code construct a list
of undrain operations that have been initiated, and then polls all of
them on the root level once graph changes are acceptable.

Note that I don=E2=80=99t like this list concept very much, so I=E2=80=99=
m open to
alternatives.

Furthermore, all BdrvChildRoles with BDS parents have a broken
.drained_end() implementation.  The documentation clearly states that
this function is not allowed to poll, but it does.  So this series
changes it to a variant (using the new code) that does not poll.

There is a catch, which may actually be a problem, I don=E2=80=99t know: =
The new
variant of that .drained_end() does not poll at all, never.  As
described above, now every bdrv_drain_invoke() returns an object that
describes when it will be done and which can thus be polled for.  These
objects are just discarded when using BdrvChildRole.drained_end().  That
does not feel quite right.  It would probably be more correct to let
BdrvChildRole.drained_end() return these objects so the top level
bdrv_drained_end() can poll for their completion.

I decided not to do this, for two reasons:
(1) Doing so would spill the =E2=80=9Clist of objects to poll for=E2=80=9D=
 design to
    places outside of block/io.c.  I don=E2=80=99t like the design very m=
uch as
    it is, but I can live with it as long as it=E2=80=99s constrained to =
the
    core drain code in block/io.c.
    This is made worse by the fact that currently, those objects are of
    type BdrvCoDrainData.  But it shouldn=E2=80=99t be a problem to add a=
 new
    type that is externally visible (we only need the AioContext and
    whether bdrv_drain_invoke_entry() is done).

(2) It seems to work as it is.

The alternative would be to add the same GSList ** parameter to
BdrvChildRole.drained_end() that I added in the core drain code in patch
2, and then let the .drained_end() implementation fill that with objects
to poll for.  (Which would be accomplished by adding a frontend to
bdrv_do_drained_end() that lets bdrv_child_cb_drained_poll() pass the
parameter through.)

Opinions?


And then we have bdrv_replace_child_noperm(), which actually wants a
polling BdrvChildRole.drained_end().  So this series adds
BdrvChildRole.drained_end_unquiesce(), which takes that role (if there
is any polling to do).

Note that if I implemented the alternative described above
(.drained_end() gets said GSList ** parameter), a
.drained_end_unquiesce() wouldn=E2=80=99t be necessary.
bdrv_parent_drained_end_single() could just poll the list returned by
.drained_end() by itself.


Finally, patches 1, 8, and 9 are unmodified from v1.
