Hi Daniel,

I know this is nothing new to you, but "green" turning "red" is
something that can be minimized, but never completely abolished.
We've had discussions on how we could minimize those, and suggestions
on how to address those occurrences.  The points that I remember about
it are:

1. For jobs supposed to run on containers and vms, use images prepared
   to run the builds and tests, that is, don't do the prep steps
   (package installations and others) within the job itself - this is
   currently missing.

2. For bare metal, have the setup either documented or scripted and run
   before the jobs (in the patch series I sent, these were done in
   a number of Ansible based playbooks).

3. Have a mechanism for promoting non-gating jobs to gating jobs.  Keeping
   track of their reliability over a period of time is a way to forecast
   it future behavior, as much as it can be done.

4. Have a MAINTAINERS entry for those jobs, and have maintainers
   attemtp to address issues within a specified amount of time; if
   that fails, have a mechanism to downgrade those jobs to non-gating.
   A patch removing/moving entries from .gitlab-ci*.yml would do that
   and of course sping another set of CI jobs bringing things back to
   green.

I'm fine with that approach if most people agree.  This would mean
point #1 is ignored for now.  For everyone's sake, points #3 and #4
are a must IMO.  Point #2 will applied as we introduced our non-shared
gitlab runners.

The script should indeed work with the workflow you described.  I'll just
run a few tests, to make sure that are no caveats, and I'll let you and
Peter know about it.

Thanks,
