Yes.

Watchpoints are not *really* i/o memory (unless of course it's a watchpoint on
a device, which is a different matter), that's merely how we've chosen to
implement it to force the memory operation through the slow path.  We can, and
probably should, implement this differently wrt probe_write.

Real MMIO can only fault via cc->transaction_failed(), for some sort of bus
error.  Which s390x does not currently implement.  In the meantime, a
probe_write proves that the page is at least mapped correctly, so we have
eliminated the normal access fault.

NOTDIRTY cannot fault at all.  The associated rcu critical section is ugly
enough to make me not want to do anything except continue to go through the
regular MMIO path.

In any case, so long as we eliminate *access* faults by probing the page table,
then falling back to the byte-by-byte loop is, AFAICS, sufficient to implement
the instructions correctly.

Well, if BP_STOP_BEFORE_ACCESS, then we want to raise a debug exception before
any changes are made.  If !BP_STOP_BEFORE_ACCESS, then we longjmp back to the
main cpu loop and single-step the current instruction.

In the latter case, if the instruction has had any side effects prior to the
longjmp, they will be re-done when we re-start the current instruction.

To me this seems like a rather large bug in our implementation of watchpoints,
as it only really works properly for simple load/store/load-op-store type
instructions.  Anything that works on many addresses and doesn't delay side
effects until all accesses are complete will Do The Wrong Thing.

The fix, AFAICS, is for probe_write to call check_watchpoint(), so that we
take the debug exit early.

Heh.  But, seriously, TARGET_PAGE_SIZE bytes is enough at one go, without
releasing control so that interrupts etc may be recognized.
