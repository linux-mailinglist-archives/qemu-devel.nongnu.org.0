That's not accurate, it is not related to IANA service names.

By default the FD name matches the name of the systemd .socket unit
file, but it can be set to an arbitrary string using FileDescriptorName=.
It is upto the application to decide if it wants to require specific
file naming schemes, or is happy to receive the default system .socket
based names.
