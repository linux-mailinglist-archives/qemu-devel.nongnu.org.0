SVE *is* a bit unusual.  In most CPU features they're actually features,
they're on or off, so we have a big list of features that are
enabled/disabled.  We've had that type of thing (at least on x86) for
years and it's OK.
We've got one or two things where they're numerical
(e.g. host-physbits) and we struggle a bit with how to handle them.

SVE is somewhere in between - it's a list of numbers, apparently a
fairly large arbitrarily set of numbers that could be chosen so you'd
need lots of feature flags (sve1...sve64 say or more); so that doesn't
fit the existing things we've had that have worked.
