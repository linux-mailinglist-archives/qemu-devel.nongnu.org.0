I thought it could be a register on the new CPU hotplug controller that
we're going to need anyway (if I understand correctly, at least).

But:

Yes, that should work.

In fact, I had considered 0x58 / 0x59 when looking for unused registers
for extended TSEG configuration:

So I'm OK with this, thank you.

I see.

ICH9_LPC_SMI_F_LOCKED_SMBASE_BIT is 1, with the intended value for
bitmask checkin) being 1LLU<<1 == 2LLU.

Due to the bug, the function would check value 1 in the bitmask -- which
in fact corresponds to bit#0. Bit#0 happens to be
ICH9_LPC_SMI_F_BROADCAST_BIT.

And because OVMF would negotiate that feature (= broadcast SMI) even in
the baseline test, it ended up enabling the "locked smbase" feature too.

So ultimately I think we can consider this a valid test (= with
meaningful result); the result is that we can't reuse these fw_cfg files
for "locked smbase", as discussed above.

Thanks!
Laszlo
