100% agree.

I didn't really understand this, since in state=active we shouldn't
delete anything. Looks OK otherwise.

Yea, that would be very nice to have.

Yep, that the best IMHO.

110% agree (that is not a typo :-) )

Also agree.

I prefer old-secret.

I don't have strong opinion on that. I'll probably would like to keep
this for tests/debugging/etc.

Thank you very much for doing this.

Looks good to me.
