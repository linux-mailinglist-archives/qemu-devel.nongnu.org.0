My gut feeling is that it makes sense to have a more generic option,
with the selinux label specified in the "SocketAddress" QAPI type,
and then have util/qemu-sockets.h be setting the context in
socket_listen().

I don't think this invalidates the patch that Richard proprosed
here, as we'll still need the command line argument he's added.
All that will differ is that the setsockcreatecon_raw will get
moved down.

So from that POV, I don't think we need the general solution to
be a blocker, it can be additive.

Daniel
