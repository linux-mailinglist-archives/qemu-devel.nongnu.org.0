Hi Stefan, I think it's actually not, I would like to have more testing on it, checking all false positive/false negative cases.
I found some issues with it, with false negatives, that I still do not understand.

If anybody wants to rework this taking this as starting point, that's good, otherwise I will get back to it when I can..

I am not sure about the "move the check" part in v2 -> v3, and if anybody has more input and can help to understand this aspect, welcome to collaborate on this.

Ciao,

CLaudio
