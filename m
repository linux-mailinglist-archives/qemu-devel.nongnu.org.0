Ignoring back compat, what would be our ideal CLI syntax ?

Current syntax is

  -chardev socket,id=3Dcharnet1,path=3D/tmp/vhost1.sock
  -netdev vhost-user,chardev=3Dcharnet1,id=3Dhostnet1=20

Should we have an option that expresses a "SocketAddress" struct on the
CLI ?

   -socket type=3Dunix,path=3D/tmp/vhost1.sock,id=3Dsock0
   -netdev vhost-user,socket=3Dsock0,id=3Dhostnet1


IIUC, Marc-Andr=C3=A9 is suggesting that we carry on using -chardev, but
detect when it is a socket chardev, and then ignore chardev APIs and
create a QIOChannel.  I can see some appeal in this as it provides a
way to get all existing usage switched over, but I feel uneasy about
sticking with -chardev forever, if we're not actually using a chardev.

We could do the magic -chardev -> -socket conversion though, for a
short period of time to ease the transition.

We would have to

 1. Introduce the new -socket and add "socket=3D$id" to devices that need i=
t
 2. Deprecate -chardev with type !=3D socket, with no repacement intended
 3. Deprecate -chardev with type =3D=3D socket, translating to -socket
 ...wait 2 releases...
 4. Delete support for "chardev=3D$id" from devices with "socket=3D$id"

The hardest part is probably deciding exactly which set of devices can
be restricted to only sockets, and which must have the full range of
chardev backends available.

Daniel
