Title:
  qemu 5.1.0: Add UNIX socket support for netdev socket

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Note: this is a feature request.

  qemu has a way to connect instances using a socket:

  -netdev socket,id=3Dstr[,fd=3Dh][,listen=3D[host]:port][,connect=3Dhost:p=
ort]

  This can also be used to connect a qemu instance to something else
  using a socket connection, however there is no authentication or
  security to the connection, so rather than using a port which can be
  accessed by any user on the machine, having the ability to use or
  connect to UNIX sockets would be helpful, and adding this option
  should be fairly trivial.

  UNIX sockets can be found in various parts of qemu (monitor, etc) so I
  believe having this on network would make sense.
