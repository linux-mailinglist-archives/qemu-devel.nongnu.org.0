[1] This might have unintended side effects, as it will also call
    cpu_common_reset().  I still think we should try it.

TYPE_CPU points DeviceClass::reset to cpu_common_reset(),
so I believe this affects all TYPE_CPU descendants.

I see 3 separate problems we might want to address:

1) Making device_cold_reset() end up calling CPUClass::reset
   in addition to existing cpu_common_reset()
   (easier to do without side effects).  This would get rid of
   the custom reset callbacks on machine code.

2) Making cpu_reset() call device_cold_reset()
   (will have side effects, needs additional care[1]).
   This would make us have only one method of resetting CPUs.

3) Replacing CPUClass::reset with the new reset mechanisms..
   This would let us get rid of legacy CPU reset code.
