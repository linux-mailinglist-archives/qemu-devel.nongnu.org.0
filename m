Yeah, that would be a good plan.
 git grep '\*[^*]*\*' qapi/*.json
(and eyeball-filtering out the false hits) shows just one use:

qapi/introspect.json:# Note: the QAPI schema is also used to help
define *internal*

I can put a patch on the end which converts that to **internal**
once the rST generator is in use.

No, we can't (see my reply to that review). In theory you could have
the heading syntax be a rST heading, but that is not feasible to
recognise in the Python script[*] and it gives the impression that
it is just an inline rST heading, not something that's more complicated
and structured.

[*] You'd need to manually re-implement the weird thing rST does
where practically any kind of underlining is valid and it figures
out which one means which depth by looking at the usage through
the whole document. You'd have to do bizarre stuff like running
through the entire set of doc comments once doing no output but
just looking at heading underline characters to guess which one
is which depth, and then once you'd figured that out you could
do it all over again actually generating the doc.
