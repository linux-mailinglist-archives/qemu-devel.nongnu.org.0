I think using EM_FOO to tell a plugin about the architecture is just going to
be confusing.  As seen here wrt EM_NANOMIPS, but arguably elsewhere with
EM_SPARC vs EM_SPARC64.

You need to decide what it is that you want the plugin to know.  It is just be
gross architecture?  In which case QEMU_ARCH_FOO is probably enough.  Is it the
instruction set currently executing?  In which case neither EM_FOO nor
QEMU_ARCH_FOO is sufficient -- e.g. arm thumb -- and you'll have to invent
something new, because no two architectures handle this in the same way.  The
closest you might be able to get without invention from whole cloth is the
capstone cap_arch+cap_mode values from cc->disas_set_info().  But that only
handles the most popular of targets.

In any case, a single header that every target must touch is the wrong
approach.  If you want to do some cleanup, move these defines into e.g.
linux-user/$TARGET/target_elf.h.  (And I wouldn't bother touching bsd-user in
its current condition.)
