One thing I thought about is the feasibility of having a callback for
these errors across qapi.  For example you could register a sector for a
read/write/both and when that operation occurs you would block IO, send
the sector number and associated data across qapi for test code to do
something with it and respond allowing the operation to continue
successfully or by returning an error determined by the external test
code to be propagated to guest.

This would allow the logic to be outside of QEMU.  So for example in the
re-write case the test code could remove the error when it gets the
write, instead of having that logic embedded in QEMU itself.

Thoughts?

Also depending on the device type the data behavior can be different
too.  For SCSI devices I believe the specification states that the data
leading up to the sector in error is transferred to the initiator.  For
ATA I believe this is not true.  My code doesn't model this correctly.
I generated the error before any data was transferred.

I'm thinking changes in blkdebug will need to be done to handle this too?

I would think so too.  I'm using error constants that already exist, but
apparently are not being used anywhere else.

I agree, the POC code was experimental, but I should have done more
effort in minimizing the run-time costs.

Additionally I think it would be good if QEMU could standardize the
device wwn format to be consistent throughout all block device types,
eg. uint64_t, but maybe not possible.  I also think it would be good to
allow the wwn passed on the command line correlate with what the guest
sees for /sys/block/<device>/device/wwid.

However, I'm assuming that QEMU has the same stance as the linux kernel
with no visible user space breakage?

This all sounds good to me.  Although I'm not 100% sure of all the
specific details you are describing at the moment as I'm not that
familiar with the code base.

Thanks!
