I don't know much about how this works but maybe it has to match the chip 
or monitor driver to show up? I think on AmigaOS these use 
SiliconMotion502 name instead of the short name.

I get none of these problems on Linux. Maybe it's a problem with WSL? If 
you're on Windows why don't you try a native Windows build? The official 
QEMU download page seems to not have 5.0.0 build yet but there are some 
alternative builds on the emaculation.com forum which should work. For 
AmigaOS use the vanilla 5.0.0 build, ignore the patched screamer sound 
build which is only needed for MacOS on mac99. See:

https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/ppc-osx-on-qemu-for-windows

If you can compile QEMU sources you could try printing 
SM501_DC_PANEL_FB_WIDTH and SM501_DC_PANEL_FB_HEIGHT in 
sm501_disp_ctrl_write() in qemu/hw/display/sm501.c to see what resolution 
the guest programs the card. The high 16 bits are the value to check. 
Haven't tried with adding a mode but with unticking default and setting 
width these remained 1024x768. Your screen shot looks like the window is a 
bit smaller than 1366x768 but it's wide aspect not 4:3 so maybe it did 
change mode but not sure to what size and if that matches your resolution 
(looks like it doesn't that's why you get garbled output).

What you read is for vitual machines created via libvirt and probably 
using other OS than AmigaOS so does not apply to your case. You can add a 
tablet with -device usb-tablet (see -device help for all options) but I 
don't think AmigaOS has a tablet driver so likely it won't work so you can 
ignore that. If the build from emaculation.com did not fix this you may 
try adding -sdl instead to use the SDL graphics backend which works better 
for this, people had problem with the default gtk backend and mouse on the 
emaculation.com forum and recommended using -sdl instead.
