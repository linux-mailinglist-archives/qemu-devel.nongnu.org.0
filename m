Thanks a lot for your comments!

I have just discovered gpiod_to_chip(), which removes the need for two
of the three users ;-)

&aggr->pdev.dev or aggr->dev does't make much of a difference.

strsep(&p, " \"") would terminate the token if a space or double quote is
seen.  I.e. it wouldn't handle spaces in quoted arguments.
There's also argv_split(), but that doesn't handle quoted args, and
duplicates all arguments.

Line names assigned by "gpio-lines-names" may contain spaces, so support
for quoted args is mandatory.

aggr_parse() is called before the platform device is created, and before
aggr->pdev is populated.  So there is no device to print yet.

Same for aggr->pdev.dev (or aggr->dev).

I will just remove the printing of the label, as it is no longer useful.
Since I started using gpiod_lookup, the descriptor has already been
requested at this point, which means its label will usually be
"gpio-aggregator.N", i.e. it doesn't provide any help.
The only exception is for a GPIO line which has an associated line name
through "gpio-line-names" in DT.  But just seeing the global GPIO number
should be good enough for debugging.

BTW, one day you may want to have your our printk() format specifier for
GPIOs?  Oh, no "%pg" and "%pG" are already taken; "%pp" is still
available.

"name" is not the "gpiochipN" name here, but the line name, cfr. the
U16_MAX value for chip index, and the comment just above:

+                       /* Named GPIO line */

That one is supposed to be stable, right?
Note that this is the most use-centric way to refer to a GPIO.

In the other caller:

+                               error = aggr_add_gpio(aggr, name, i, &n);

"name" is a reference to the gpiochip, i.e. either its label, or the
"gpiochipN" name.

Makes sense, but that would be a separate, unrelated patch, right?

OK, so support for "gpiochipN" matching can be dropped, obsoleting
"[PATCH v5 1/5] gpiolib: Add support for gpiochipN-based table lookup".

Note that I added support for that in response to Bartosz' first try
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-gpio/CAMpxmJUF1s1zyXVtoUGfbV7Yk+heua4rNjY=DrX=jr-v8UfNxA@mail.gmail.com/

Consider it done!
Thanks!
