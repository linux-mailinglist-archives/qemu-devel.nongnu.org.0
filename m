Ok, I just walked through various source files (some of which are a bit
confusingly named) again and now I understand again why it was done
that way in the first place.

- hw/s390x/s390-ccw.c provides some interfaces for pass-through ccw
  devices. It is built unconditionally, and its interfaces are called
  unconditionally from the css code.
  It also provides a device class where code can hook up callbacks.
- hw/vfio/ccw.c (which is not built for !KVM) actually hooks up
  callbacks in that device class.

So, s390-ccw.c (not to be confused with ccw-device.c...) provides a
layer that makes it possible to call things unconditionally, regardless
whether we have vfio-ccw available or not. Not that the code ends up
being called without vfio-ccw support; but the class indirection
enables the code to be built.

There's possibly a way to make this work without the class indirection
as well, but I think we'd end up doing code juggling before ending up
with something that's not really nicer than the code we have now.
Therefore, I'd prefer to keep the class handling and hook up the
halt/clear callbacks there as well.
