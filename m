I don't get it.  If what you are saying is true, checking for
kvm_enabled() here is completely unnecessary.  If it is not,
checking for kvm_enabled() here is incorrect.

Masking off the feature if level is < 0x14 would possibly work if
we are 100% sure that existing kernel+QEMU versions crashed when
  (intel-pt=3Don && level < 0x14)
so there's no ABI compatibility with working configurations to
worry about.  But it would be even better to make kvm_put_msrs()
less fragile.  Unexpected CPUID data shouldn't make the function
crash.
