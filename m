Right. The devel/ manual is for things which are purely
QEMU internals -- autogenerated internal API docs,
how TCG works, that kind of thing. (What we have so far
is in docs/devel/.) The interop/ manual is the one for
QEMU's interfaces to other projects.

That tends to be my opinion (especially since we don't for instance
check the text output to make sure it hasn't rendered in some
way that introduces problems). I just wanted to give people
an opportunity to say "I like the way we currently ship plain text".

Yes, if we auto-inline comment text we would need to update
the markup (as with the .hx file stuff I mention later).
(I guess in theory if there's only a very limited set of
markups used we could make the rst generation translate from
the current format to rst, but I think we'd be better off
having the format really match our current documentation.)

Yes, at least in theory. I haven't looked into how difficult
it is to get Sphinx to actually make things refer to each other,
but it really ought to be doable.

Thanks.

Yes, definitely, although this is I think somewhat orthogonal to
the format we use to create them.
