Commit looks good to me, using aio_co_reschedule_self fixes all aborts 
I've been seeing.

I did a quick search for places where a similar pattern is used and 
found 'hw/9pfs/coth.h', where this behavior is already described (though 
the bh seems to be scheduled using the threadpool API, which I'm not 
really familiar with). All other places where qemu_coroutine_yield() is 
preceded by a aio_co_schedule() only do so in the same AioContext, which 
should be safe.
