Public bug reported:

I want to build qemu statically so as to use qemu on Android platform(Thoug=
h Limbo emulator is available on github,it's even slower than qemu in UserL=
And(an Android APP that provides proot container for Linux dists)).
When I finished building qemu normally on my phone(Ubuntu devel in proot en=
vironment),I started to build qemu statically.I removed the old source code=
 dir and unpack the qemu source code. I had built many libraries like libSD=
L2 and libiSCSI for qemu,and of course these libraries were able to be dete=
cted by qemu configure program.But when I ran the command:

 =E2=9D=AF ./configure --static --prefix=3D/home/admin/qemu/build --target-=
list=3Daarch64-softmmu,x86_64-softmmu,i386-softmmu,mips64-softmmu,ppc64-sof=
tmmu --enable-sdl                                                          =
                               ERROR: User requested feature sdl           =
                                            =

configure was not able to find it.                                         =
     =

Install SDL2 devel

I had to give up the SDL feature.
I disabled the SDL feature and ran configure again.The configure didn't rep=
ort error,but besides SDL ,many other libraries like libUSB,libpng were mis=
sing.I ran 'make -j8 &&make install'.All seemed perfect.But when it comes t=
o the final process--linking executables,the ld program went wrong.It said =
it could not find the libraries like -lgtk3 -ldrm -lsystemd,etc.
I was confused.I had already had a test building which successfully finishe=
d.
Could you give me a possible way to solve the problem?

Platform information:
Ubuntu devel 20.04 ARM64 with GCC 9.2.1
QEMU version:I have tested almost all versions from 2.11 to 4.2.0.
