Probably, but we only try to emulate VBlank yet so to avoid any problems 
due to raising irq for unknown bits I restricted it for that now.

Yes, I thought about that but this was only for quick testing. I'll add 
constant for this in next version.

I'd leave these as constants because there are many of them (basically 
reserved bit mask for regs where we care or in this case writable bits) 
and one has to check docs to verify them and also in some cases we combine 
rage128p and rv100 so hiding them behind a constant would just make code 
less readable in my opinion. (This would become 3 lines for example with 
defines you'd have to look up in a different header so it's easier to see 
this way.)

Thanks. Indeed I forgot this. With that it works a bit better, mouse now 
can be moved but only vertically... No idea why, I'll have to check,
