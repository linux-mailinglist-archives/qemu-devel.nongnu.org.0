Good idea. I'll do that in the next round.

OK.

OK.

I was responding to Daniels's earlier comment:

There is certainly very little overhead in that case, since none of the
functions is performance critical.

Well, so far that's two for two for the vtable approach. So unless someone
else agrees with my arguments for pointer patching, that will be my next
iteration of that series :-)
