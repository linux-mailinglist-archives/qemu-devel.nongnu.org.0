I don't profess to understand most of this, I am just a user who found 
something didn't work and tracked down the cause with help from the 
people on the bugtracker.

the min=1 and max=4 was chosen as it seems to be set that way in most 
other places in the source, and 2 fits in that range.

so as macos seems to require 2 bytes but spec says 4 (32 bits) would it 
be better to set min=2 max=4, given that the original revert seems to be 
a security fix?

this works equally well:

static const MemoryRegionOps acpi_pm_tmr_ops = {
     .read = acpi_pm_tmr_read,
     .write = acpi_pm_tmr_write,
     .valid.min_access_size = 2,
     .valid.max_access_size = 4,
     .endianness = DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN,
};

regards.
