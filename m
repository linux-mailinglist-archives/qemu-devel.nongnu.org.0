Libvirt has never produced a qemu command line containing '-snapshot'. =

Part of this is that libvirt wants to control SELinux settings, and =

letting qemu create a temporary overlay in /tmp in order to implement =

-snapshot does not play nicely with libvirt pre-creating all files that =

qemu is allowed to access.

The fact that you were able to manually add -snapshot to your qemu =

command line with older libvirt using -drive (I'm assuming you were also =

not using libvirt's SELinux support, because if you were, qemu would =

have been unable to create/access the temporary wrapper in /tmp), is a =

nice hack.  But since modern qemu has declared -snapshot to be =

unsupported with -blockdev, and modern libvirt has switched to =

-blockdev, I claim that this is not a qemu bug, but a libvirt feature =

request.

That said, libvirt has had a vision for a design for implementing the =

equivalent of -drive -snapshot: the <transient/> sub-element added to =

the domain/disk/source/driver element has been documented for a long time:

https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html
"transient
     If present, this indicates that changes to the device contents =

should be reverted automatically when the guest exits. With some =

hypervisors, marking a disk transient prevents the domain from =

participating in migration or snapshots. Since 0.9.5 "

However, no one has yet implemented it for libvirt's qemu driver.  Part =

of our reluctance has been that we knew that implementing it would =

require libvirt to precreate the wrapper file on every guest start, and =

it is only very recently that we've even had enough functionality in =

libvirt's qemu driver coupled with new qemu commands to create qcow2 =

images using QMP rather than having to shell out to qemu-img.  And part =

of it is that there was no point in implementing something to work with =

-drive, when we knew we had to rework everything for -blockdev anyways. =

But now that the work in libvirt to switch to -blockdev is done, it =

should be a lot easier to implement PROPER support for the <transient/> =

tag, at least for -blockdev usage.

Title:
  [REGRESSION] option `-snapshot` ignored with blockdev

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  After upgrade of qemu 3.1.0 =E2=86=92 4.2.0 I found that running with lib=
virt doesn't honor `-snapshot` option anymore. I.e. disk images get modifie=
d.
  Using `-hda` option honors `-snapshot`

  So I made a test case without libvirt. Testcase using 4.2.0:

  > qemu -hda tmp-16G.img -cdrom regular-rescue-latest-x86_64.iso -m 2G

  This works fine and tmp-16G.img stays unmodified.

  But:
