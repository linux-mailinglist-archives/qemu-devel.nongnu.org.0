So, to make sure I'm clear, you'll be happy with something like:

- no source
$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps -O qcow2 1G
error: --bitmaps requires source file

- src cannot support bitmaps
$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps -f raw -O qcow2 file.raw
error: raw source does not support bitmaps
$ qemu-img measure -f raw -O qcow2 file.raw
success, totals are unchanged (since there are no bitmaps)
$ qemu-img convert --bitmaps -f raw -O qcow2 file.raw file.qcow2
error: raw source does not support bitmaps

- dest cannot support bitmaps
$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O raw file.qcow2
error: raw destination does not support bitmaps
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 -O raw file.qcow2
success, totals are unchanged (since there are no bitmaps)
$ qemu-img convert --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O raw file.qcow2 file.raw
error: raw destination does not support bitmaps

- another way dest cannot support bitmaps
$ qemu-img convert --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -o compat=0.10 \
   src.qcow2 dst.qcow2
error: v2 qcow2 destination does not support bitmaps

- src and dest support bitmaps, but there are none
$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O qcow2 file.qcow2
success, no modification to totals since no bitmaps to copy
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 -O qcow2 file.qcow2
success, separate line item for 'bitmap size: 0'
$ qemu-img convert --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O qcow2 src.qcow2 dst.qcow2
success, even though no bitmaps to copy

- src and dest support bitmaps, and there are some
$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O qcow2 file.qcow2
success, totals modified in place to include bitmaps without separate line
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 -O qcow2 file.qcow2
success, separate line item added for 'bitmap size: NNN'
$ qemu-img convert --bitmaps -f qcow2 -O qcow2 src.qcow2 dst.qcow2
success, and bitmaps were copied

Showing 'bitmaps: 0' in the QMP is how the CLI will know whether it was 
an error to request measuring with bitmaps.

More precisely, fail in QMP if either the source being measured cannot 
support bitmaps at all, or if the destination that determines the 
measurements cannot support bitmaps. But if both support bitmaps, then 
the QMP will output 0 if there happen to be no bitmaps to copy, and the 
CLI can add 'measure --bitmaps' to silently fold in a present bitmaps 
number (be it 0 or non-zero) into the other fields, or error if QMP did 
not include a bitmaps field.

Okay, that is slightly different than what Max was describing (which was 
to output 'bitmaps: 0' in QMP even if the source is raw), but easy 
enough to be consistent on, and as this is your feature request, I can 
make v4 along those lines.

But similarly, with the above rules, 'qemu-img measure --bitmaps' will 
either fail because qemu is too old, or fail because the source format 
cannot support bitmaps to be copied; and succeed if 'qemu-img convert 
--bitmaps' will also succeed.  All without having to check 'qemu-img 
info' to see if there were bitmaps.

Yes, the point of this series is that it is an all-or-none improvement 
to qemu-img: all of the bitmap manipulations you are wanting will be 
included at the same time in qemu 5.1, and likely backported at the same 
time by whatever downstream distros that want backports included. 
Existing qemu-img 5.0 cannot manipulate bitmaps in any reasonable 
manner, at most it has 'qemu-img info' that tells you that bitmaps 
exist, but you're still stuck with a non-qemu-img fallback if there is 
no qemu-img support for manipulating bitmaps at all (including the 
fallback of just declaring incremental backups unsupported, and using 
full backups instead).

2 forms is the easiest way to add it.  And it is not that hard to 
explain.  Either you pass --bitmaps up front (no extra lines, but 
success only if measure saw bitmap support, even if the bitmaps occupy 0 
spze), or you don't pass --bitmaps up front (an extra bitmaps: line if 
bitmaps are supported, even if the size is 0, and no change to existing 
lines).  Just because 2 forms exist does not mean you are required to 
use both forms.

Okay, that's the 2-form approach.
