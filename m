Yes, once a bitmap is read, it's reset.  In your example, after
unpinning z pages the user should still see a bitmap with x+y pages,
but once they've read that bitmap, the next bitmap should be x+y-z.
Userspace can make decisions about when to switch from pre-copy to
stop-and-copy based on convergence, ie. the slope of the line recording
dirty pages per iteration.  The implementation here never allows an
inflection point, dirty pages reported through vfio would always either
be flat or climbing.  There might also be a case that an iommu backed
device could start pinning pages during the course of a migration, how
would the bitmap ever revert from fully populated to only tracking the
pinned pages?  Thanks,

Alex
