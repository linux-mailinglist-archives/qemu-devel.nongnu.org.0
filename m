As this example uses only raw files, it's actually pretty simple:

-blockdev driver=file,filename=nvme0n1.img,node-name=disk1
-blockdev driver=file,filename=nvme0n2.img,node-name=disk2

The -device options stay the same, their drive=... value just refers to
the node-name now. (-drive IDs and node-names have a shared namespace,
so this is unambiguous.)

For the sake of completeness, if nvme0n1.img were actually a qcow2
image, you would add a second -blockdev for the format layer:

-blockdev driver=file,filename=nvme0n1.img,node-name=disk1-file
-blockdev driver=qcow2,file=disk1-file,node-name=disk1
