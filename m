I figure this is a minimally invasive patch to avoid complications in
your rST generator.  I'm afraid it sweeps the actual problem under the
rug, namely flaws in our parsing and representation of doc comments.

The doc comment parser doesn't recognize headings.  Instead, that's done
somewhere in the bowels of the Texinfo generator.  Works as long as the
input is "sane", happily generates invalid Texinfo otherwise, see
tests/qapi-schema/doc-bad-section.json.

The proper fix is to make the parser recognize headers in the places
where headers make sense, and reject them elsewhere.

But maybe we don't have to.  Do you plan to support full rST in doc
comments?  If yes, why have our own syntax for headings?  Why not leave
it to rST?  If no, do you plan to support a subset of rST?  If yes,
define it, please.  How will it be enforced?
