Does this actually matter in the NBD case ?

It has an explicit NBD command for requesting shutdown, and once
that's processed, it is fine to just close the socket abruptly - I
don't see a benefit to a TLS shutdown sequence on top.
AFAIK, the TLS level clean shutdown is only required if the
application protocol does not have any way to determine an
unexpected shutdown itself.

This is relevant for HTTP where the connection data stream may not
have a well defined end condition.

In the NBD case though, we have an explicit NBD_CMD_DISC to trigger
the disconnect. After processing that message, an EOF is acceptable
regardless of whether ,
before processing that message, any EOF is a unexpected.

If the socket has been closed abruptly why would it get stuck in
read() - it should see EOF surely ?
