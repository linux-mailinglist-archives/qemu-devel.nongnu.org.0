Hi Peter,

Thanks for having a look at this.

OK. This means that the register check in check_hcr_el2_trap
will need to extract the register value from the syndrome.
Not a big deal, but maybe slightly less readable.

Ah, very interesting stuff. There is a lot of "magic" happening
in QEMU, and I wondered about the emulated state at some point,
until I forgot about it!

On a vaguely tangential subject, how are conditional instructions
JIT-ed? I could perfectly imagine a conditional VMRS instruction,
but none of the code I looked at seem to care about it. Or is
that done before the access itself is actually emitted?

Noted, thanks.

I'll wait a bit for additional reviews (if any), and then repost the
series with these fixes in.

Thanks,

         M.
