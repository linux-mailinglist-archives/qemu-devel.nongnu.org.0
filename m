Why ? We can just rely on the pcie based uart (virtio-serial-pci or
serial-pci) should be enough.
The only MMIO devices that should be allowed are the ones that can't
be behind pcie.

And AIA patches available in the upstream Linux kernel.
Even after that, can we just remove the PLIC ?
That would mean everybody has to use the latest kernel with AIA
support after that.

Agreed. But It should be disabed by default at first. In the future it
can be removed.
Otherwise, we end up breaking a bunch of user configurations.

I meant no command line configurability options for the machine
itself. We probably should
allow using different versions of the machine via command line.
