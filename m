Yes, on the libvirt side, the functionality that relies on thread_is is
only compiled on Linux. If someone wants to use it on other OS, they'll
have to provide an impl using their platforms equivalent of
sched_setaffinity and friends since none of this stuff is standardized
across OS.

Thread_id should be optional and thus not filled in if we
can't provide a sensible value. Unfortunately we made it
mandatory in QMP.
