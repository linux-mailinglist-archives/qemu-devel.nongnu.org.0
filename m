Another sparse commit message (a recurring theme of this series). The 
subject line says 'what', and the patch appears to be faithful to that, 
but if a future bisection lands here, even a one-sentence 'why' would be 
handy; maybe:

This is part of a larger series of unifying block device relationships 
via child_of_bds.

to at least hint that searching nearby commits gives a better why.

And here's the first point (that I've spotted at least) in this series 
where you are definitely returning a non-BdrvChildRole through a return 
type of BdrvChildRole, rather than me just guessing you might (the 
integer formed by bitwise-or of two enum values is not itself an enum 
value).  Repeating what I said earlier, the C language is loose enough 
to allow your usage, and your usage is somewhat better self-documenting 
than using an unsigned int; but it would not fly in other languages.

So I won't insist you change it, but at least think about it. (And the 
latter has already happened if you read my paragraph - so can we call 
that enough thought on the matter? ;)
