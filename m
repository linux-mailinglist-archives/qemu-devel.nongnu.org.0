I was asked to do this to fix coding style, so that wrapped line,
is 4 characters shifted to the right.

Yes, the .file is the underlying storage for both qcow2 metadata and the data,
and it is unlikely be another qcow2 file. Usually it will be a raw file,
accessed with some protocol.
I will change the wording to not include the 'disk' word though.


To be really honest, the best naming here would be one that follows the virtual memory concepts.
A virtual block/cluster address and a physical block/cluster address.
However we talked with Kevin recently and I also studied quite a lot of qcow2 code,
and the usual convention is guest cluster offset and host cluster offset,
and often guest offsets are just called offsets, which is very confusing IMHO.

Most of block crypto implementations have IV which derive
some way or another from the sector address.

From what I see, the block address is either used as is,
or encrypted itself with same encryption key,
and the result is used as IV. Even the legacy qcow
encryption uses this, although it uses the virtual block
address, and apparently this is one of its security flaws.

If you don't use any IV, you end up with major security
hole - sectors of the same content will be encrypted
to the same cipertext.

I added this comment to clarify the usage of offset,
since other that this aspect of IV generation, 
the crypto routines only need the data to be encrypted and 
the encryption key which is stored in the crypto context.

No no no!

guest_offset is literally the guest's disk address of the first sector that is in the buffer.
The qcow2_co_encrypt is called from 2 places:

1. qcow2_co_pwritev_part - here indeed the actually guest written data
is encrypted, and the 'offset' is passed which is the offset on which pwritev was called


2. do_perform_cow_encrypt - here the just read data from before or after actually written guest
data is encrypted, and the guest_offset represents the address of that data.
I changed the do_perform_cow_encrypt, so that it receives from the caller the host and guest offset
of the data to be encrypted. It then aligns the host offset on start of the cluster, and passes
the guest offset as is, so that it does the same as qcow2_co_pwritev_part.


So what is wrong here?

Crypto code receives the data to be encrypted and decrypted,
and offset of first sector (512 bytes aligned) of that data (for IV calculation).
If the data spans multiple sectors (this happens already a lot) 
then it able to handle this since the code works.
The relevant code is in do_qcrypto_block_cipher_encdec, and
is actually generic for all the crypto modes.

So there should not be anything special about crossing the cluster
boundary, other that noting this here, just in case.

No only that code can cross a cluster boundary, but it can even be
called for more that one cluster at once. It looks like qcow2 code limits all
the IO in case crypto is used to QCOW_MAX_CRYPT_CLUSTERS, which is 32
currently. I don't know why to be honest.

Remember that crypto code has no notion of clusters. It works purely
on sector (512 bytes) level, and each sector will have its own IV calculated,
based on its sector address.
