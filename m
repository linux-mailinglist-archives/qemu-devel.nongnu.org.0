I've adjusted the comment along these lines.

If the host supports vectors, then the .fniv expander will be called.
Otherwise, .fni4 or .fni8 will be used to expand with 32-bit or 64-bit
integers.  Finally, the .fno expander calls an out-of-line helper.

Not strictly kosher perhaps, but in some places we Know that MAX_UNROLL is set
to 4 in tcg/tcg-op-gvec.c, and that since AdvSIMD uses 128-bit vectors, 4 *
32-bit will always be expanded inline, and so omit the out-of-line helper.

I'm not sure why I didn't do this here, since this is not one of the cases in
which we could share helpers with SVE.  (SVE dropped the right-shift as
negative shift count thing.)

It's still used by gen_neon_shift_narrow.
