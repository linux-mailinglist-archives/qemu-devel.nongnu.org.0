I created a minimal example from my setup. I'm running a kernel 4.19.57 wit=
h a custom firmware based on bbl (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk). =

An ioctl device from a kernel module is used to execute the code above in k=
ernel space.
In the example, the userspace application proceeds after a couple of second=
s without receiving the custom IPI.

Title:
  RISC-V unreliable IPIs

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I am working on a project with custom inter processor interrupts (IPIs) o=
n the RISC-V virt machine.
  After upgrading from version 3.1.0 to 4.1.0 which fixes a related issue (=
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu/issues/132) I am able to use the CPU ho=
tplug feature.

  However, if I try to use IPIs for communication between two cores, the
  wfi instruction behaves strangely. Either it does not return, or it
  returns on timer interrupts, even though they are disabled. The code,
  I use on one core to wait for an interrupt is the following.

  	csr_clear(sie, SIE_SEIE | SIE_STIE);
  	do {
  		wait_for_interrupt();
  		sipval =3D csr_read(sip);
  		sieval =3D csr_read(sie);
  		scauseval =3D csr_read(scause) & 0xFF;
  	/* only break if wfi returns for an software interrupt */
  	} while ((sipval & sieval) =3D=3D 0 && scauseval !=3D 1);
  	csr_set(sie, SIE_SEIE | SIE_STIE);

  Since the resulting sequence does not seem to be deterministic, my
  guess is, that it has something to do with the communication of qemu's
  threads for the different cores.
