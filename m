I don't think this is actually downside. If anything I think submodules
I think it would actually let libmuser develop faster.

QEMU is such a large project with high volume patches, that changes
take a long time to merge, even when everything is working well.

I think libmuser would have much faster development velocity if
the bit flowing into qemu.git was only as the trivial submodule
hash updates, as opposed to every single libmuser functional patch.

Maintaining libmuser as a standalone git repo avoids need for
libmuser to tie itself to QEMU's release cycle or processes. In
particular it means libmuser could opt to use a modern development
workflow using a GitForge with merge requests, instead of the
legacy email workflow.

Especially if we're considering libmuser to be consumed by non-QEMU
codebases, then long term it almost certainly should be a standalone
project. With this in mind, I think it will be better for libmuser
to start off as a standalone project straight away, so it can build
up its developer community organically, and not have people put off
contributing by the QEMU firehose.

Daniel
