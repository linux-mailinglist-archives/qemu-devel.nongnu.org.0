But then we cannot have same generated, untouch header file
common for Linux kernel and QEMU. Each uses different defines.
Or at least it was the goal, but after mainline Linux review
we switch in longer run to defines with use of BIT, GENMASK
=46IELD_GET and FIELD_PREP.

But even GENMASK does not seem to be defined in QEMU headers
even that it is referenced in include/hw/usb/dwc2-regs.h
and include/standard-headers/asm-x86/kvm_para.h

So idea to have nice common generated headers which can
be checked for consistency and right version by diff
for Linux kernel, QEMU and even userspace tests
and other OSes (there with Linux defines substitution)
seems to be only dream.

Anyway, we switch to solution which is matching requirements
of each project if it is suggested. But it takes time.

Best wishes,

Pavel
