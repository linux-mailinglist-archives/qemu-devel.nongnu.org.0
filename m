I hooked qcow2_co_pwritev_task and qcow2_co_preadv_task to also write to an external file using your suggestion.

I am seeing very interesting differences with and without the reproducer patch (ie, forcing icount_state_needed to 0 or not):

* without the reproducer patch, everything past the s390-skeys data field is in order: there is the EOS, and then the next idstr follows ("cpu_common").

* with the reproducer patch, every single byte past the s390-skeys data field is ZERO. There is no EOS, there is no next idstr "cpu_common", there is absolutely nothing else than zeroes until the end of the file.

they do not match at all.
