This series should only change device configuration, not device state or
its encoding in the migration stream.

I'm not sure what you mean by "qdev tree ordering problems".  Ist it
commit e8c9e65816 'qom: Make "info qom-tree" show children sorted'?

A question that might avoid a later migration debugging session is
*never* "whatever"!
