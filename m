Sounds good to me.

Perhaps this one can all go into existing block/, similar to how
pr-manager-helper.c is in scsi/, and virtfs-proxy-helper.c is in fsdev/.
Up to the block maintainers, of course.

block/ or nbd/?

Has its own MAINTAINERS section, together with hw/display/edit* and
include/hw/display/edid.h.  I'm not sure moving it hw/display/ is a good
idea.  Gerd?

Not covered by MAINTAINERS.  scripts/get_maintainer.pl --git-blame
points to Gerd.

Yes.

We don't *have* to put each program into its own directory.  Simple ones
could also share one.  We just need a directory name.
