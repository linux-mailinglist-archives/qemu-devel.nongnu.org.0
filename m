These are not defaults, they are "default-1 bits": if a feature is
disabled, these bits are 1 in both halves of the MSR rather than zero.
The set of default-1 bits is documented and is not going to change in
the future.

Some default-1 bits *could* however become features in the future, and
four of these already have features associated to them:
vmx-cr3-load-noexit, vmx-cr3-store-noexit, vmx-exit-nosave-debugctl,
vmx-entry-noload-debugctl.  You can see that they have "no" in their
name because the feature is about the ability to "do less" rather than
"do more".

Because KVM guarantees that this part of the guest ABI will never
change.  These values do not come from the host values of the MSRs, they
are fixed by KVM.  More details below.

These bits are: VMCS revision, VMCS size and VMCS memory type.  QEMU
cannot know them, as they depend on the internal implementation details
of KVM.

Now that KVM supports nested virt live migration they cannot change
anymore---otherwise KVM would break KVM live migration compatibility.
However, theoretically in the future KVM could add some capability
(which userspace would have to manually enable) and when the capability
is enabled the values can change.

The reasoning is more or less the same here.  These bits are part of the
guest ABI (preemption timer scaling, CR3 target count, MSR count, MSEG
revision).  Right now bits 0-4 are 5 and the others are 0; in the future:

- KVM cannot change bits 0-4 and 32-63 them without breaking guest ABI
(the values must match between what you read and what you set)

- KVM could change bits 16-24, but it always allows writing a value that
is _smaller_ than the one you read.  So I'm zeroing those, ensuring no
future ABI changes.

- KVM could in theory change bits 25-27: here it also allows writing a
value that is smaller than the one you read, so guest ABI is preserved.
 Such a change is very unlikely, all Intel silicon has always had 0
here.  But I can change the code to zero these three bits just like bits
16-24.
