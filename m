Yes.

Another yes..

It doesn't necessarily to be during sending a 1GB huge page, the guest can
be using small pages and IMHO we could get stuck at sendmsg() for a precopy
small page while there's actually postcopy requests in the queue.

We can't solve this as long as we keep using 1 single thread for sending
page.

This patchset doesn't solve this issue, yet.  And it's actually the chunk
discussed and mention in the cover letter too in the section "Avoid precopy
write() blocks postcopy" as an TODO item.

Logically in the future we could try to make two or more sender threads so
postcopy pages can use a separate sender thread.

Note that this change will _not_ require interface change either from qemu
cmdline or on migration protocol, because this patchset should have handled
all the migration protocol already even for that, but then if it'll work
well we could get pure speed up on further shrinked latency when preempt
mode enabled comparing to before.

The other thing is I never measured such an effect, so I can't tell how
would it perform at last.  We need more work on top if we'd like to persue
it, mostly on doing proper synchronizations on senders.

Thanks,
