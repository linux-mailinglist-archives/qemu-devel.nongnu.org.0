Nope.  The primary reason is that the HMP interface is bonkers.

Sounds a bit dangerous.  Require a force flag for such an overwrite?
Not sure.

Is it complete then with the current code?  I'm asking because such
properties have a way to sneakily become de facto ABI.  We may not be
able to do anything about that now, other than documenting "don't do
that" like you did, but I'd like to understand the state of affairs all
the same.

Sure we want to these job basics here?

End the sentence with a period, please.

A more useful default could be "if exactly one the block devices being
restored contains a vmstate, use that".

One difference: no "If the job aborts, ..."  Intentional?
