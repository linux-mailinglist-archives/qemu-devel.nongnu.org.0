We need to provide a machine-friendly interface for initial
configuration.

To provide it, we can extend machine-friendly QMP, or make CLI
machine-friendly like QMP.

In both cases, we need to QAPIfy initial configuration.  I believe
that's going to be a big chunk of the work.

To extend QMP, we wrap the QAPIfied initial configuration in QMP
commands.  Many of them will only make sense during initial
configuration.  We'll want to express that in the schema, and enforce it
in the QMP core.

To improve the CLI, we wrap them in CLI options.  We'll want some
infrastructure to generate the boilerplate, just like we generate QMP
command boilerplate.

With an improved CLI, configuration files are just CLI options read from
a file instead of argv[].  We'll want a more suitable concrete syntax
there, of course.

With extended QMP, configuration files are just QMP commands from the
initial configuration subset read from a file instead of a chardev.
Again, we'll likely want more suitable concrete syntax there.

With an improved CLI, I'd expect machines to use configuration files so
they don't have to mess with shell quoting.  With extended QMP, they'd
perhaps rather reuse their existing QMP code to send the configuration
down a socket.  Less efficient, but I doubt it'll matter.

I think we do, for developers and for users who don't need the amazing
infrastructure we built on top of QEMU.  When you use QEMU for
virtualization in production, you generally need it, but there are
other, simpler uses, e.g. certain hardware emulation uses.

A human-friendly CLI can be built both as a wrapper around the
machine-friendly CLI and as a wrapper around the initial configuration
subset of QMP.

Once a machine-friendly replacement for the current CLI is in place, we
can relax the current CLI's compatibility requirements.  I figure we
need this to be able to turn it into a wrapper with reasonable effort.
Hopefully, we can generate much of the wrapping boilerplate.

I don't doubt that many, many users of QEMU are better off consuming it
via libvirt.  I've told a few of them over the years :)

"Not user-facing" only for a particular value of "user".  But your point
is well taken: only the machine-friendly initial configuration interface
needs to be subject to a compatibility promise.

I believe the difference between providing it in QMP and providing it
separately isn't all that great.
