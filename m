I'm not even sure which part of the test is taking so long. Maybe it's
only one of the 88 test functions that's taking long. Or we're
duplicating a lot of tests because we test all combinations of setups
where testing only certain combinations would give enough coverage.

Answering this will probably take some effort checking what the exact
cases tested are and how long each one takes.
