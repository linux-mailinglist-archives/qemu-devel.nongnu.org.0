Ok, I see.

Yes, for the vfio case we can't (unless it is a vgpu).

Otherwise looking up the DisplaySurface (via QemuConsole) and checking
the size should work.  Not a priority given that vfio is probably the
most interesting use case.

How does barrier send input events to physical machines btw?

Makes sense.

Ok.

Depends on how the button id is defined.  If it is one of the usual
keycodes it should be easy and should work better than reverse mapping.
