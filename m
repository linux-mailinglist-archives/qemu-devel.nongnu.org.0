We've still got quite significant testing coverage of i440fx and outside
of PCI-Express much logic is shared with q35. Right now at least i440fx
feels mature and stable, while q35 is still showing significant
instability with PCI-Express and hotplug in particular. I'd hoppe at
least the combination of maturity of our plain PCI code and testing
coverage would address risk of significant regressions in i440fx even
when attention is on q35.

The difference is that people would opt-in to usage of the new system
binaries. So existing users, scripts and documentation won't be impacted
unless they decide to switch - at least as long as we keep the old
system emulators around. If did eventually decide to remove the old
binaries, then there would be disruption but that's more of a clean
break with the past.
