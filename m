That'd be great, thank you.

TID2 is only a nice to have (it allows us to virtualize the cache
hierarchy, only a performance optimization for fairly stupid 32bit
guests), and TID1 is so far unused by Linux.

I also had a look at TID0, but couldn't find any of the Jazelle
stuff in QEMU...

Ah! I guess you're referring to the HELPER() stuff in the various
target/arm/*_helper.c files? If so, I think I see how to do it.

Thanks,
