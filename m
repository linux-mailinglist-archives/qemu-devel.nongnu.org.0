Jon,

I've finished my review and things are looking pretty good. The code is
a good clean-up and makes adding new features a lot easier. Thanks for
the examples of extensions - they were worth it to see how this might be
used although we shouldn't include them in the first merge. As they
extend the gdbserver ABI we'll want to think carefully about exactly
what we want to expose before we include it in master.

Going forwards aside from the various comments on each patch it would be
worth making sure the branch has gone through at least one CI run to
make sure the non-x86 builds (and disable-tcg and other exotica) haven't
been broken.

It would be nice if we could extend the testing of the gdbserver. Have
you been testing this with the gdb test suite or just manually? Now we
have system test and linux-user binaries being built we could probably
do better than the manually run tests/guest-debug/test-gdbstub.py.

Finally it would be nice if we could modernise the membuf and strbuf
handling with a more robust glib based approach. I understand if you
don't want to do that now and I'll happily accept the patches without it
but I did notice you can send the gdbserver a bit loopy if you send it
some very long maint packets so it would be nice to have that a bit
safer.
