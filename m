>=20

It does have tab completion for command names, but it does not know
about or remember argument fields. It does not have autocomplete or
typing hints like FiSH or bash ^r.

I would like to change this, actually, by making the docstrings in QAPI
schema a first class citizen of the spec and allowing them to be
introspectable via the socket directly.

(I.e., you can get the list of arguments and the docstrings that
accompany them over the wire so you can display it in the client.)

Problem I'm having with qmp-shell is, like Kevin says below ...

>=20

... I can't figure out how to make writing commands simple.

When you have a "simple" command, the abstraction works OK; you can type
key=3Dval pairs and go about your way.

As soon as you have anything nested, the gossamer-thin illusion is
destroyed. I investigated making this a little easier by adding a parser
that could read directly from stdin and would allow multi-line JSON
inputs as arguments.

(Like the python shell does it, for example: When you have a dictionary
opening brace, it lets you continue to the next line.)

I was a little disheartened that most JSON parsers in python expect to
consume buffered objects and generally consume the entire buffer -- it
didn't seem to play nice with the idea of wanting to parse from STDIN
directly.


So:

- I think qmp-shell is worth having, especially if polished
(autocomplete, docstrings, argument hints, etc).

- Kevin mentioned getting this into the GTK shell. I think that would be
great, as a step to help phase out HMP.

- I think getting rid of HMP is good because I don't care for the idea
of supporting two monitor protocols. One schema, one parser, one truth.

- I do, however, like the idea of having a non-rigorous monitor that
lets us get away with murder when we need to. HMP is useful for
debugging, prototypes and other things where the rigor and permanence of
a QAPI schema feels too burdensome.

- So: maybe a turbocharged qmp-shell can offer some similar kinds of
convenience commands that are build on top of real QMP. Sugar logic and
other fanciful things could be implemented there in qmp-shell as
extensions. You'd get a stock pile of them with your QEMU install that
help you do certain tasks quickly and trivially.

- Given all the above, I am willing to try to save, polish, or re-design
qmp-shell; but am a bit starved for ideas on the syntax... This is why I
was spending a bit of time talking about our flattening to dot syntax,
and other projects related to representing hierarchical data.

Would really love to hear ideas on what a good interactive shell syntax
for a JSON-fueled schema would look like.

Any prior art, other projects, and reading anyone can recommend would be
nice.

This is why I have two things I want to do:

Part A:
- Remove the CLI as it exists today*
- Introduce a machine-readable, but human-friendly format, like YAML (or
JSON) that's based directly on QAPI.

Part B:
- Improve qmp-shell such that it provides a sufficient usability layer
on top of QMP
- Make this tool prominent to users; e.g. putting it in the GTK
interface would be nice.
- Reduce prominence of HMP and works towards its removal.
