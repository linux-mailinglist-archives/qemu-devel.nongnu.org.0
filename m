From: Alberto Garcia <berto@igalia.com>

bdrv_unref_child() does the following things:

  - Updates the child->bs->inherits_from pointer.
  - Calls bdrv_detach_child() to remove the BdrvChild from bs->children.
  - Calls bdrv_unref() to unref the child BlockDriverState.

When bdrv_unref_child() was introduced in commit 33a604075c it was not
used in bdrv_close() because the drivers that had additional children
(like quorum or blkverify) had already called bdrv_unref() on their
children during their own close functions.

This was changed later (in 0bd6e91a7e for quorum, in 3e586be0b2 for
blkverify) so there's no reason not to use bdrv_unref_child() in
bdrv_close() anymore.

After this there's also no need to remove bs->backing and bs->file
separately from the rest of the children, so bdrv_close() can be
simplified.

Now bdrv_close() unrefs all children (before this patch it was only
bs->file and bs->backing). As a result, none of the callers of
brvd_attach_child() should remove their reference to child_bs (because
this function effectively steals that reference). This patch updates a
couple of tests that were doing their own bdrv_unref().
