I tried with a guest XML matching yours (other than disk setup).
I didn't get those errors you reported even when using your config.


Notable differences to my default - your guest has:
- a rather old chip type (Penryn is a 2007 chip)
- a rather old machine type (uses xenial which matches ~pc-i440fx-2.5)
This probably based on when the system was created.
But since you also have the same issues on the windows guest which has the =
modern:
  <type arch=3D'x86_64' machine=3D'pc-q35-4.2'>hvm</type>
  <cpu mode=3D'host-model' check=3D'partial'/>
So this isn't a route we need to go down...


Note: I tried this on kernel 5.4.0-14-generic with some common not too old =
& not too new chips
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620
- AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 4226

Then I remembered that you followed to disable nesting and after all
vmx-* you see in the warnings could be related.

I ran this and restarted my guests:
# sudo rmmod kvm_intel
# sudo modprobe kvm_intel nested=3D0
or
# sudo rmmod kvm_amd
# sudo modprobe kvm_amd nested=3D0

Even then I didn't get the same warnings or crashes you got.

FYI: maybe related (similar symptom - which could be anything as we
know, but still worth a link):

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
