That is bizarre

   Pulling docker image registry.gitlab.com/qemu-project/[MASKED]/fedora:latest ...

I've not seen any other gitlab project where the paths are 'MASKED' in
this way. Makes me wonder if there's some setting in the QEMU gitlab
project causing this, as its certainly not expected behaviour.

Grabbing the container URL from line 8 of the build log is my
standard goto approach.

Note, $QEMU_CONFIGURE_OPTS is set by the container image itself, so
there's no need to know that one.

$CONFIGURE_ARGS meanwhile is set in the build-XXXXX template and
easy to find.

You shouldn't need to understand that to reproduce problems.

At most just need to find the $CONFIGURE_ARGS and $MAKE_CHECK_ARGS
settings for the build-XXX job at hand.

Running the containers directly in docker/podman is how I reproduce
pretty much everything locally, and its been pretty straightforward
IME.
