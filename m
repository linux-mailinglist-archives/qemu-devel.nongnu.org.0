There is a single review comment that wasn't addressed which is 
replacing an enum with a comment. And I explicitly mentioned that it's 
because I want additional opinion on this.
I don't see why such a small thing should block review for 15 patches...
All the rest of the comments (Which were great) have been addressed. 
Unless I have mistakenly missed something, which please point it out if 
I did.

That's not what I tried to do. I carefully fixed all comments I saw in 
the review discussion and run tests.
The only thing which wasn't addressed is removing an enum and replacing 
it with a comment.
The hint that I try to manipulate maintainers is disrespectful. I assume 
that this isn't your intention, as we all just want to collaborate 
together here. No need to make this a personal discussion.

If you think that replacing the enum with a comment is a blocker for v2 
patch-series, I will go ahead and submit v3 with that change.
Is there any other comment you made on v1 patch-series you think I missed?
