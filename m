The aim here was to be forwards compatible while fitting within the
existing ABI.

The ABI doesn't allow variable-sized registers, and if the vq can
someday grow above 16 then the individual registers could become pretty
big.

Inside the kernel, we took the view that if that ever happens, it's
sufficiently far out that we can skip implementing the support today,
providing that the ABI can accommodate the change.

For qemu, if you don't actually care what's in the regs, you could just
enumerate then using KVM_GET_REG_LIST instead of manufacturing the IDs
by hand.  That way, you don't have to care what slices exist.  For
save/restore/migrate purposes, the regs are just data, so that's
probably enough.

Debug, and exchanging vector registers between the guest and, say, and
SMC trapped to userspace, would still need to examine specific regs.
I don't know what QEMU does in this area though.

It's for QEMU to choose, but does it actually matter what byteorder you
store a Z-reg or P-reg in?  Maybe the byteswap isn't really needed.

I don't know how this works when migrating from a little-endian to a
big-endian host or vice-versa (or if that is even supported...)
