Good point.  Will rework it to avoid this matching.  Basically we can
put the values we
read directly into the config dictionary in one step.

Makes sense.  We will change it to validate in one place just before
we expect to use this data.

The example we provided was primarily for aarch64, we will add one or
more examples here for the other VMs to
help provide a ready to use template for providing a config file.

All interesting questions to explore.  Here is my take on this.

One goal we had in mind is to not require a config file for any given
VM.  So in this sense we are
not going in the direction of a config driven approach.
Even the VMs that we added for aarch64 do not require a config file.
The VM scripts will work as is without a config file since the script
itself provides all required defaults.
Our intention was for the config approach to be used to allow
overriding the defaults for any
given VM, to give the flexibility of overriding the parameters.
But on the other hand by not requiring a config file, we make is
simpler and easier to
only override the parameters that the user is interested in.  And also
to limit the cases where
we could generate a non-working VM if the user forgot to provide
certain defaults.

Thanks & Regards,
-Rob
