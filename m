Make it more obvious how to add new fields to the version 3 header and
how to interpret them.

The specification is adjusted so for new defined optional fields:

1. Software may support some of these optional fields and ignore the
   others, which means that features may be backported to downstream
   Qemu independently.
2. If we want to add incompatible field (or a field, for which some its
   values would be incompatible), it must be accompanied by
   incompatible feature bit.

Also the concept of "default is zero" is clarified, as it's strange to
say that the value of the field is assumed to be zero for the software
version which don't know about the field at all and don't know how to
treat it be it zero or not.

+=== Additional fields (version 3 and higher) ===
+
+In general, these fields are optional and may be safely ignored by the software,
+as well as filled by zeros (which is equal to field absence), if software needs
+to set field B, but does not care about field A, which precedes B. More
+formally, additional fields have the following compatibility rules:
+
+1. If the value of the additional field must not be ignored for correct
+handling of the file, it will be accompanied by a corresponding incompatible
+feature bit.
+
+2. If there are no unrecognized incompatible feature bits set, an unknown
+additional field may be safely ignored other than preserving its value when
+rewriting the image header.
+
+3. An explicit value of 0 will have the same behavior as when the field is not
+present*, if not altered by a specific incompatible bit.
+
+*. A field is considered not present when header_length is less or equal to the
+field's offset. Also, all additional fields are not present for version 2.

+
+
+=== Header padding ===
+
+@header_length must be a multiple of 8, which means that if the end of the last
+additional field is not aligned, some padding is needed. This padding must be
+zeroed, so that, if some existing (or future) additional field will fall into
+the padding, it will be interpreted accordingly to point [3.] of the previous
+paragraph, i.e.  in the same manner as when this field is not present.
+
+
+=== Header extensions ===
 
 Directly after the image header, optional sections called header extensions can
 be stored. Each extension has a structure like the following:
