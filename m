I understand your need but this is still arguable. The 9p device has
a limitation with cross-device setups. The actual bug is to silently
cause inode number collisions in the guest. This is partly fixed by the
"9p: Treat multiple devices on one export as an error" patch. Thinking
again, it would even make sense to move "remap" from "9p: Added virtfs
option 'multidevs=remap|forbid|warn'" to its own patch. We could then
consider that the bug is fully fixed with "multidevs=forbid|warn".

Then comes the "remap" feature which is expected to lift the limitation
with cross-device setups, with a "not yet determined" performance cost
and light reviewing of the code.

Not really. This gives a crucial information to the user about the
level of confidence we have in this feature.

The overwhelming majority of feedbacks I had on 9p the last few years
are CVEs. Antonios and you are the only users who ever seemed to care
for cross-device setups. So I don't expect much feedback on that area
and I don't buy the "motivate people" argument, especially since "remap"
won't be the default.

Yes and before a feature has a chance to be officially supported
in libvirt, people usually rely on the <qemu:commandline> domain
XML tag to pass extra arguments to QEMU.

https://blog.vmsplice.net/2011/04/how-to-pass-qemu-command-line-options.html

With the current fsdev implementation, we can only pass properties
to the -fsdev command line option. So this would require to not
use the <filesystem type='mount'> XML tag and manually _open-code_
the needed QEMU arguments:

<qemu:commandline>
  <qemu:arg value='-fsdev'/>
  <qemu:arg value='local,id=fsdev0,path=/var/tmp/virtfs,security_model=passthrough,multidevs=remap'/>
  <qemu:arg value='-device'/>
  <qemu:arg value='virtio-9p,id=virtio-9p0,mount_tag=host,fsdev=fsdev0'/>
</qemu:commandline>

And if fsdev is converted to be a proper QEMU device, it would as
easy as:

<qemu:commandline>
  <qemu:arg value='-set'/>
  <qemu:arg value='device.fsdev0.multidevs=remap'/>
</qemu:commandline>

This is unrelated but it would also allow to drop a lot
of code in fsdev that mimics what qdev would give us
for free. :)

Also, I strongly recommend you try out "virtio-fs" which is
going to be soon the production grade way of sharing files
between host and guest.
