Do we actually need/want it to be in the same monolithic repo
as qemu, as opposed to a qemu-qapi-rust repo ?

Trying to weld together different build systems is never that
attractive. The language specific build systems generally are
much simpler if they're self contained. From a distro POV it
can be better if the language bindings are self contained, as
you don't neccessarily want to build the language binding in
the same environment as the main app. For example with modules
in Fedora or RHEL, there can be multiple parallel versions of
a language runtime, and thus language bindings would be built
separately from QEMU.

IIUC, you're generating stuff from the QEMU schemas. One way
we can deal with this is to actually install the QEMU schemas
into /usr/share. Distros would have an "qemu-devel" package
that provided the schemas and the QAPI base tools which
can then be used by separate bindings.

Daniel
