Of course, this could be modeled with via virtio_pci_cap as well. Would 
add 12 unused by bytes and one type byte. If it helps to make the device 
look more virtio'ish, but I'm afraid there are more differences at PCI 
level.

I do not see a use case for having multiple of those caps above per 
device. If someone comes around with a valid use case for having 
multiple, non-consequitive shared memory regions for one device, we 
would need to add registers for them. But that would also only work for 
non-BAR regions due to limited BARs.

What would be the practical benefit? Do you see PCIe caps that could 
become useful in virtual setups? We don't do that for regular virtio 
devices either, do we?

Thanks,
Jan
