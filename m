Yeh I realised it was getting a bit arcane.

It's not actually that flexible; it can only prepend a prefix;
conditionally on a given prefix, i.e.

   s/^OLD/NEWOLD/

it can't do a generic rewrite.  It's precisely the inverse of (4).

It can explicitly allow server xattrs.

What we have is 
(client, server, all) x ([un-]prefix , good, bad)

OK; so the 'server' being the one with the underlying fs from which a
capability is read.

I didn't bother adding any escaping code; do you think we need to
bother? I've not seen any use of an xattr pattern that uses a :  - if
I was going to suggest an easiest thing I think I'd do it like 'sed'
in making the first character be the matching character rather than
explicitly :.

The point of 'o' and 'b' is to terminate immediately; the idea is to be
able to do something like:

    'trusted.chocolate' -> OK
    'trusted.cheese' -> BAD
    'trusted' -> prefix by user.virtiofs

so that the trusted.something is accepted and stops processing, and then
any other trusted's get prefixed.

Any match terminates; so a 'p' prefixes and that's it - no other command
is processed.

I'll rework so that:
  a) I replace any single letters by an explicit name
  b) I use 'server' instead of host'
