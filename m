The main other user is 9pfs, then there is:

hw/remote/message.c
io/channel.c
job.c
migration/savevm.c
monitor/hmp-cmds.c
monitor/monitor-internal.h
monitor/qmp.c
nbd/client-connection.c

Yes, it's a large amount of code, but it's relatively self-contained. 
In io/ for example only three functions would have to become C++ 
(qio_channel_readv_full_all_eof, qio_channel_writev_full_all, 
qio_channel_yield), and it's easy to move them to a separate file 
io/channel-coroutine.cc.

Likewise for e.g. util/async.c or util/thread-pool.c (one function each).

The block layer would almost entirely move to C++, that's for sure.  The 
monitor would be a bit more in the middle, but hardware emulation can 
remain 100% C.

I haven't gotten the thing to compile or run yet, and I'm not sure how 
much time I'll have this week, but the change for test-coroutine.c to 
run should be in the ballpark of this:

  include/qemu/coroutine.h                                 |  26
  tests/unit/meson.build                                   |   6
  tests/unit/{test-coroutine.c => test-coroutine.cc}       | 106
  util/meson.build                                         |   4
  util/{qemu-coroutine-lock.c => qemu-coroutine-lock.cc}   |  65
  util/{qemu-coroutine-sleep.c => qemu-coroutine-sleep.cc} |  10

where the changes are for a good part mechanical: switching from "x 
coroutine_fn" to CoroutineFn<x> entirely so, while adding co_await in 
front of coroutine calls is half mechanical.  For non-void functions, 
the compiler can identify all callers (because the old type "int" is not 
compatible with the new type CoroutineFn<int>).  For void function one 
could use warn_unused_result.

The question is what is easier to maintain, stack switching code that is 
becoming less and less portable (status quo with SafeStack, CET and the 
TLS issues that Stefan has worked on), a mixed C/C++ codebase (C++ 
coroutines), a custom source-to-source translator (this series).  The 
third might be more fun, but it would be quite a large enterprise and 
the C++ compiler writers have already done the work.

A part of the changes is common in both cases, since you cannot have 
code that can run both inside or outside a coroutine.

Paolo
