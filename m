This patchset converts the SPARC target away from the old
broken do_unassigned_access hook to the new (added in 2017...)
do_transaction_failed hook. In the process it fixes a number
of bugs in corner cases.

The SPARC ld/st-with-ASI helper functions are odd in that they
make use of the cpu_unassigned_access() function as a way of
raising an MMU fault. We start by making them just directly
call a new sparc_raise_mmu_fault() function so they don't go
through the hook function. This in-passing fixes a bug where
the hook was using GETPC(), which won't work inside a function
several levels deep in the callstack from a helper function.

The next four patches convert places that were using ld*_phys()
and st*_phys() and thus getting "implicitly causes an exception
via do_unassigned_access if it gets a bus error" behaviour.
We make them all use address_space_ld*/st* functions instead,
and explicitly handle the transaction-failure case. Variously:
 * for MMU passthrough, this doesn't change behaviour
 * for the MXCC stream source/destination ASI accesses,
   this doesn't change behaviour, but the current behaviour
   looks a bit weird, so a TODO comment is left in case anybody
   wants to chase up the actual right behaviour in future
 * for page table walks this fixes a bug where we would take
   an exception instead of reporting the page table walk failure
   with the correct fault status register information
 * for the page table walk in mmu_probe() this fixes a bug where
   we would take an exception when we are supposed to just report
   failure. Note that the spec says that MMU probe operations
   are supposed to set the fault status registers, but we do not;
   again I leave this pre-existing bug as a TODO note.
Next, we remove one entirely pointless and unused ldl_phys()
call from dump_mmu().

Finally, the last patch can do the very small amount of work to
change over to the new hook function. This will cause all the
"handle error" code paths in the preceding patches to become
active (when a do_unassigned_access hook is present the load
or store functions will never return an error, because the hook
will get called and throw an exception first).

I have tested that I can boot a sparc32 debian image, and
that sparc64 boots up to the firmware prompt, but this could
certainly use more extensive testing than I have given it.

(After SPARC, the only remaining unassigned-access-hook users
are RISCV, which crept in while I wasn't looking, and MIPS,
which is doing something complicated with the Jazz board that
I haven't yet investigated.)

thanks
