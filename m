Seems reasonable, if an incompatible device can crash the whole guest.
Better not even let it start. (And prevent hotplugging it into a
running guest.)

Yes, if that is not architected, and no other possible failure code can
map to that case.

Which devices are compatible in the end? It seems the only ones that
are known to be working are virtio-ccw devices with IOMMU_PLATFORM on.
virtio-pci devices and non-virtio ccw (vfio-ccw, 3270) seem to be out,
as far as I understand it. What about non-ccw? PCI in general, vfio-ap?
