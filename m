Hi Christian,

I have certainly not forgotten but I had (and still have) some more urgent
work to do and I couldn't find time for this... Sorry :)

Thinking again about the initial issue raised by Antonios, I agree we
should at least detect collisions in the existing 9pfs code and
emit an error rather than silently returning duplicate QIDs to the
client. This would be patch 2 from Antonios's series: only allow
a single host device for a given fs device.

Then, we come to the bulk problem: how to handle the case where we
have multiple devices involved in a directory we want to share ?
Antonios's proposal is a clever way to address the collisions, but
your work proves it isn't enough... Before going forward, I'd like
to consider another approach.

What about:

1) de-compose the shared directory on a per-device basis,
   ie. identify all mount points under the shared directory

2) expose found mount points separately, each with its onw 9p device

3) re-compose the directory tree within the guest using the same topology
   as the host

ie. if you want to share /vm/fs and

/vm/fs on device A
/vm/fs/shares on device B
/vm/fs/tmp on device C

you would start QEMU with

-fsdev local,path=/vm/fs,id=fsdev0... \
-device virtio-9p,fsdev=fsdev0,mount_tag=tag0 \
-fsdev local,path=/vm/fs,id=fsdev1... \
-device virtio-9p,fsdev=fsdev1,mount_tag=tag1 \
-fsdev local,path=/vm/fs,id=fsdev2... \
-device virtio-9p,fsdev=fsdev2,mount_tag=tag2

and /etc/fstab in the guest:

tag0    /       9p      nofail,trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L   0 0
tag1    /shares 9p      nofail,trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L   0 0
tag2    /tmp    9p      nofail,trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L   0 0

This involves some more work for the user but it doesn't require
any changes in QEMU.

Would this approach solve the issues you've been hitting with Samba ?

Cheers,
