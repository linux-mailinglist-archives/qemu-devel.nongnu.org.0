In x86 case, there is RTC value and there is memory map provided via
paravirt fwcfg.

Using register is fine for passing total RAM size and
Since it's QEMU invention, we could pass full 4Gb in register as
a starting point to support 4Gb of RAM (which removes fixup) and
let SeaBIOS to deduce memory map from that.

Then this patch cloud be amended to:
"
hpp: support 4G of RAM

Real hardware allows to plug in up to 4Gb of RAM
into memory slots, add support for this.

It describes what exactly patch does without masking any
consequences of used approach (since we are not really telling
guest that it has more RAM and guest has other means to discover
it).

If you are asking why I'm making it hard error, see cover letter.
(in short main RAM allocation is total mess and series fixes
that by consolidating, de-duplicating and replacing ad hoc allocation
with a centralized approach that allows user to specify used
RAM backend in generic case).

it's ram_addr_t, which is mutable depending on the host
it could be 32-bit or 64-bit.

Currently QEMU doesn't have a generic code to do such
checks and QEMU accumulated a whole zoo where some boards
do checks, some mask incorrect -m values and some do don't
do any checks. But cleaning up that is out of scope of
this already big enough re-factoring.
Hence I'm adding checks/removing fixups where they were
missing/present as it's a minimum effort needed to generalize
main RAM allocation.

> So, I'd suggest to drop your wrong patch #43.
As you noted in your first reply, patch is correct.
All it's doing is validating user input versus RAM size
actually supported by the current code, telling user
current supported limit and enforcing it.

I agree it's inconvenience for the users since they
won't be able to specify non-sense values and still
get board running, but that's clear user error and
should be corrected on user side and not by QEMU
magically masking wrong CLI values.
Since it could be fixed on user side, I care less
about user convenience when it comes to correctness
and unified code.

I have to disagree on definition of wrong here,
in my opinion covering up user errors is wrong especially
when all users have to do is to adapt their CLI.

Supporting 4Gb is another story, which is extending current
impl. and could be done on top of the ram_size check.
