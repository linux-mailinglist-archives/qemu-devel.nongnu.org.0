Hi,

This seems to have died out. How do we proceed to get this looked into
by the correct people?

Thanks,
Damir

Title:
  Unstable Win10 guest with qemu 3.1 + huge pages + hv_stimer

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Host:
  Gentoo linux x86_64, kernel 4.20.1
  Qemu 3.1.0 =

  CPU: Intel i7 6850K
  Chipset: X99

  Guest:
  Windows 10 Pro 64bit (1809)
  Machine type: pc-q35_3.1
  Hyper-V enlightenments: hv_stimer,hv_reenlightenment,hv_frequencies,hv_va=
pic,hv_reset,hv_synic,hv_runtime,hv_vpindex,hv_time,hv_relaxed,hv_spinlocks=
=3D0x1fff
  Memory: 16GB backed by 2MB huge pages

  Issue:
  Once guest is started, log gets flooded with:

  qemu-system-x86_64: vhost_region_add_section: Overlapping but not
  coherent sections at 103000

  or

  qemu-system-x86_64: vhost_region_add_section:Section rounded to 0
  prior to previous 1f000

  (line endings change)

  and as time goes guest loses network access (virtio-net-pci) and
  general performance diminishes to extent of freezing applications.

  Observations:
  1) problem disappears when hv_stimer is removed
  2) problem disappears when memory backing with huge pages is disabled
  3) problem disappears when machine type is downgraded to pc-q35_3.0
