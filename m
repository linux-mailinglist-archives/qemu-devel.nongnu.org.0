Yeah, I feel like it was a mistake for us to wire up many of our features
to chardevs. We mostly did it because -chardev provides a pre-existing
syntax for TCP/UNIX sockets and we didn't want to invent new CLI args.
IMHO this was a mistake in retrospect.

Unfortunately the -chardev API is absolutely terrible for any usage that
actually cares about the connection based semantics. Witness the horrible
hacks we do for re-connect and re-try when failing to initially connect
in vhost-user net code.

For features in QEMU where the only desirable chardev backend is one with
connection based, socket semantics, I think we would be better off using
the QIOChannel APIs directly and completely avoiding the chardev code.
