In patch 15 (implementing things in qcow2), I actually wrote the driver=20
to return live results, rather than just open-time results, in part=20
because writing the bit to persistent storage in qcow2 means that the=20
bit must be accurate, without relying on the block layer's help.

But my pending NBD patch (not posted yet, but will be soon), the=20
proposal I'm making for the NBD protocol itself is just open-time, not=20
live, and so it would be more work than necessary to make the NBD driver=20
report live results.

But it seems like it should be easy enough to also patch the block layer=20
itself to guarantee that callers of bdrv_known_zeroes() cannot see this=20
bit set if the block layer has been used in any non-zero transaction, by=20
repeating the same logic as used in qcow2 to kill the bit (any=20
write/write_compressed/bdrv_copy clear the bit, any trim clears the bit=20
if the driver does not guarantee trim reads as zero, any truncate clears=20
the bit if the driver does not guarantee truncate reads as zero, etc).=20
Basically, the block layer would cache the results of .bdrv_known_zeroes=20
during .bdrv_co_open, bdrv_co_pwrite() and friends would update that=20
cache, and and bdrv_known_zeroes() would report the cached value rather=20
than a fresh call to .bdrv_known_zeroes.

Are we worried enough about clients of this interface to make the block=20
layer more robust?  (From the maintenance standpoint, the more the block=20
layer guarantees, the easier it is to write code that uses the block=20
layer; but there is the counter-argument that making the block layer=20
track whether an image has been modified means a [slight] penalty to=20
every write request to update the boolean.)
