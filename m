The default is indeed defined as 6. As it was before this patch.
There is not much to explain besides the fact that recent VMware 
products returns 6 here.

I don't recall any mapping between the returned version here and the 
supported set of VMPort commands. There is a separate mechanism (which 
we implement in another patch) to signal that a command is unsupported / 
failed.

The term "vmx-version" refers to the version of the Userspace-VMM of 
VMware which is called (confusingly) "vmx".

I will need to dig in production history to find it... They are usually 
proprietary appliances specially made to run as VMware VMs.

In all those cases, we have taken the version number backwards, not forward.

Most users will indeed not need to touch this. This is for advanced 
users, such as Ravello.
We usually figured this out by reverse-engineering the failed guest 
and/or examining the original VMware environment it used to run on.
