The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Mouse moves erratically when using scroll wheel on Windows NT 4,
  Windows 95, and Windows 3.1 guests

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  QEMU version: 3.0.0 RC3
  Guests: Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, Windows 3.1

  Program: When the user uses the scroll wheel, the mouse's movement
  becomes erratic.

  This is noticed immediately when the scroll wheel is used. Sometimes
  the problem can be fixed by moving the scroll wheel some more.

  My theory is this problem is because of the lack of support for the
  Microsoft Intellimouse in these guest operating systems.
