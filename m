Hi,

I want to run u-boot for x86_64 architecture in windows10 and I am using
qemu-5.0.0, the latest version of qemu. The TAP adapter for Linux (host)
worked successfully and I communicated between u-boot (guest) and Linux
(host), but the result for Windows (host) failed.

I installed the Tap Network Adapter for windows and renamed it to "tap0" . =
when I ran the qemu with the following command without creating a bridge, u=
-boot was successfully initialized, but I cannot ping Windows (host).
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -bios u-boot.rom -nographic -device  e1000,netdev=3D=
mynet0 -netdev tap,id=3Dmynet0,ifname=3Dtap0

When I check (right click> status) for Tap0 it says No Network Connection.
I terminated qemu and connected tap0 to the internet using the config files=
 I downloaded for OpenVPN.
When I checked tap0 again, I saw "Ipv4: Internet" but when I try to run qem=
u this way, I get an error like this.

tap: Could not open 'tap0'
qemu-system-x86_64.exe: Device 'tap' could not be initialized

Title:
  tap connections not working on windows host

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  using latest qemu 2.2.0 64bit for windows host (installed from
  qemu-w64-setup-20141210.exe obtained from http://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/
  ),OpenVPN 2.6.3-I601 64bit tap adapter named tap01 and calling qemu
  using the following.

  qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -net nic -net tap,ifname=3Dtap01 -hda
  "c:\\data\\images\\test.img"

  where the image contains a slackware 14.0 64bit install.
  The tap is bridged with the real network adapter and the bridge is given =
an ip of 10.1.1.41 (which works as the ip for the windows host). The tap ad=
apter (in network connections) shows connected when the qemu vm is running.=
 inside the vm, the network is given an ip of 10.1.1.143 (the netmask and d=
efault gateway are the same for the virtual and real pc).
  fault.
  The vm cannot see the rest of the local network or visa-versa. This used =
to work in early (0.9 32bit) versions of qemu.
