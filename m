Yes. The idea is that we don't want to expose some feature to the guest
if we already know it cannot work. The same stands for migration, if
we know the destination host doesn't support the feature, we don't want
to confuse the guest because the feature disappeared unexpectedly. The
correct way to address that is to check the feature is supported in QEMU
and/or KVM before we start the guest or before we accept a migration
stream and fail early if we can't provide the feature.

Speaking of migration, kvmppc_fwnmi_enable() should be called in a
post load callback... and the problem I see is that this is a vCPU
ioctl. So either we add a state "I should enable FWNMI on post load"
to the vCPU that called nmi,register, or maybe first_cpu can do the
trick in a post load callback of vmstate_spapr_machine_check.

BTW, since FWNMI is a platform wide feature, ie. you don't need to
enable it on a per-CPU basis), why is KVM_CAP_PPC_FWNMI a vCPU ioctl
and not a VM ioctl ?
