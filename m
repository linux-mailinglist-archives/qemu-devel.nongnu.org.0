David: Indeed ! How stupid I am. I missed the root cause inside QUEMU log f=
ile. This was clear enough...
error: kvm run failed Device or resource busy
This is probably because your SMT is enabled.

So I switch SMT (Power Simultaneous Multi-Threading) off and now it's
OK; VMs are running and installing.

It had been years since I last touched KVM on Power and I lost my reflexes.
So please forget my precedent comment telling I had the same issue on Power=
 platform. It was similar symptoms but not the same problem.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
