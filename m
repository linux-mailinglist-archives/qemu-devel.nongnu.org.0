Many thanks for the reveiw, and sorry about the delay on my side. We
have holidays here in Germany and I was not motivated enough up until
now to check on my mails.


I've actually played  with the thought of switching iommu_platform to 
'on/off/auto', but I didn't find an easy way to do it. I will look
again. This would be the first property of this kind in QEMU, or?

The 'on/off/auto' would be certainly much cleaner form user-interface
perspective. The downsides are that it is more invasive, and more
complicated. I'm afraid that it would also leave more possibilities for
user error.

I think we have "allow protected" already expressed via cpu models. I'm
also not sure how libvirt would react to the idea of a new machine
property for this. You did mean "allow protected" as machine property,
or?

AFAIU "allow protected" would be required for the !PV to PV switch, and
we would have to reject paravirtualized devices with iommu_platform='off'
on VM construction or hotplug (iommu_platform='auto/on' would be fine).

Could you please confirm that I understood this correctly?

This is already covered by cpu model AFAIK.

You mean the like rename 'iommu_platform' to 'platform_access'? I like
the idea, but I'm not sure libvirt will like it as well. Boris any
opinions?

Changing the device features is IMHO all right because the features can
change only immediately after a system reset and before the first vCPU
is run. That is ensured by two facts.


First, the feature can only change when ms->pv changes. That is on the
first reset after the VM entered or left the "protected virtualization"
mode of operation. And that switch requires a system reset. Because the
PV switch is initiated by the guest, and the guest is rebooted as a
consequence, the guest will never observe the change in features.

By the way, when switching between PV and !PV the features of the
cpu (model) also change.

Second,  virtio_ccw_reset() -- the function that is modified -- does
not get called on a reset that is initiated via the transport. We have
virtio_ccw_reset_virtio() for that.

You mean the "base-commit: SHA-1"?

It is what the --base option of git format-patch generates, and it tells
what exact commit the series is based on. Can be useful when it is not
clear against which git subtree was developed, or for comparatively old
series. It hopefully also indicates what code level was tested by the
developer.


Thanks again!
