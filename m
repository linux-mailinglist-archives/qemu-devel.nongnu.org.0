I believe my phone gave up on the last few minutes of the call so I'll
just say we are interested in being able to implement arbitrary devices
in the inter-VM silos. Devices we are looking at:

  virtio-audio
  virtio-video

these are performance sensitive devices which provide a HAL abstraction
to a common software core.

  virtio-rpmb

this is a secure device where the backend may need to reside in a secure
virtualised world.

  virtio-scmi

this is a more complex device which allows the guest to make power and
clock demands from the firmware. Needless to say this starts to become
complex with multiple moving parts.

The flexibility of vhost-user seems to match up quite well with wanting
to have a reasonably portable backend that just needs to be fed signals
and a memory mapping. However we don't want daemons to automatically
have a full view of the whole of the guests system memory.

I'm wondering if there is enough plumbing on the guest side so a guest
can use the virtio-iommu to mark out exactly which bits of memory the
virtual device can have access to? At a minimum the virtqueues need to
be accessible and for larger transfers maybe a bounce buffer. However
for speed you want as wide as possible mapping but no more. It would be
nice for example if a block device could load data directly into the
guests block cache (zero-copy) but without getting a view of the kernels
internal data structures.

Another thing that came across in the call was quite a lot of
assumptions about QEMU and Linux w.r.t virtio. While our project will
likely have Linux as a guest OS we are looking specifically at enabling
virtio for Type-1 hypervisors like Xen and the various safety certified
proprietary ones. It is unlikely that QEMU would be used as the VMM for
these deployments. We want to work out what sort of common facilities
hypervisors need to support to enable virtio so the daemons can be
re-usable and maybe setup with a minimal shim for the particular
hypervisor in question.
