Chenyi,

This is not we have discussed. I prefer to changing the logic of 
versioned CPU model to not add the features in versioned CPU model to 
env->user_features[]. They're not supposed to be added to 
env->user_features[] since they're not set by user through -feature/+feature

Eduardo,

What do you think?
