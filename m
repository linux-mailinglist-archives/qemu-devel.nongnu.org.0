As a short-term fix this works.  I'm willing to apply this to 5.0 with cc:
stable so that as a bug fix this gets pulled back to 4.2.1.  Paolo's request
for a comment is en pointe, so I'll wait for a version 2.

However, while running in system mode with a decent sized amount of guest ram,
I see 1-2M tbs live at once.  We don't really want to throw all of those away.

I think it would be better to put the tbs into some sort of data structure that
indexes the tbs by their virtual address.  I have no strong feelings about what
sort of data structure would be best, just something better than a linear
search of all of the tbs.  :-)
