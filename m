Oh true, I forgot it would have implications for usability of the -cpu
flag choices, I was only thinking about the guest OS, as you can sitll
use a guest OS compiled for z900 even if the BIOS is targetting z10.

So need to compile BIOS with z900 is effectively equivalent to the need
to compile x86 BIOS for oldest generation CPU.

Downstream distros have the choice to limit what CPUs they wish to
support, but upstream if QEMU targets legacy emulation use cases, then
we want to support all CPUs.

Daniel
