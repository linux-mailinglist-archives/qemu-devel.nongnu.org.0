It turns out I actually did do a JSON version, as the follow up to the
version Cédric reposted; but then that got lost in people not liking
JSON;   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-09/msg01041.html

Having just resurrected that code, the only difference from my patch
then and what I just wrote was that instead of doing the object
resolution and stuff, I just call the qmp function.
It's still JSON output and I don't think the arguments from 4 years ago
moved forward.  I'll post it soon.
