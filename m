You know, if I had to write a *general purpose* parser for a language
that obviously supports numbers of arbitrary precision (but permits
implementations to support less), then I'd try *hard* to stay as general
as practical.  At the very least, provide a way to retrieve number
tokens as strings, so the decision to limit precision devolves to the
client.  Also, GMP exists.

The fact that "most viable alternatives" to YAJL are unable to support
uint64_t tempts me to condemn the whole lot as toys :)

I suspect the simplicity of JSON not only lowers the barrier for toys,
but also dampens the demand for general purpose non-toys.  Writing and
maintaining yet another JSON parser is quite possibly easier than
getting one of the toys fixed up properly.
