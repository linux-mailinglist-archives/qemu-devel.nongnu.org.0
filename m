I don't notice this before. Is this only for the convenience of=20
development? I guess libvirt should have native support like adding port=20
to bridge/OVS without the help any external command or script.

Yes.

I believe management should only use fd parameter of TAP. If we have=20
other, it should be a duplication. So I suggest to deprecate the bridge=20
helper and -netdev bridge.
