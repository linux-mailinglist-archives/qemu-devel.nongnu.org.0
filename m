This was indeed considered (all 3 methods) but it has the following =
issues:

Physical geometries of devices must now also be logical geometries with =
translation=3Dnone.
When the OS will query these devices - It will now see different =
physical geometries, adapted to be logical geometries.
I=E2=80=99m not sure even how to implement this without breaking =
existing compatibility - since we don=E2=80=99t want to affect logical =
geometries of currently used guests.
MODE_PAGE_HD_GEOMETRY does not contain the spts, only cylinders (as 3 =
byte number) and heads (as 1 byte number) and computes the spts using: =
number_of_total_sectors / (heads * cylinders), this means that qemu now =
must report number_of_total_sectors as heads * cylinders * spt for =
SeaBIOS to correctly receive the number of spts - this is not optimal =
since number_of_total_sectors can not reflect the real amount of sectors =
in the disk which should be reported from CDB_CMD_READ_CAPACITY.
Moving a scsi-hd/virtio-blk with 255 physical heads to ide-hd, we will =
still need to report 255 heads - this is possible since a whole byte can =
be used in the =E2=80=9Cide identify=E2=80=9D command, but goes against =
the spec of a maximum of 16 heads for IDE.

Overall this approach is much more complicated.
