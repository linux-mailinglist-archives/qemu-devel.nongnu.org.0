The patch from Peter should fix my problems that I triggered via the iotests 
- but the migration-qtest is still unstable independent from that issue, I 
think. See for example the latest staging pipeline:

  https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/pipelines/767961842

The migration qtest failed in both, the x86-freebsd-build and the 
ubuntu-20.04-s390x-all pipelin.
