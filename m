Here's some previous mails discussing the same question about what=20
block_status should actually mean.  At the time, I was so scared of the=20
prospect of something breaking if I changed things that I ended up=20
keeping status quo, so here we are revisiting the topic several years=20
later, still asking the same questions.

That may be right in describing the current situation, but again, needs=20
a GOOD audit of what we are actually using it for, and whether it is=20
what we really WANT to be using it for.  If we're going to=20
audit/refactor the code, we might as well get semantics that are=20
actually useful, rather than painfully contorted to documentation that=20
happens to match our current contorted code.
