See Joel's patch which has a simple example : =20

   patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1196519

It simply generates object properties :=20


+    for (led =3D 0; led < s->nr_leds; led++) {
+        char *name;
+
+        name =3D g_strdup_printf("led%d", led);
+        object_property_add(obj, name, "bool", pca9552_get_led, pca9552_=
set_led,
+                            NULL, NULL, NULL);
+    }

with defined get and set accessors.=20

We could do the same for the OCC sensors with a table describing the=20
sensor layout. Accessors would just simply update the table. we could
even trigger the OCC interrupt if needed.

This is the initial table :

  https://github.com/open-power/occ/blob/master/src/occ_405/sensor/sensor=
_info.c

Linux should be able to grab the values through hwmon just as on real HW.
This is the case today for the DTS.

Yes. I suppose there is some chip id in the powerbus message.
