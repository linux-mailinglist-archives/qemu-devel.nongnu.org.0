Don't trust what is shown by patchew, as that's been through many
hops.

The copy I receieved came directly to me via CC, so didn't hit mailman,
nor patchew, and that *only* has  "Content-type: text/plain".  So the
extra Content-type line with utf8 must have been added either by
mailman or patchew.

So it probably looks like a config problem in the tool you use to send
the patches originally.

With regards,
Daniel
