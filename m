True.

I=E2=80=99m not sure I agree.
It is quite likely that vCPU is currently in guest-mode while you are =
migrating=E2=80=A6
A good hypervisor tries to maximise CPU time to be in guest-mode rather =
than host-mode. :)

I prefer to block migration and once we formally complete the =
implementation of SVM nested state,
we can modify QEMU code such that migration of vCPU exposed with SVM =
will work in case
nested-state states that guest is in host-mode.
