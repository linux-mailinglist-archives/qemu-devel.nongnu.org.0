Thanks, Greg. The statements here clarify the forced conversion (casting) i=

allowed, even I don't think it's safe to do so.

Yes, as above statements said.

It's arguable to be correct enough. The NMIClass and the associated callbac=
k
(nmi_monitor_handler()) are attached to the parent class, which is "pc-q35-=
4.2-machine"
in our example. The interface is strongly associated with the parent class.=
 From
this perspective, it also makes sense to pass the parent object.

However, we didn't run into any issue so far. Maybe the code can be revisit=
ed
when it needs to be improved later, or never :)

Yeah, nothing is wrong currently. macio_gpio_nmi() is the only case
where the NMIState is consumed after correct casting is applied.
