I see where you're coming from, but I like -drive - it's simple for
simple things; maybe it's a nightmare for some others, but if I just
want a VM with a disk on virtio, it's easy.

But I agree if you have good building blocks and they're easy to
understand and easy to represent, it's not a bad start.

Yes, it works for some things.

Some other pet hates:

While I hate XML, there's a certain niceness in using the same thing as
libvirt for places that mean the same thing; but that would have the bad
requirement that things meant *exactly* the same thing.

But, for machine representations, I'm not sure moving away from JSON is
a requirement.
