I think the theory is like this:

1. bdrv_unref() can only be called from the main thread

2. A block node for which bdrv_close() is called has no references. If
   there are no more parents that keep it in a non-default iothread,
   they should be in the main AioContext. So no locks need to be taken
   during bdrv_close().

In practice, 2. is not fully true today, even though block devices do
stop their dataplane and move the block nodes back to the main
AioContext on shutdown. I am currently working on some fixes related to
this, afterwards the situation should be better.

Do you have an example where this happens?

Normally, leaving the coroutine means that the AioContext lock is
released, but it is later reentered from the same AioContext, so the
lock will be taken again.

Hm, I think it should only disappear when the image file is actually
closed. But in practice, it probably makes little difference either way.
