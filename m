Title:
  empty qcow2

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  I plugged multiple qcow2 to a Windows guest. On the Windows disk
  manager all disks are listed perfectly, with their data, their real
  space, I even can explore all files on the Explorer, all cool

  On third party disk manager (all of them), I only have the C:\ HDD who
  act normally, all the other plugged qcow2 are seen as fully
  unallocated, so I can't manipulate them

  I want to move some partitions, create others, but on Windows disk
  manager I can't extend or create partition and on third party I didn't
  see the partitions at all

  Even guestfs doesn't recognize any partition table `libguestfs: error:
  inspect_os: /dev/sda: not a partitioned device`
