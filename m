Won't these be different chip parts? Or at least revs of the part?

I think broadly the difference between SoC devices is handled by
handling versioning in the board models - the board being in this case a
CPU core + a bunch of SoC components + the actual board itself.

All the target/cpu stuff needs to deal with is actual architectural
revs (c.f. target/arm/cpu[64].c).
