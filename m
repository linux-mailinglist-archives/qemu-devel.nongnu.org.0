Public bug reported:

I use macOS with own built Qemu to run old XP system that I have migrated f=
rom physical machine. My setup is very simple qemu-system-x86_64 with args:
-machine pc,accel=3Dhvf,usb=3Doff,vmport=3Doff
-cpu host
-vga std
-m 2048
-drive file=3D"$img",format=3Dqcow2,cache=3Dnone,detect-zeroes=3Don
-usb -device usb-tablet

Unfortunately as soon I enable HVF with first 2 lines WinXP SP3 hangs on
boot (famous mup.sys). It works fine in TCG.

I dived into the code checking the differences between HVF, KVM and HAXM
and my analysis is:

1. Sergio Andres Gomez Del Real b7394c8394 - replaces explicit
VMCS_GUEST_INTERRUPTIBILITY checks with hflags/hflags2.

2. Paolo Bonzini 92d5f1a414 - changes hflags/hflags2 behavior which
breaks in the end HVF interrupt handling and makes WinXP unable to boot.
NOTE: This does not break I believe KVM and HAXM as they still do
explicit check instead what HVF does in 1. That's why it was probably
not reported and Qemu macOS users are rather niche ;)

Reverting 92d5f1a414 makes WinXP boot well and work flawlessly.
Unfortunately b7394c8394 is not easy anymore as too many changes on the way=
, so it may be not an option.

This can be reproduced simply by installing /Users/ono/VM/ISO/en_windows_xp=
_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974.iso
with HAL as "Standard PC" selectable with F5 on first run.

I can also provide fresh ~600MB qcow2 image (without activation key
entered yet) that is created before boot that fails. No need for full XP
installation to test that.

Nevertheless I would really appreciate Paolo looking into this.
Many thanks for great software,
Adam
