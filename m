Thank you very much for the quick response!

Honestly, I overlooked the memory-backed machine property, but regardless
of that -machine,memory-backend=id *does not seem viable* at the
moment.

My understanding is that one has to do something like:        
-machine type=s390-ccw-virtio,memory-backend=mem \
-object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=2G,mem-path=/dev/shm/virtiofs.shm,share=on \

I get 
qemu: : Device 'mem' not found
because the 'memory-backend-*' objects are delayed,
i.e. !object_create_initial(), and at the time when
machine_set_property() tries to look the memory-backend up the
memory-backend is not yet created.

For why delayed, object_create_initial()  has a comment:

    /* Memory allocation by backends needs to be done
     * after configure_accelerator() (due to the tcg_enabled()
     * checks at memory_region_init_*()).
     *
     * Also, allocation of large amounts of memory may delay
     * chardev initialization for too long, and trigger timeouts
     * on software that waits for a monitor socket to be created
     * (e.g. libvirt).
     */
    if (g_str_has_prefix(type, "memory-backend-")) {

Or, am I using it wrong?

I agree.
