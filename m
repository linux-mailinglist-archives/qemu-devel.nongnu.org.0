'info registers' is a challenge for JSON since it's all 64bit unsigned
int's;  you really want the result to be in hex, and definitely not to
have been randomly sign extended or truncated, or converted to float or
whatever other evils a json processor might do.  So the user wants
a nice consistent format.

'info qtree' and 'info mtree' are other interesting cases that I use
very frequently.
