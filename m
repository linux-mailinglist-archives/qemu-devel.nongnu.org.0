Since Paolo's only suggesting move of the git server here, it should not
impact anything that is done today. Any CLI tools that talk plain git
to git.qemu.org will work unchanged against git.qemu.org or gitlab.com.


To answer your question though, GitLab has an extensive REST API that
lets you drive almost everything that is exposed in their Web UI. There
is my own Bichon tool (https://gitlab.com/bichon-project/bichon) that
uses the API to provide an interactive terminal based review UI, while
the Lab tool (https://github.com/zaquestion/lab) provides a text based
non-interactive CLI for use from shell/scripts again using the REST
API.


Not commonly known is that GitLab also has support for Git push options,
which let you create merge requests using a plain "git push":

  https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/push_options.html

eg if you have a remote called "gitlab", you can open a MR from the CLI
using

 $ git push -o merge_request.create \
            -o merge_request.title="Do awesome thing" \
            gitlab my-branch

This is something that I could see being easily wired up into a
"git-publish" like tool for example.

Daniel
