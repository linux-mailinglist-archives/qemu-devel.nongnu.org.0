As our discussion shows, this script is somewhat hard to understand.
That's okay, it solves a somewhat thorny problem, and I don't have
better ideas.  But let me state the intended transformations once more,
so I don't get lost in the details.

Motivation:

1. Make error propagation less error-prone and improve stack backtraces

   The "receive error in &local_error, propagate to @errp" pattern is
   tedious, error-prone, and produces unhelpful stack backtraces with
   &error_abort.

   ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() removes manual propagation.  It additionally
   gives us the stack backtraces we want.

2. Improve error messages with &error_fatal

   Passing @errp to error_append_hint(), error_prepend() or
   error_vprepend() is useless when @errp is &error_fatal.

   ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() fixes this by delaying &error_fatal handling
   until the automatic propagation.

The intended transformation has three parts:

* Replace declaration of @local_err by ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() where
  needed for 1 or 2.

  It's needed when we also drop some error propagation from the function
  (motivation 1), or the function calls error_append_hint(),
  error_prepend() or error_vprepend() (motivation 2).  A function could
  do both.  I'll refer back to this below.

* Drop error_propagate(errp, local_err)

  Special case: error_propagate_prepend(errp, local_err, ...) becomes
  error_prepend(errp, ...).

  Only correct if there is no other such error_propagate() /
  error_propagate_prepend() on any path from the here to return.

* Replace remaining use of @local_err by *errp

I'm fine with not touching "strange" patterns.  But we do at least in
the example I gave below: we still add ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE().

We either avoid that in the Coccinelle script, or we catch it
afterwards.  Catching it afterwards should be feasible:

* If we also drop some error propagation from this function: okay.

* If this function call error_append_hint(), error_prepend() or
  error_vprepend(): okay.

* Else: unwanted, back out.

Moreover, I'd like us to double-check we really don't want to touch the
things we don't touch.  Feels feasible to me, too: after running
Coccinelle, search for unconverted error_append_hint(), error_prepend(),
error_vprepend(), error_propagate_prepend(), error_propagate().

I'm not sure I understand this sentence.

The aim of my "possible improvement" is to avoid unwanted
ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() in the Coccinelle script.  We can instead search
for unwanted ones after the Coccinelle run, and back them out.

Something like this, perhaps?

       // Convert remaining local_err usage, typically error checking.
