@paelzer,  Aye and thanks for your comment #27 ,  I was already aware of
that, and yes that does work. However, it's a shoddy workaround at best
and if this is going to be a solution to be presented to a customer MAAS
would be scoffed at.

I'm aware of the issue at hand here, I think the problem existing now,
is that a decision needs to be made moving forward how to fix this.  I
was about to suggest that what makes the most sense IMO and is the least
invasive is the suggest by @paelzer from comment #29

Maas can boot from network (always) and if not deploying just issue a
"reboot from disk" command

Title:
  [2.6] Unable to reboot s390x KVM machine after initial deploy

Status in MAAS:
  New
Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  MAAS version: 2.6.1 (7832-g17912cdc9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1)
  Arch: S390x

  Appears that MAAS can not find the s390x bootloader to boot from the
  disk, not sure how maas determines this.  However this was working in
  the past. I had originally thought that if the maas machine was
  deployed then it defaulted to boot from disk.

  If I force the VM to book from disk, the VM starts up as expected.

  Reproduce:

  - Deploy Disco on S390x KVM instance
  - Reboot it

  on the KVM console...
