Is there a large performance penalty for that?

Yeah, I see what you are saying. It just becomes difficult to manage
though. It all worked fine until there are conflicts between the priv
specs.

I'm open to other options, but masking them like this seems like more
work and also seems confusing. The extension will end up enabled in
QEMU and potentially visible to external tools, but then just not
exposed to the guest. It seems prone to future bugs.
