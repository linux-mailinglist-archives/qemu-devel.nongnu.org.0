We have no way to block based on version - and that's a pretty painful
thing to do; we can block based on machine type.

But before we get there; can we understand in which combinations that
things break and why exactly - would it break on a 1 or 2 vCPU guest -
or would it only break when we get to the point the upper bits start
being used for example?  Why exaclty would it break - i.e. is it going
to change the name of sections in the migration stream - or are the
values we need actually going to migrate OK?
