  I think email is best and easiest for all.

| We certainly should NOT get into the business of writing or hosting
| custom solutions ourselves IMHO. Even if someone volunteers to do the
| work upfront, that'll inevitably turn into abandonware a few years
| hence when the interested party moves onto other things.

* I don't know of any list provider which supports encryption.

* For custom software, there is this 'schleuder' project

   -> https://0xacab.org/schleuder/schleuder
   -> https://schleuder.org/schleuder/docs/concept.html
      A gpg-enabled mailing list manager with resending-capabilities.  

* I have not used it or played with it.


| I still question whether we genuinely need encrypted mailing lists in
| the first place.
| 
| Our of all the security reports QEMU has received how many reporters
| actually used GPG to encrypt their reporters, and how often did the
| security team actually keep using GPG when triaging and resolving it
| thereafter.
| 
| Out of countless security issues I've dealt with across many software
| projects for 10 years, there have been less than 5 occassions where
| encryption was used with email by a bug reporter notifying me, and out
| of those only 1 of them actually justified the use of GPG.
| 
| For projects that did use confidential issues, they still all emailed
| notifications in clear text behind the scenes regardless.
|
| Is it not sufficient to just use a regular mailing list by default,
| and continue publish security team pgp email addrs + keys for the
| few cases where pgp might be desired.

* True, need & usage of encryption is debatable and difficult.

* Above points and possible solution of keeping the current handful PGP keys 
  available did come up earlier

  -> https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg05213.html


* At this point I think, let's get started with a regular list for now. We can 
  still continue to explore encryption support options.


@Stefanha: do we need to file a request ticket to create 'qemu-security' list?


Thank you.
