The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  local/9pfs: Too many levels of symbolic links

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Version: 2.9.1

  The primary symptom is resolving symlink fails w/ error "too many
  levels of symbolic links".

  My analysis showed that local_readlink() uses local_open_nofollow() to
  open the file and then tries to read it. local_open_nofollow() then
  tries to open the file w/ O_NOFOLLOW, which obviously fails if the
  requested file is a symlink.
