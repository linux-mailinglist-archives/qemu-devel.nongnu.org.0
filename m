I agree kvmtool isn't a great test because it doesn't support migration. 
The support in this series is just the basic support for MTE in a guest 
and we'd need to wait for the QEMU implementation before deciding 
whether we need any extra support (e.g. kernel interfaces for 
reading/writing tags as discussed before).

However, I don't think there's much danger of the support in this series 
changing - so extra support can be added when/if it's needed, but I 
don't think we need to block these series on that - QEMU can just probe 
for whatever additional support it needs before enabling MTE in a guest. 
I plan to rebase/repost after -rc1 when the user space support has been 
merged.
