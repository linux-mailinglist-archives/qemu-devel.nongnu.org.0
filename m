You mean KVM uses 1:1 EPT pages and no guest paging,
to allow guest to access host physical address space?
That would break the security completely, thus I think you
mean something else here.

Here a quote from the PRM:

"The first processors to support VMX operation require CR0.PE and CR0.PG =
to be 1 in VMX operation (see Section
23.8). This restriction implies that guest software cannot be run in unpa=
ged protected mode or in real-address
mode. Later processors support a VM-execution control called =E2=80=9Cunr=
estricted guest=E2=80=9D. 1 If this control is 1, CR0.PE and
CR0.PG may be 0 in VMX non-root operation. Such processors allow guest so=
ftware to run in unpaged protected
mode or in real-address mode. The following items describe the behavior o=
f such software:"
...

"As noted in Section 26.2.1.1, the =E2=80=9Cenable EPT=E2=80=9D VM-execut=
ion control must be 1 if the =E2=80=9Cunrestricted guest=E2=80=9D VM-exec=
ution control is 1."
