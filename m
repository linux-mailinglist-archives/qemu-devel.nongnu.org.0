I could now also reproduce the same with AmigaOS4 on pegasos2 where I got 
same missing interrupt problem:

---> Port 1
IOBase 00001010, AltBase 0000101E
bmcr_base 00001028
MMIOBase 00000000

Starting 'peg2ide.device - chip 0 port 1' task
bmdma_addr_write data: 0x0000000002290000
Trying to configure unit 2

Hangs here waiting for interrupt which does not seem to arrive, then:

[peg2ide/irq_wait] timed out
[peg2ide/exec_pio_data_in_cmd] <- here
[peg2ide/ata_read_drive_properties] unit 2 returned error 255, failbits 00000000h, timeout 0
Trying to configure unit 3
[peg2ide/ata_read_drive_properties] After-reset signature invalid for unit 3

So there's definitely a problem with interrupts but not sure where. Also 
don't know why it detects an unknown slave device which then it decides is 
invalid. Maybe this is normal on an IDE bus with only one device or is it 
a problem in emulation?

To locate the problem further I've then tried the same with ide-cd 
connected to the sii3112 SATA emulation that also shares the same IDE 
BMDMA code with CMD646 and via-ide but as a PCI card the interrupt routing 
is different. So if I don't get the problem with it then that can prove 
common code is correct. If I get the problem it may come from common code 
or be another interrupt routing problem.

I did not have PCI interrupts correctly implemented in pegasos2 yet so I 
had to fix that first but I'm not sure it's correct yet. I got similar 
results but the interrupt seems to fire in this case but does not get to 
the CPU as it does not seem to be enabled:

[sii3112ide/ata_read_drive_properties] unit 0 returned error 255, failbits 00000000h, timeout 0

So here I see there's an interrupt raised by the card which does also get 
to the mv64361 system controller that's also the interrupt controller on 
pegasos2 but CPU IRQ is not raised because the corresponding mask bit is 
not set for some reason.

This suggests the common IDE bmdma and ide-cd code is likely OK and 
problem is somewhere in irq routing. What's relevant for this thread and 
sparc64 is that then you should also check interrupt controller and 
routing if an interrupt raised by the IDE controller could get to the CPU 
in your case as that could be where the problem is and maybe not in 
common code as I've suspected before.

For my case I'm not sure. On pegasos2 irqs come in via the mv64361 gpio 
ports, the irq pin of the VIA south bridge (containing via-ide and the 16 
isa interrupts) is connected to gpp_irq 31 while the PCI INTA-D lines are 
connected to gpp_irq 12-15. These are mapped to interrupt cause bits 56-59 
so that gpp0-7 gets 56, gpp8-15 57, gpp16-23 58 and gpp 24-31 gets 59. 
Thus the IRQ numbers seem correct in the above but the expected interrupt 
on 59 is only raised when the sii3112 driver is insalling its interrupt 
handler (not sure why does it call that irq 25?). This should have been 
raised when talking to device on via-ide much earlier. Then when talking 
to device on sii3112 the interrupt arrives from PCI on the expected 57 but 
CPU IRQ is not raised because it is masked, only gpp 31 is enabled. This 
supposedly works on real hardware but don't get why it doesn't on my 
emulation. It's probably a bug in the IRQ controller emulation then and 
topic for another thread and other platforms that similar error happens 
may also have bugs in their IRQ routing.
