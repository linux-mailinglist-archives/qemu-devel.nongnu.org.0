Well I think the total number of guest instructions is important because
some architectures are more efficient than others and this will an
impact on the total executed instructions.

Knowing the ratio (especially as it changes between workloads) means you
can better pin point where the inefficiencies lie. You don't want to
spend your time chasing down an inefficiency that is down to the guest
compiler ;-)=20
