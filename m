I don't think I ever asked for a respin just to adjust style.  I always
offer to adjust style myself in my tree.  If a respin is needed for some
other reason, also making the style adjustments I requested is courteous
and appreciated.

I don't think I ever rejected a patch just due to differences over
style.  If a patch submitter refused to make the style adjustments I
want, and refused to permit me to make them, I'd commit as is, then maye
adjust on top.  This is hypothetical.

When I do that, and you'd rather have a complete list, just ask.  Out of
time for today, but I can get it for you first thing tomorrow.
