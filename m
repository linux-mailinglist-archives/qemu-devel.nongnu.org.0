Oh I think I see the point now...  So what matters is not the general
OOB messages, but actually when OOB is disabled or when OOB queue is
full.  In other words, json_message_parser_feed() can call
monitor_suspend() itself, so we must make sure
json_message_parser_feed() is still called with size=3D=3D1 always,
otherwise we can't suspend monitors properly.

I see that patch 2 did this right on checking against suspend_cnt
before each call of json_message_parser_feed(size=3D=3D1), so it seems
good..  And yes in that case the ring buffer is needed to achieve this.
