The downside of using the bus daemon is that we have to spawn a new
instance of dbus-daemon for every QEMU VM that's running on the host,
which is yet more memory overhead for each VM & another process to
manage, and yet another thing to go wrong.

QEMU already has a direct UNIX socket connection to the helper
processes in question. I'd much rather we just had another direct
UNIX socket  connection to that helper, using D-Bus peer-to-peer.
The benefit of debugging doesn't feel compelling enough to justify
running an extra daemon for each VM.

Daniel
