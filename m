Testing it appears it tolerates a ";" but GLib doesn't use it typically
in this case.

Yes.

Yes, I was in two minds here, whether to illustrate the real inline
function, or the macro. I choose the macro to make it clear what kind
of code is being replaced, rather than what kind of code it strictly
produces.
