I think converting the CLI is doable in the short term. I already have
the patch for qemu-storage-daemon, but decided to keep it for a separate
series.

The most difficult part is probably -readconfig, but with Paolo's RFC
patches to move it away from QemuOpts, even that shouldn't be very hard.

I haven't given much though to the details yet, but I was thinking of
introducing a new QAPI entity type for objects. We could include
additional fields there, where the type would just directly be a C type
rather than being interpreted by QAPI.

Maybe like this:

{ 'object': 'secret-common',
  'abstract': true,
  'properties': 'SecretCommonProperties',
  'state': { 'rawdata': '*uint8_t',
             'rawlen': 'size_t' } }

{ 'object': 'secret',
  'parent': 'secret-common',
  'properties': 'SecretProperties' } }

Maybe it would actually be nicer to have 'state' just as a string
property that contains the C type name of the state struct and then QAPI
just adds a pointer to it.

Either way, there is some duplication there because we have a
parent-child relationship both between the object types themselves and
between their property classes. Either we remove the base from
SecretProperties (which would make object-add and the CLI more
complicated) or we just let the QAPI generator check that they are
consistent.

secret doesn't need writable properties, but for those objects that do
need it, I would include a list that defines some properties as having
setters and then the QAPI generated property code would call a manually
written callback.

Isn't this the job of the normal .instance_finalize method?
