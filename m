We don't consider too much in the point when introducing vhost. And=20
before IOTLB, vhost has already know GPA through its mem table=20
(GPA->HVA). So it's nature and easier to track dirty pages at GPA level=20
then it won't any changes in the existing ABI.

For VFIO case, the only advantages of using GPA is that the log can then=20
be shared among all the devices that belongs to the VM. Otherwise=20
syncing through IOVA is cleaner.
