I'm not really following. Why isn't a double inversion just the same
as no inversion?

Exactly.

Yes. Historically the cells values are meaningful to the provider and
opaque to the consumer. Standardized cell values changes that
somewhat. I think we want the active flag to be from the provider's
prospective because the provider always needs to know. The consumer
often doesn't need to know. That also means things work without the
GPIO_INVERTED flag if the consumer doesn't care which is what we have
today already and we can't go back in time.

I suppose so, yes.

Good question. Perhaps in a different way because we have to handle
both h/w controlled and gpio chip selects.

However, how would one configure the polarity in the device in the
first place? You have to assert the CS first to give a command to
reprogram it.
