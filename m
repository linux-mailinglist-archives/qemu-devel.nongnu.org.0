Yes, it's fixed in v4.2.0, and with the help of your test program I've
bisect to the fix:

commit 1645fb5a1e537f85eda744bfa6e9d3dda047ba28
Author: Shu-Chun Weng <scw@google.com>
Date:   Thu Oct 17 17:19:20 2019 -0700

    Fix unsigned integer underflow in fd-trans.c
    =

    In any of these `*_for_each_*` functions, the last entry in the buffer =
(so the
    "remaining length in the buffer" `len` is equal to the length of the
    entry `nlmsg_len`/`nla_len`/etc) has size that is not a multiple of the
    alignment, the aligned lengths `*_ALIGN(*_len)` will be greater than `l=
en`.
    Since `len` is unsigned (`size_t`), it underflows and the loop will read
    pass the buffer.
    =

    This may manifest as random EINVAL or EOPNOTSUPP error on IO or network
    system calls.
    =

Title:
  qemu user static binary seems to lack support for network namespace.

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Whenever I execute emerge in gentoo linux in qemu-aarch64 chroot, I
  see the following error message.

  Unable to configure loopback interface: Operation not supported

  If I disable emerge's network-sandbox which utilizes network
  namespace, the error disappears.
