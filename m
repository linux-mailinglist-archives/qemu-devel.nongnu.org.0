Yes.  Can be viewed as a tree of depth 1.  Parallel doesn't contradict
tree.

No argument.

Supports the idea that inadequate device modelling contributes to the
problem.

One of the stated reasons for the invention of QOM was better device
modelling.  Sadly, we've done that only in a few corners.  There's too
much left of qdev's oversimplified design.  Or maybe too little left of
qdev's initial simplicity.  We're not exactly in a happy place there,
I'm afraid.

Fair enough.

Makes sense.

Registering qbus_reset_all_fn() in main() is kind of ugly, but it works.
There's a comment pointing out it's ugly.  Right now it's a TODO
comment, which maybe expresses more hope for cleanup than there really
is.  I'd leave it alone anyway.
