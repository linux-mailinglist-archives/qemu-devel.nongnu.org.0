To an extent, I'd like to emphasize that our "users" are increasingly
developers from other projects and these internal docs are primarily
useful for this crowd.

I am not sure what the value in plaintext Sphinx docs are, since they
lose the hyperlinks ... unless you keep it in ReST or Markdown format,
and then you could just install the source documents, no?

I just seem to think that most of the text-only purists are also the
type to already have the source tree checked out somewhere.

As long as we've got HTML + manpages, I think we're doing OK.

Good riddance. I assume this also means we need to rewrite the QAPI
comments to use Sphinx-ese instead of Texi-ese.

I think that'd be good, though, because it means we get proper lexing
and parsing on our examples. Especially in places where we
cross-reference; for example -- QMP has this trick where our commands
don't take any arguments themselves but rather define a data type it
expects as input.

In the output manual, this means that we don't document the arguments
near the function, which is awful.

Sphinx can help us cross-reference these things better.

It looks good to me overall -- any progress towards a unified manual
with automatic checking of any sort is an improvement.

I'll try to keep an eye on it over the summer and see if I can't help
nudge the block layer documents along the path to something unified.
I've written one custom extension now, so what's a few more?

I also wrote a hasty script that tried to unify the qemu-img.texi and
qemu-img help outputs and removed one more usage of the hxtool, but it's
only a stopgap and wasn't something like proper sphinx integration, but
maybe I could keep working in that area soon.

I would also like to say that it would be useful to host our HTML docs
online such that we can point to the different versions, like you can
with the official python docs. They often have a little dropdown where
you can switch between 3.5/3.6/3.7 or so on and see the difference on
that exact page. It'd just simply be nice to be able to do the same for
QMP docs.
