Then I feel like Windows is reluctant to enable DMAR due to lacking of
some caps.

Sorry I don't remember that. I didn't do the test but I was just
acknowledged that with it the test passed.  I assume you're using the
latest QEMU here because I know Windows could require another
capability (DMA draining) and it should be on by default in latest
qemu master.

At that time the complete cmdline to pass the test should be:

  -device intel-iommu,intremap=3Don,aw-bits=3D48,caching-mode=3Doff,eim=3Do=
n

I also don't remember on why caching-mode needs to be off at that
time (otherwise SVVP fails too).
