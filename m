This part seems redundant with the previous paragraph.

All types (enums, structs, simple & flat unions, alternates) actually,
not just complex ones (structs, unions).

What does it mean for a set of members to be compatible?  We don't
actually define that...

What about:

  Since type names are not visible in the Client JSON Protocol, types
  may be freely renamed.  Even certain refactorings are invisible, such
  as splitting members from one type into a common base type.
