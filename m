It is?  VFIO doesn't know GPAs, it only knows HVA, HPA, and IOVA.  In
some cases IOVA is GPA, but not all.

Same as last time, you're asking VFIO to be aware of an entirely new
address space and implement tracking structures of that address space
to make life easier for QEMU.  Don't we typically push such complexity
to userspace rather than into the kernel?  I'm not convinced.  Thanks,
