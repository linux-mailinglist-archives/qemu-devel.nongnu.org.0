Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  usb-host: hostaddr=3D0XX is parsed as octal number

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  when doing

  device_add usb-host,hostaddr=3D010

  taking 010 in the format of both lsusb or udev, qemu parses an octal numb=
er and assumes hostaddr=3D8.
  (i used a 2.0 device on the ehci.0 bus)
  at least to me that is confusing.

  also:

  when adding a non-existent usb device (bogus hostaddr), the following
  is created according to 'usb info':

    Device 1.0, Port 1, Speed 1.5 Mb/s, Product USB Host Device

  in usb_qdev_init():
  usb_claim_port is called but usb_device_init does not report an error and=
 thus usb_release_port is not called.
