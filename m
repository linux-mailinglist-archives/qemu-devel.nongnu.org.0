I think it is hard to call it a bug when we added explicit extra code to
make it work as it does today.

It is really a misguided feature.

From libvirt's POV I don't see a need for introspection. There's no
special action we need to take to deal with the new behaviour - it is
ultimately just providing the behaviour we kind of assumed it already
had.
