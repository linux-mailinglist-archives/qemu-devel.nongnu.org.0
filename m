Sure.

Developers shouldn't worry about that but focus on the testing. The
QEMU project doesn't have dedicated sysadmin / storage, but if it had
it should be their problem, not yours. Meanwhile such a test is still
useful. Artifacts come with their hash, so can be uploaded elsewhere
later.

Similar approach:

Niek can tell how many times his tests catched regressions for his
OrangePi machine; I remember at least 3 occasions :)
