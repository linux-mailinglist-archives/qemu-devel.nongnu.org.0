Hmm, then we probably achieve that effect by clearing the related bit in =
CR4. If
doing that implies an invalidation of the nested state by KVM, we are fin=
e.
Otherwise, I would expect userspace to reset the state to VMCLEAR and pur=
ge any
traces of prior use.

vmx_vcpu_reset is not issued on userspace initiated VM reset, only on INI=
T/SIPI
cycles. It's misleading, and I remember myself running into that when I h=
acked
on KVM back then.
