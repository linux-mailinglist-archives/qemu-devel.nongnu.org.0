Note, we have never equated CI coverage for a platform with the
technical support for a platform. We have sooooo many combinations
which are not tested and are supported from a technical POV. It
would be nice to have comprehensive testing, but we're unlikely
to ever achieve it. IOW, lack automated CI of testing is not a
reason to delete support for a platform, it just means that we'll
rely on manual testing, and users can't have such high confidence
in the platform.


One thing we've not explored is multiple levels of CI coverage.
We could degrade certain platforms to have periodic post-merge
testing, rather than pre-merge. eg cut down gating platform
combos, but then once a week run a broader CI pipeline. This
would allow regressions to creep in periodically for more obscure
combinations, but still give us an alert so we can fix them before
release.

With regards,
Daniel
