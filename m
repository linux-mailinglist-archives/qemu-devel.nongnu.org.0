I fetched
https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Workstation=
/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-31-1.9.iso

And installed it on Ubuntu 20.04 via virt-manager (keeping all things on
its default).

- New
- Local Media
- select ISO (Autodetects F31)
- Forward, Forward, Forward, Finish

Now warnings:
sudo cat /var/log/libvirt/qemu/fedora31.log  | grep warning
<empty>

And it just works, the installer is on the graphical UI and waiting for
me.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
