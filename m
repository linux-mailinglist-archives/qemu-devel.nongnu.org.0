Title:
  aptitude crashes qemu-m68k with handle_cpu_signal received signal
  outside vCPU context

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When building a package with sbuild on Debian, sbuild can use aptitude
  to resolve dependencies.

  Recently, some changes introduced to aptitude or related packages
  cause qemu to crash:
