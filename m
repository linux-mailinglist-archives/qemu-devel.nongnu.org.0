Sorry, I didn't see a mail. The volume is quite high and I missed it. 
For Python issues, the usual suspects are:

Me (Lately),
Markus Armbruster (Primarily around the QAPI parser),
Cleber Rosa (Primarily around VM tests),
Eduardo Habkost (In general).

I must admit I am also quite new to packaging python, but I'm learning 
as I go. For now, we do not have any published package so we do not need 
to maintain any kind of stable API, but there are many places in the 
QEMU source tree that rely on the python packages and must keep working.

OK! I have some patches in progress, let me clean them up for post-5.1 
and I will CC you when I send them. I have been on PTO for a little 
while and was focused on another project, so they have to be resurrected 
a little bit.

I will likely continue to be distracted by other projects, so if you are 
able to help with some of the Python refactoring/redevelopment that will 
be a good help.
