We never made a requirement that the backend must be the same on the
source and the destination. Basically, migration copies the state of
frontends and the user is responsible for having these frontends created
and connected to the right backends on the destination.

Using different paths on the destination is a very obvious requirement
for block devices. It's less obvious for the graph structure, but I
don't see a reason why it couldn't change on migration. Say we were
using local storage on the source, but now we did storage migration to
some network storage, access to which should be throttled.
