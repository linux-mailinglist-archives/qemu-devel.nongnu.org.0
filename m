Sure, it certainly makes sense to have multiple maintainers, but I think in 
this section, it might be better to also have someone who's also a 
maintainer of the qemu-project at gitlab (in case there's something to 
fix/setup with a custom runner for example, and to avoid wrong 
expectations)? Maybe Peter finally wants to join here to get finally away 
from his exclusive merge tests?
