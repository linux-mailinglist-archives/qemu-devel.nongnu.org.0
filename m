Adding Eric & Markus for QAPI modelling questions

Was that a specific app you're using with QEMU that needs this ?

For full support of the abstract namespace we would ned to allow
the "sun_path" to contain an arbitrary mix of NULs and non-NULs
characters, and allow connect() @addrlen to be an arbitrary size.

This patch only allows a single initial NUL, and reqiures @addrlen
to be the full size of sun_path, padding with trailing NULs. This
limitation is impossible to lift with QEMU's current approach to
UNIX sockets, as it relies on passing around a NULL terminated
string, so there's no way to have embedded NULs. Since there's
no explicit length, we have to chooose between forcing the full
sun_path size as @addrlen, or forcing the string length as the
@addrlen value.

IIUC, socat makes the latter decision by default, but has a
flag to switch to the former.

  [man socat]
  unix-tightsocklen=3D[0|1]
  On  socket  operations,  pass  a  socket  address  length that does not
  include the whole struct sockaddr_un record but (besides  other  compo=E2=
=80=90
  nents)  only  the  relevant  part  of  the filename or abstract string.
  Default is 1.
  [/man]

This actually is supported for both abstract and non-abstract
sockets, though IIUC this doesn't make a semantic difference
for non-abstract sockets.

The point is we have four possible combinations

 NON-ABSTRACT + FULL SIZE
 NON-ABSTRACT + MINIMAL SIZE  (default)
 ABSTRACT + FULL SIZE
 ABSTRACT + MINIMAL SIZE  (default)

With your patch doing the latter, it means QEMU supports
only two combinations

  NON+ABSTRACT + FULL SIZE
  ABSTRACT + MINIMAL SIZE

and also can't use "@somerealpath" for a non-abstract
socket, though admittedly this is unlikely.

Socat uses a special option to request use of abstract
sockets. eg ABSTRACT:somepath, and automatically adds
the leading NUL, so there's no need for a special "@"
character. This means that UNIX:@somepath still resolves
to a filesystem path and not a abstract socket path.

Finally, the patch as only added support for connect()
not listen(). I think if QEMU wants to support abstract
sockets we must do both, and also have unit tests added
to tests/test-util-sockets.c


The question is whether we're ok with this simple
approach in QEMU, or should do a full approach with
more explicit modelling.

ie should we change QAPI thus:

{ 'struct': 'UnixSocketAddress',
  'data': {
    'path': 'str',
    'tight': 'bool',
    'abstract': 'bool' } }

where 'tight' is a flag indicating whether to set @addrlen
to the minimal string length, or the maximum sun_path length.
And 'abstract' indicates that we automagically add a leading
NUL.

This would *not* allow for NULs in the middle of path,
but I'm not so bothered about that, since I can't see that
being widely used. If we really did need that it could be
added via a 'base64': 'bool' flag, to indicate that @path
is base64 encoded and thus may contain NULs

From a CLI POV, this could be mapped to QAPI thus

 *  -chardev unix:somepath

      @path=3D=3Dsomepath
      @tight=3D=3Dfalse
      @abstract=3D=3Dfalse

 *  -chardev unix:somepath,tight

      @path=3D=3Dsomepath
      @tight=3D=3Dtrue
      @abstract=3D=3Dfalse

 *  -chardev unix-abstract:somepath

      @path=3D=3Dsomepath
      @tight=3D=3Dfalse
      @abstract=3D=3Dtrue

 *  -chardev unix-abstract:somepath,tight

      @path=3D=3Dsomepath
      @tight=3D=3Dtrue
      @abstract=3D=3Dtrue
