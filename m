Hello, Hailiang

Thanks. I got your point.
In my tests, the mismatch between packets does not happen, so the
network latency does not increase.

By the way, I've tried your commit addressing this issue.
It is useful for low dirty memory and low dirty rate workload.

But in high "buffered IO read/write" workload, it results in PVM
resends massive and same dirty ram pages  every cycle triggered
by DEFAULT_RAM_PENDING_CHECK (default 1 second) timer, so hurt the IO
performance and without improvement of downtime?
Do you have any thoughts about this?

Is it possible to separate the checkpoint invoked by the periodic
timer and the packet mismatch and to use a different strategy
to cope with the long downtime issue?

Thanks.

Regards,
Derek
