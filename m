Currently all preempt code still assumes when postcopy activated it's in
preempt mode.  IIUC such a change will bring an extra phase of postcopy
with no-preempt before preempt enabled.  We may need to teach qemu to
understand that if it's needed.

Meanwhile the initial page requests will not be able to benefit from the
new preempt channel too.

I don't know whether (1) is a valid option if there are use cases that it
cannot cover (on either tls or preempt).  The handshake is definitely the
clean approach.

What's the outcome of such wrongly ordered connections?  Will migration
fail immediately and safely?

For multifd, I think it should fail immediately after the connection
established.

For preempt, I'd also expect the same thing because the only wrong order to
happen right now is having the preempt channel to be the migration channel,
then it should also fail immediately on the first qemu_get_byte().

Hopefully that's still not too bad - I mean, if we can fail constantly and
safely (never fail during postcopy), we can always retry and as long as
connections created successfully we can start the migration safely.  But
please correct me if it's not the case.
