I was talking about the kernel stacks. These are limited to 8K with
no growing and it is a pain point there. Userspace stacks on the
other hand should be able to grow to an reasonable size.

Doh! I know how the guard pages work, but never thought
about them in this way. I guess I don't after all.
Thanks for the explanation!
