This comment is for developers, the warning is for user.

It comes from:

    if (dev->unit >= MAX_FD) {
        error_setg(errp, "Can't create floppy unit %d, bus supports "
                   "only %d units", dev->unit, MAX_FD);
        return;
    }

But you can compile QEMU with MAX_FD=4:

static FDrive *get_drv(FDCtrl *fdctrl, int unit)
{
    switch (unit) {
        case 0: return drv0(fdctrl);
        case 1: return drv1(fdctrl);
#if MAX_FD == 4
        case 2: return drv2(fdctrl);
        case 3: return drv3(fdctrl);
#endif
        default: return NULL;
    }
}

ACPI also handles 4 slots:

static void fdc_isa_build_aml(ISADevice *isadev, Aml *scope)
{
    Aml *dev;
    Aml *crs;
    int i;

#define ACPI_FDE_MAX_FD 4
    uint32_t fde_buf[5] = {
        0, 0, 0, 0,     /* presence of floppy drives #0 - #3 */
        cpu_to_le32(2)  /* tape presence (2 == never present) */
    };

    crs = aml_resource_template();
    aml_append(crs, aml_io(AML_DECODE16, 0x03F2, 0x03F2, 0x00, 0x04));
    aml_append(crs, aml_io(AML_DECODE16, 0x03F7, 0x03F7, 0x00, 0x01));
    aml_append(crs, aml_irq_no_flags(6));
    aml_append(crs,
        aml_dma(AML_COMPATIBILITY, AML_NOTBUSMASTER, AML_TRANSFER8, 2));

    dev = aml_device("FDC0");
    aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_HID", aml_eisaid("PNP0700")));
    aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_CRS", crs));

    for (i = 0; i < MIN(MAX_FD, ACPI_FDE_MAX_FD); i++) {
        FloppyDriveType type = isa_fdc_get_drive_type(isadev, i);

        if (type < FLOPPY_DRIVE_TYPE_NONE) {
            fde_buf[i] = cpu_to_le32(1);  /* drive present */
            aml_append(dev, build_fdinfo_aml(i, type));
        }
    }
    aml_append(dev, aml_name_decl("_FDE",
               aml_buffer(sizeof(fde_buf), (uint8_t *)fde_buf)));

    aml_append(scope, dev);
}

I'm sorry I didn't want to criticize the model or hurt you, I just want
to note the differences between how the controller is described in the
Intel 82078 datasheet and how the QEMU model works. Maybe I'm wrong
assuming there would be a 1:1 match.

I'll repost with the name updated in the schema and removing my
assumptions from the commit description that appears as simple
critics.
