OK, found my issue! :-). Still a bit odd, but virt-manager complaints about=
 the custom QEMU executable =3D> but virsh still works. So I did get the VM=
 running, with,
QEMU emulator version 5.1.93 (v5.2.0-rc3)
Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

But it still performed the same. I also checked the xml file (VM
definition), and made sure to change the machine to the most current
version (pc-q35-5.2), but also no improvement.

Other things to try?

Thanks!

Title:
  Host OS Reboot Required, for Guest kext to Load (Fully)

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  Finding this one a bit odd, but I am loading a driver (kext) in a
  macOS guest ... and it works, on the first VM (domain) startup after a
  full / clean host OS boot (or reboot). However, if I even reboot the
  guest OS, then the driver load fails =3D> can be "corrected" by a full
  host OS reboot (which seems very extreme).

  Is this a known issue, and/or is there a workaround?

  FYI, running,
  QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)
  Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

  This is for a macOS guest, on a Linux host.

  Thanks!
