Note that my message above was not a criticism of why we've got it but
more of a review. This review though it just that removing this is okay
and no action needs to be taken. Unfortunately I'm usually not familiar
enough with qemu to do a full review.

In some cases it might seem like that. Specifically for things where
libvirt isn't impacted such as machine type change because we try to
stay machine type agnostic or for something that we don't use.

On the other hand there were plenty cases where we were impacted and
where we do want to know about these deprecations. It's in fact the
primary reason why this was established after an agreement between qemu
and libvirt projects and in fact I was one of those who argued for
adding such a thing.

As I was one of the proponents I feel obliged to always respond to these
notifications as we've more than once encountered something that in the
end impacted libvirt.

Please do keep sending these to libvirt. It's appreciated to know that
something is going to change! In some cases we don't get a notification
(such as in the recent QAPIfication of netdev-add where non-well-formed
string stopped to be accepted by qemu) and then we have to figure out
only after it trickles down to users.
