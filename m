It's less terse.  Fine with me.  The mix of passive and active voice
feels a bit awkward, though.  Another try:

  All .c should include qemu/osdep.h first.  This script performs three
  related cleanups:

  * Ensure .c files include qemu/osdep.h first.
  * Including it in a .h is redundant, since the .c  already includes
    it.  Drop such inclusions.
  * Likewise, including headers qemu/osdep.h includes is redundant.
    Drop these, too.
