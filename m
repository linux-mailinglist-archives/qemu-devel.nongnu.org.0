Good catch.  I forgot we were going to keep 3.5 support because
of Debian 9.

Now, I'd like to clarify what the wording on our supported build
platforms documentation is supposed to mean for Debian.

The document says:

] For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases, the project will
] aim to support all versions that are not end of life by their respective
] vendors. For the purposes of identifying supported software versions, the
] project will look at Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE distros. Other short-
] lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar software versions.
] 
] For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim to support
] the most recent major version at all times. Support for the previous major
] version will be dropped 2 years after the new major version is released. For
] the purposes of identifying supported software versions, the project will look
] at RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu LTS, and SLES distros. Other long-lifetime distros will
] be assumed to ship similar software versions.

Debian 10 was released in July 2019.  Are we really willing to
support Debian 9 as a supported build platform until July 2021?
The Debian Project itself won't support Debian 9 after July 2020.

Even for other long-lifetime distros, I really think "2 years
after the new major version is released" is too long, and I'd
like to shorten this to 1 year.
