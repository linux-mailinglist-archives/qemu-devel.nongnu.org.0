Thanks - this appears to be your first contribution to qemu.

Typically, the S-o-b should match how you would spell your legal name, 
rather than being a single-word computer user name.

It looks like you threaded another message to this one:
Message-Id: <20200319161925.1818377-2-dnbrdsky@gmail.com>
Subject: [PATCH] lockable: replaced locks with lock guard macros where
  appropriate
but without a 0/2 cover letter, or even a 1/2 or 2/2 indicator on the 
individual patches.  This makes it more likely that the second patch may 
be overlooked by our CI tools.

Since this patch is fixing an issue that just went into the tree 
recently, it would be useful to add mention of that in the commit message:
Fixes: 3284c3ddc4

In fact, using 'lockable:' rather than 'misc:' as your subject prefix 
makes it more obvious that you are fixing an issue in the same area as 
where it was introduced.

That said, the patch itself is correct.

I'll leave it up to the maintainer for this file whether they can 
improve your commit message (although the hardest part of that would be 
knowing a full proper name to use in place of your username), or if you 
will need to send a v2.
