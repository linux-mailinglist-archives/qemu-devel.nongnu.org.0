Also creating symlinks, while nice, is probably added maintainance burden 
because it's something that only needs to be done in in-tree runs so it 
will likely get broken by those using only out of tree. I think getting 
results in a build dir is acceptable (most results are already in some 
subdir at least for system emulation) and just adding convenience Makefile 
is not much complexity while preserving symlinks for build results would 
be so that's probably not much maintenance improvement over current 
situarion.
