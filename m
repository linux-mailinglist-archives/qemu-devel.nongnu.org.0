Having to think twice before doing something we need to do all the time
would slow us down.  I don't think this is going to fly.

QMP is designed to avoid tight coupling of server (i.e. QEMU) and
client.  In particular, we don't want "you have to upgrade both in
lockstep".

A well-behaved client works fine even when it's written for a somewhat
older or newer QMP than the server provides.  "Somewhat" because we
deprecate and eventually remove stuff.  Graceful degradation when the
gap gets too large.

There's a gap between the "lose" wire format, and a "tight" statically
typed internal interface.  The gap exists in QEMU, and we bridge it.
Clients can do the same.  Libvirt does: it provides a statically typed
version of the interface without undue coupling.

Replacing the "lose" wire format by something "tighter" like D-Bus
shrinks the gap.  Good.  It also tightens the coupling.  Bad.
