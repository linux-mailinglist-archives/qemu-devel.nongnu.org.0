Unless we don't use Pipenv :)

I will say I'm open to using tools that aren't Pipenv -- this is just 
something I knew how to use in order to provide a fairly robust 
venv-recreation mechanism, so I am using it. Don't know what I don't 
know, otherwise.

I hear Poetry is nice, but I haven't looked into it yet.

Tox I believe also does venv-management to some extent, though my 
impression of it was that it was less specific about the environments 
than Pipenv was and allowed more wiggle room. Could be wrong.

Pipenv does not manage multiple environments either, unlike Tox, which 
can multiplex your environments for different versions of things. That's 
one point in favor, perhaps.

If you'd like to propose using something else, feel free to fork this 
branch and implement something else; it's probably quicker that way than 
to have me learn tox/poetry/etc.

What I was using Pipenv to solve here is this:

"Create a package list pinned to explicit versions that is not for the 
purpose of installing or using the package, but is for the purpose of 
recreating a precise testing environment. Use this environment to run 
the linters with precisely known tooling versions."

My initial read was that using pip and requirements.txt alone was 
insufficient for this purpose; so I have been using Pipenv for the purpose.

Suggestions/patches welcome.
