I think it's becoming quite clear that having so much duplication (in
the dockerfiles, tests/vm, this playbook, etc) is costly and error
prone.  I don't know if anyone has invested time in a PoC to
consolidate those (with lcitool), but I can certainly see the upside
to that.  BTW, are you volunteering (wink wink)? :)

Right... I wasn't aware of that depedency.  And, this may be a nice
project to make sure that lcitool doesn't have any other libvirt
specificities.

Well, building them during the playbook would be a lot more
complex... You can have your own repo with your own builds, and just
tweak your vars.yml.

It looks like lcitool went the more practical route.  I was hoping to
not have to treat gitlab-runner in such a special way in any
"supported" OS.  What I mean is, I'd rather write the code within
gitlab-runner (or reespective libraries).  Of course, I did not get to
it, so that's why I just documented the steps here.

I'll take a look at lcitool's playbook to see if I can easily
canibalize some of that.  But, at this time, we don't runners for
FreeBSD anyway, so I guess this is not *that* urgent.

This was either a mistake or the installation steps got updated.  I'll
adjust that.

Agreed.  I was not super happy with the current state of this playbook
wrt FreeBSD, but I decided to pick other battles to fight.  Also,
newer gitlab-runner versions *may* be using the updated service
management lib, which may reduce/remove the need for custom handling.

Anyway, I'll look at what can be improved here, considering the cost.

Thanks!
