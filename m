Public bug reported:

When I use qemu on Windows 10 with a French AZERTY keypad with the
correct options the emulated system keypad still QWERTY. If I use sdl it
works fine the emulated keypad is AZERTY.

Example of command with ubuntu live cd:
-> qemu-system-x86_64.exe  -m 4G ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso -display =
gtk -k fr

NOTES:
=C2=A0- Using the same command on Linux works fine. The emulated keypad is =
AZERTY.

Qemu version : 4.2.0 on Windows 10
