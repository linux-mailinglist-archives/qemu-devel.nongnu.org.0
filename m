Public bug reported:

The discussion that led to this bug discovery can be found in this =

mailing list thread:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg05426.html

A workaround for this problem would be to check for page crossings for =

both the user and system modes in the use_goto_tb() function across =

targets. Some targets like "hppa" already implement this fix but others
don't.

To solve the root cause of this problem, the linux-user/mmap.c should =

be fixed to do all the invalidations required. By doing so, up to 6.93% =

performance improvements will be achieved.
