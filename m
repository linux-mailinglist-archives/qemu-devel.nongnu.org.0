I just tried it again it didn't reproduce - all files were there. I
don't have the original tarball that caused me to open this bug, as I
just moved to git clone and continued with that.

Appologies and please close this bug.

Title:
  Cannot build qemu-5.0.0 from tarball

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  Cannot build qemu 5.0.0 from the release tarball. Building from git-
  clone succeeds.

  After downloading and unpacking the 5.0.0 tarball, I typed the
  following:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure

  Then got the following error message:

  ERROR: missing file /home/uri/qemu-5.0.0/ui/keycodemapdb/README

  This is not a GIT checkout but module content appears to
  be missing. Do not use 'git archive' or GitHub download links
  to acquire QEMU source archives. Non-GIT builds are only
  supported with source archives linked from:

    https://www.qemu.org/download/#source

  Developers working with GIT can use scripts/archive-source.sh
  if they need to create valid source archives.

  It appears the ui/keycodemapdb is missing some files that are obtained
  from a git submodule in a git tree.

  Building from a git clone succeeds.
