Public bug reported:

I may have found a bug as when trying to boot up an QEMU VM with the
following command: "qemu-system-mips -M malta -m 512 -hda hda.img
-kernel vmlinux-4.19.0-10-4kc-malta -initrd initrd.img-4.19.0-10-4kc-
malta -append "root=3D/dev/sda1 console=3DttyS0" -nographic -device
e1000,netdev=3Duser.0 -netdev user,id=3Duser.0,hostfwd=3Dtcp::5555-:22 -smp
cores=3D12,threads=3D1,sockets=3D1", it will use up all of the CPU cores on
the host, but not bootup?
