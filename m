Make can build docs/interop/qemu-qmp-ref.{7,html,info,pdf,txt}.  Grab
the .html and go for it.  There's also qmp-ga-ref.

Sadly, this documentation is not nearly as good as it could be.  The doc
comment format is an ad hoc solution to the problem of enabling doc
generation with minimal churn to existing comments.  The doc generator
makes an effort to play that hand (but the hand sucks).  Finally and
most seriously, the doc comments are simply not good enough.

MAINTAINERS blames them on me, but they're effectively unmaintained.
Prerequisite for shipping: having a maintainer who actually gives a
damn.

Let's review them:

* scripts/qmp/qemu-ga-client

  Is anybody using this?

  I think it should be unter "QEMU Guest Agent", not under "QMP".

* scripts/qmp/qmp

  Half-hearted attempt at a CLI tool for sending a QMP command.  Is
  anybody using this?
=20
* scripts/qmp/qmp-shell

  Half-hearted attempt at a human-friendly wrapper around the JSON
  syntax.  I have no use for this myself.

* scripts/qmp/qom-fuse

  I find this occasionally useful for QOM-spelunking.  The need for this
  indicates our QMP interface to QOM is too primitive for such uses.

* scripts/qmp/qom-get
  scripts/qmp/qom-list
  scripts/qmp/qom-set
  scripts/qmp/qom-tree

  Rather specialized.  Is anybody using them?

Currently maintained by Eduardo and Cleber (cc'ed) under "Python
scripts".

Mapping QAPI/QMP commands and events to function signatures isn't hard
(the QAPI code generator does).  Two problems (at least):

1. Leads to some pretty ridiculous functions.  Here's one:

    void qmp_blockdev_mirror(bool has_job_id, const char *job_id,
                             const char *device,
                             const char *target,
                             bool has_replaces, const char *replaces,
                             MirrorSyncMode sync,
                             bool has_speed, int64_t speed,
                             bool has_granularity, uint32_t granularity,
                             bool has_buf_size, int64_t buf_size,
                             bool has_on_source_error,
                             BlockdevOnError on_source_error,
                             bool has_on_target_error, BlockdevOnError on_t=
arget_error,
                             bool has_filter_node_name, const char *filter_=
node_name,
                             bool has_copy_mode, MirrorCopyMode copy_mode,=
=20
                             bool has_auto_finalize, bool auto_finalize,
                             bool has_auto_dismiss, bool auto_dismiss,
                             Error **errp);

  We commonly use 'boxed': true for such beasts, which results in
  functions like this one:

    void qmp_blockdev_add(BlockdevOptions *arg, Error **errp);

2. Many schema changes that are nicely backward compatible in QMP are
   anything but in such an "obvious" C API.  Adding optional arguments,
   for instance, or changing integer type width.  The former is less of
   an issue with 'boxed': true.

Perhaps less of an issue with dynamic languages.

I figure a static language would need much more expressive oomph than C
to be a good target.  No idea how well Go or Rust bindings can work.

Perhaps the libvirt refactoring effort can give us one.

No argument.  There is -readconfig, but it falls way short.

With command line QAPIfication, a real configuration file will be quite
feasible.

The main reason for the lack of progress there is our dedication to
backward compatibility.  A functional replacement of our CLI is a huge
task already.  Throwing in backward compatibility makes it a daunting
one.  Not least because nobody fully understands all the quirks.

I feel we need to make up our minds what kind of interface(s) we want to
provide.

We provide a low-level interface for management applications.  I feel we
need to nail this one.  Its QMP part is okay, I think, the CLI part is
not.

We also try to provide friendlier interfaces for human users.  Not only
do we suck at it, we're also prone to create liabilities for later: much
of the compatibility woes that have been holding us back are rooted in
"convenience" features.  And don't get me started on the folly of us
dabbling in GUI.
