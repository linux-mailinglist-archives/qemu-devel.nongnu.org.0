Since you are listed in the MAINTAINERS file, long-term you'll
eventually use it anyway (i.e. to run the CI pipelines before sending
patches, to subscribe to the 'ACPI' label to get notifications or
comment ACPI-related issues).

The process is quite straight-forward, once having an account you
simply request to be member of the project via the WebUI then you
can help triaging the issues (and closing these two).

Regards,

Phil.
