For things like libvixl, I wonder why this is not a git submodule instead?

For other things that we sync manually, I guess it should be ok to add
the SPDX tags there since the files are likely out of sync anyway.

Yes. I think we have to be very careful here with old files - adding the
tags is likely ok, but e.g. removing the boilerplate text in the various
headers at the same time could be problematic (e.g. the MIT license says
"... this permission notice shall be included in all copies or
substantial portions of the Software")...

Agreed. I'd certainly be interested in helping here, but I currently
don't have time to fully drive this. So if someone has spare time for
this that would be very welcome - otherwise I might have a closer look
at the topics in a couple of weeks or months.
