The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Commit snapshot fails with Permission denied when daemonized

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When running qemu with daemonize option it is impossible to run
  "commit all" in monitor.

  I run qemu 2.7.0 under gentoo 64 bit distribution with following
  command line:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -cpu host -smp 2 -enable-kvm -snapshot \
      -drive file=3Dvm.img,if=3Dvirtio \
      -net nic,model=3Dvirtio,macaddr=3D11:11:11:11:11:11 \
      -net tap,ifname=3Dtap$PORT,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno \
      -vnc :1 -daemonize \
      -chardev vc,id=3Dmon0 -mon chardev=3Dmon0,mode=3Dreadline \
      -chardev socket,id=3Dmon1,host=3Dlocalhost,port=3D10001,server,nowait=
 -mon chardev=3Dmon1,mode=3Dcontrol =


  I connect to vm through VNC viewer and press CTRL+ALT+2 and run "commit a=
ll" command.
  Following error is shown:
  `commit` error for `all`: Permission denied

  When I run my VM without `daemonize` option the command "commit all"
  works without errors.
