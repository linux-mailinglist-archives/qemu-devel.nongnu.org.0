Ok, this is a pretty compelling motivating factor for dropping
3.6, as it is clear demonstration that we're being held back
by the unfortunate lack of runtime compatibility.

For most of the other problems we can simply mandate a new
enough version of the add on tool, but if using new mypy
requires annotations that break at runtime on 3.6 that's
a painful blocker.
