We have some compatibility advice buried in sections "Enumeration
types" and "Struct types".  Compatibility is actually about commands
and events.  It devolves to the types used there.  All kinds of types,
not just enumerations and structs.

Replace the existing advice by a new section "Compatibility
considerations".

+
+Maintaining backward compatibility at the Client JSON Protocol level
+while evolving the schema requires some care.  This section is about
+syntactic compatibility.  Necessary, but not sufficient for actual
+compatibility.
+
+Clients send commands with argument data, and receive command
+responses with return data and events with event data.
+
+Adding opt-in functionality to the send direction is backwards
+compatible: adding commands, optional arguments, enumeration values,
+union and alternate branches; turning an argument type into an
+alternate of that type; making mandatory arguments optional.  Clients
+oblivious of the new functionality continue to work.
+
+Incompatible changes include removing commands, command arguments,
+enumeration values, union and alternate branches, adding mandatory
+command arguments, and making optional arguments mandatory.
+
+The specified behavior of an absent optional argument should remain
+the same.  With proper documentation, this policy still allows some
+flexibility; for example, when an optional 'buffer-size' argument is
+specified to default to a sensible buffer size, the actual default
+value can still be changed.  The specified default behavior is not the
+exact size of the buffer, only that the default size is sensible.
+
+Adding functionality to the receive direction is generally backwards
+compatible: adding events, adding return and event data members.
+Clients are expected to ignore the ones they don't know.
+
+Removing "unreachable" stuff like events that can't be triggered
+anymore, optional return or event data members that can't be sent
+anymore, and return or event data member (enumeration) values that
+can't be sent anymore makes no difference to clients, except for
+introspection.  The latter can conceivably confuse clients, so tread
+carefully.
+
+Incompatible changes include removing return and event data members.
+
+Any change to a command definition's 'data' or one of the types used
+there (recursively) needs to consider send direction compatibility.
+
+Any change to a command definition's 'return', an event definition's
+'data', or one of the types used there (recursively) needs to consider
+receive direction compatibility.
+
+Any change to types used in both contexts need to consider both.
+
+Members of enumeration types, complex types and alternate types may be
+reordered freely.  For enumerations and alternate types, this doesn't
+affect the wire encoding.  For complex types, this might make the
+implementation emit JSON object members in a different order, which
+the Client JSON Protocol permits.
