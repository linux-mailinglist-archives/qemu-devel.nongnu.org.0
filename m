Having QEMU or any other tooling rely on undocumented on-disk format
specifics of zipl is definitely wrong and prone to break with the next
change. This is _not_ an ABI.

BOOT_IMAGE on s390 currently only exists for DASD, so any tooling that
relies on it today would be broken for SCSI boot. The equivalent
information for SCSI would be the boot program selector at
/sys/firmware/ipl/bootprog. There is currently no other way to get this
information when booting from DASD.

Also note that the format of BOOT_IMAGE is dependent on the boot loader
that created it. The use of the menu number (and 0 for default) has the
advantage that this number can be used, e.g. to select the same number
for the next boot using the LOADPARM. Changing BOOT_IMAGE to show the
kernel name would take away that use case.

At this time I would suggest to start by identifying any current users
of BOOT_IMAGE and to understand what their actual requirement is. Once
that information is available, we can think about how this requirement
could best be implemented. Looking at the dracut link it seems like
their requirement cannot be met at all with the information currently
provided on s390 via the BOOT_IMAGE parameter.
