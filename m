nit: the KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_DABT comment is unnecessary

Missing {} around the outer block.

As KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_EXT_DABT is a VM capability then I think we should
set cap_has_inject_ext_dabt here, like cap_has_mp_state gets set. I see
you've followed the pattern used for cap_has_inject_serror_esr, but that
looks wrong too since KVM_CAP_ARM_INJECT_SERROR_ESR is also a VM
capability. The way it is now we just keep setting
cap_has_inject_serror_esr to the same value, NR_VCPUS times.

afaict from Documentation/virt/kvm/api.txt and the KVM code you cannot
get this state. Therefore the above line (and extra stray blank line)
should be dropped.

This doesn't seem like the right thing to do. What happens on real
hardware in this case? If an OS would get into a "vicious cycle" on
real hardware then it should get into one on KVM too.

ins_addr should be declared above

But what are we doing? pc is a guest virtual address. Oh, I see...

... we're trying to actual walk the KVM guest's page tables. That
seems a bit odd, and the "_debug" function name used for it makes
it seem even more odd.

The guest shouldn't be able to generate three lines of errors on the host
whenever it wants. That's a security bug. One trace point here seems like
the most we should do. Or, after these three lines we should kill the
guest.

Actually, I don't think we should attempt to get the instruction at all.
We should do what the KVM documenation suggests we do when we get
this exit. We should either do a user selected action: one of suspend,
dump, restart, or inject a dabt (as is done below). The last choice hopes
that the guest will handle it in some graceful way, or that it'll crash
with all the information needed for a post-mortem crash investigation.

And I don't think we should do the "very brave" option of trying to
emulate the instruction, even if we identify it as a valid MMIO address.
That just sounds like a huge can of worms.

Does QEMU already have a way for users to select a
don't-know-how-to-handle-guest-exception behavior?
