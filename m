I'm not sure to see how setting a minimum msize of 4096 at Tversion would
prevent the client to pass a higher 'count' argument and lure the server
into generating a bigger than msize response since it does not check
count < msize - 11 without patch 3.

Good to know for ReiserFS.

Ahh I now understand at last your argument about Rreaddir loosing data.
We may end up sending { Rreaddir count=0 } because the next entry is too
large... and thus end the readdir sequence. Mentioning this explicitly
from the start would have been more clear for me ;-)

This looks like yet another bug to me. It looks wrong to return this
special response if we have more entries to go. Also this could be the
client's _fault_ if it provides a ridiculously small value for count.
The current code will return count=0 all the same.

In any case, I think v9fs_do_readdir() should only return 0 if there
are no more entries to read. It should error out otherwise, but I'm
not sure how...

We still don't understand each other I'm afraid... we actually have
implicit 'msize' checks already for every single thing we write on
the wire: v9fs_packunpack() which detects when we're trying to write
passed the buffer. When this happens, it is propagated to the transport
which then disconnects, which is the painful thing you've been
experiencing with your readdir experiments. In the case of Rreaddir, it
really does make sense to try to avoid the disconnection like you do in
patch 3 because the readdir sequence allows _partial_ reads. Same goes
for Rread. But that's it. No other message in the protocol allows that,
so I've never thought of adding individual 'msize' checks anywhere else.
What would they do better than v9fs_packunpack() already does ?
