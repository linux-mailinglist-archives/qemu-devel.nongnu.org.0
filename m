Dirty page tracking is consolidated at the vfio container level.
Userspace has no basis for determining or interface for selecting a
dirty bitmap provider, so I would disagree that QEMU should play any
role here.  The container dirty bitmap tries to provide the finest
granularity available based on the support of all the devices/groups
managed by the container.  If there are groups attached to the
container that have not participated in page pinning, then we consider
all DMA mappings within the container as persistently dirty.  Once all
of the participants subscribe to page pinning, the dirty scope is
reduced to the pinned pages.  IOMMU support for dirty page logging would
introduce finer granularity yet, which we would probably prefer over
page pinning, but interfaces for this have not been devised.

Ideally userspace should be unaware of any of this, the benefit would
be seen transparently by having a more sparsely filled dirty bitmap,
which more accurately reflects how memory is actually being dirtied.
Thanks,

Alex
