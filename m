Do you have a list of features that were not in the ABI document
but were included in the CPU models you've added?  What exactly
make them important enough for us, but not important enough for
the ABI level specification writers?


In patch 2/3 you wrote:

| Historically we've found that defining CPU models with an arbitrary
| combination of CPU features can be problematic, as some guest OS
| will not check all features they use, and instead assume that if
| they see feature "XX", then "YY" will always exist. This is reasonable
| in bare metal, but subject to breakage in virtualization.

Do we know how likely that is?  Any examples where this has
happened?

What if we simply used the raw list of features from the
specification, add those as CPU models experimentally, and let
people report issues if they find them?  Too risky?  Not useful
in practice?

Maybe we could provide both a "x86-64-abiNN" and a
"x86-64-abiNN-minimal" CPU model.  We could even use the -minimal
CPU model definition to write a test case that ensure the
algorithm you describe below is always being followed.  The name
should make it clear that the CPU model is more conservative but
less likely to be useful.

If no AMD CPU model satisfy v4 yet, maybe we should avoid adding
any feature that is not present in any known AMD CPUs, unless
they are already required by the ABI level specification.
Otherwise, the list is likely to contain Intel features that AMD
has no plans to implement at all.

Or maybe we should just refrain from adding a x86-64-abi4 CPU
model until we have a CPU model from AMD that satisfies v4.

I don't get this part.  Why can't the CPU model include a VMX
feature set that is the LCD of the VMX-capable CPUs that satisfy
abiNN?  The VMX feature set is supposed to be just a default when
using vmx=on.

That's the biggest caveat for me.

I believe the default should prioritize safety.  I believe you
implicitly established that runnability is not an absolute
requirement when you added features that are required by the ABI
level specification.

I would prefer to address the problem of poor defaults the
following way:

- We should start requiring management software to pass a explicit
  live-migration-policy argument if live migration needs to work
  (after documenting that and waiting for the deprecation period,
  of course).
- If live migration is not required, we can default to host
  passthrough.
- If live migration is required, we should stop providing a
  default CPU model, and requiring it to be configured
  explicitly.

QEMU doesn't have enough information to choose a good CPU model
default when live migration is required.  Even if we add the
x86-64-abiNN CPU models in this series, we have no way to decide
if abi1, abi2, abi3, or abi4 is a better default, do we?

That doesn't mean the CPU models you are adding aren't useful.
They may still be useful for management software or for
downstream vendors to choose their own defaults.
