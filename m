My understanding is that XFS and ext4 behave very similar in this
respect. It's not a clear loss on XFS either, some cases are improved.
But cases that get a performance regression exist, too. It's a question
of the workload, the file system state (e.g. fragmentation of the image
file) and the storage.

So I don't think checking for a specific filesystem is going to improve
things.

Hm, this feels wrong. Doing more operations should never be faster than
doing less operations.

Maybe the difference is in allocating 64k at once instead of doing a
separate allocation for every 4k block? But with the extent size hint
patches to file-posix, we should allocate 1 MB at once by default now
(if your test image was newly created). Can you check whether this is in
effect for your image file?
