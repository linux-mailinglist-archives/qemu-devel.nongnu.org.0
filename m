Ah I see now, these aliases are for individual properties rather than objects. What I
was trying to ask was if it were possible to have something like this:

/machine (SS-5-machine)
  /builtin
    /nic0 -> link to "lance" device

Here nic0 is an alias "published" by the maintainer of the SS-5 machine which is
configured in the machine init() function using object_property_add_link() or a
suitable wrapper. Users can then configure these builtin devices from the command
line using your -machine nic0.netdev=my-netdev-id syntax or similar.

Having the default devices under /builtin or other known QOM path would enable
builtin devices to be easily enumerated programatically and/or from the command line
as required.


ATB,

Mark.
