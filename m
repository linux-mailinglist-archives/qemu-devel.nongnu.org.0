Hi All,

We=E2=80=99re pleased to announce the first Open ISA miniconf at linux.conf=
.au

Open Instruction Set Architectures like RISC-V, OpenPOWER and others are
the next step in the evolution of Open Hardware.  The mini-conference
will commence with a brief overview of Open ISAs in general.

It will then introduce the two most common open ISAs, RISC-V and
OpenPOWER. This will include an overview of the ISAs, how they are
supported and why people should use them. Finally we will delve straight
into a set of curated presentations from across the Open ISA ecosystem.

The miniconf organisers, Alistair Francis and Hugh Blemings along with
the LCA 2020 team invite proposals for sessions in the Open ISA miniconf
of either 15 or 30 minutes duration.  Suggested topics include Linux
kernel support for open ISAs, RISC-V, Open POWER and any other Open ISA
related topics.  As befits LCA, sessions should have a strong technical
emphasis rather than marketing/sales focus.

Places are limited in the miniconf schedule and early submission of your
proposal will assist our planning.  The Call for Sessions formally
closes on December 8th.

For attendees - the miniconf promises a great deal of technical depth
and breadth across this relatively new aspect of the open technical
commons, we look forward to seeing you!

As an extra plus it's on the beautiful Gold Coast in the middle of Summer :=

Registration and details are available at:
https://linux.conf.au/programme/miniconfs/open-isa/

And don't forget there's a bunch of other awesome miniconfs scheduled
for LCA 2020 - the complete list is available here -
https://linux.conf.au/programme/miniconfs/

We look forward to seeing you!

Regards,
Hugh Blemings & Alistair Francis
