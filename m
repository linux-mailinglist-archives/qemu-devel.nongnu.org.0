I'm talking about cases where you don't explicitly set an option for a
child, but it inherits the (possibly changed) option from its parent.

For example, consider a qcow2 image that was originally opened as a
backing file, so both its qcow2 node and its file-posix node are
read-only; the file-posix node inherits its read-only=3Don setting from
the qcow2 node. Now you reopen the qcow2 node read-write (starting a
commit job) and the expected result is that the file-posix node
automatically inherits the updated value and becomes read-write, too.

This happens indeed in bdrv_reopen_queue_child(), but the interesting
case is where an option isn't explicitly set in the recursive call for
the child node. This happens in the following line in the nested call:

    role->inherit_options(&flags, options, parent_flags, parent_options);

If child->bs->inherits_from didn't point to the parent that is being
reopened, we wouldn't even recurse, so .inherit_options would never be
called.

You do reopen on a single node that could be way up the graph, not
really related to the job. The question is what this reopen can do to
the subtree below it, including the job filter.

Fair enough (though I'm not completely convinced that a filter job
somewhere down the tree can reasonably block all of its parent nodes
=66rom being reopened), but at the very least we must make sure that
reopen actually does report an error instead of returning success and
silently ignoring the subtrees that contain filter nodes.

Hm, okay. Maybe it's actually not possible. I'd have to have a closer
look at the code.

Yeah, let's see if we can improve the situation a bit at least for 4.1.
