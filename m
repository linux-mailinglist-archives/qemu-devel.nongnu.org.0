After looking at cpu_hotplug_rd(), I think I know what's going on.

Every time command 0 is written, and there is no CPU with pending
events, the command data register will read as 0!

This seems like a core piece of information, and it's not documented in
the text file anywhere. It only says (with patch#1 applied),

  in case of error or unsupported command reads is 0x0

Command 0 is *not* unsupported. Therefore, this documentation is only
self-consistent if:

- selecting a non-existent (>=max_cpus) CPU via the selector register is
an *error*

- asking for a CPU with pending events (with command 0x0), and finding
none, is also an *error*.

Let me re-read the patch set with this information in mind.

Thanks
Laszlo
