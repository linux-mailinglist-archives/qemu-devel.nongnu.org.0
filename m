I tend to agree - while people may work on kernel code, plenty do not
work on kernel code & QEMU is not following kernel code pratices more
generally. I think it is more compelling to align with glib given that
it is a core part of QEMU codebase. I'd much rather QEMU more closely
align with glib and increasingly drop stuff that QEMU has reinvented
in favour of using GLib features. For example I could see GObject as
a  base for QOM in future, and typedefs are a normal practice in this
case.

Daniel
