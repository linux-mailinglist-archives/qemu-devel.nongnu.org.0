QMP only.  The QAPI schema does not use JSON numbers at all so far.

QAPI schema only.  QMP does not support comments.

Every single string in the QAPI schema uses them, though.

I have no idea why Anthony put them in the QAPI schema language.

We could remove them from the QAPI schema language.  Flag day, and
git-blame becomes pretty much useless for a couple of years.

Removing them from QMP would be painless for QEMU itself, but could
upset QMP clients that (unwisely) use them.

Let me reiterate that parsing the lower layer of the QAPI schema
language is the trivial part (because we made it trivial, accepting a
considerable hit to ergonomics).  For basic editor support, parsing the
lower layer is all you need.  But to truly work with the schema, you
need to grok the (less than trivial!) upper layer.  Making the lower
layer slightly more trivial is not going to help with that.

We can of course indulge in buyer's remorse on our choice to develop our
own schema language for QAPI.  But that's separate discussion.

As long as we have our own QAPI schema language, we should use a single
frontend for working with it.

Falls apart for # comments.  JavaScript uses // and /* */.
