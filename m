I didn't manage to find a definite answer in spec to what SMBIOS entry
should describe. Another use of 'Physical Memory Component' is in PMTT
table and it looks to me that it type 17 should reffer to DIMM device.

But well, considering spec isn't clear about subject and that linux
kernel doesn't seem to use this entries lets use it without SMBIOS
entries for now. Like you suggested, lets set number of SMBIOS handles to 0
and drop num_smbios_handles so that user won't be able to provide any.
