Maybe there should be a special award for the non-intuitive 
ndctl create-namespace command (modifies existing namespace and might create
a different empty one...) I'm sure there is some interesting history behind that one :)

Upshot is I just threw a filesystem on fsdax and wrote some text files on it
to allow easy grepping. The right data ends up in the memory and a plausible
namespace description is stored in the LSA.

So to some degree at least it's 'working' on an 8 way direct connected
set of emulated devices.

One snag is that serial number support isn't yet upstream in QEMU.
(I have had it in my tree for a while but not posted it yet because of
 QEMU feature freeze)
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commit/144c783ea8a5fbe169f46ea1ba92940157f42733
That's needed for meaningful cookie generation.  Otherwise you can build the
namespace once, but it won't work on next probe as the cookie is 0 and you
hit some error paths.

Maybe sensible to add a sanity check and fail namespace creation if
cookie is 0?  (Silly side question, but is there a theoretical risk of
a serial number / other data combination leading to a fletcher64()
checksum that happens to be 0 - that would give a very odd bug report!)

So to make it work the following is needed:

1) The kernel fix for mailbox buffer overflow.
2) Qemu fix for size of arguements for get_lsa
3) Qemu fix to allow variable size input arguements (for set_lsa)
4) Serial number patch above + command lines to qemu to set appropriate
   serial numbers.

I'll send out the QEMU fixes shortly and post the Serial number patch,
though that almost certainly won't go in until next QEMU development
cycle starts in a few weeks.

Next up, run through same tests on some other topologies.
