Nodes are implicit if they haven=E2=80=99t been added consciously by the =
user.
A node added by a block job can be non-implicit, too, as mirror shows;
If the user specifies the filter-node-name option, they will know about
the node, thus it is no longer implicit.

If the user doesn=E2=80=99t know about the node (they didn=E2=80=99t give=
 the
filter-node-name option), the node is implicit.

Hm, well, what=E2=80=99s the reason not to do it?
Also, there are not only guest flushes.  bdrv_flush_all() exists, which
is called when the guest is stopped.  So who is going to flush the
target if not its parent?

Is it?  First of all, this filter doesn=E2=80=99t care.  It doesn=E2=80=99=
t even read
from the target (related note: we probably don=E2=80=99t need CONSISTENT_=
READ on
the target).

Second, there is generally going to be a parent on backup-top that has
the WRITE permission taken.  So this does not really effectively reduce
that number of cases.

But we will do it still, won=E2=80=99t we?

(If an unchanging write comes in, this driver will handle it just like a
normal write, will it not?)

Not really if it isn=E2=80=99t a usable block driver yet, no.
