It depends on the user / app / deployment scenario. In OpenStack alot of
work was done to beef up security between services on the mgmt network,
with TLS encryption as standard to reduce attack vectors.

IIUC, you have to set these flags upfront when you launch QEMU, or
hotplug the device using the feature. When something gets stuck,
and you issue the "yank" command, then everything that has the flag
enabled gets torn down. So in practice it looks like the flag will
get enabled for everything at QEMU startup, and yanking down tear
down everything.

Yes, the migrate_cancel is an example of a more fine grained way to
recover. I was thinking that we need an equivalent fine control knob
for NBD too.

That way if QEMU does get stuck, you can start by tearing down the
least distruptive channel. eg try tearing down the migration connection
first (which shouldn't negatively impact the guest), and only if that
doesn't work then, move on to tear down the NBD connection (which risks
data loss)

Daniel
