Hm.  Part of my point was that this still happens all the time.

Which is why I=E2=80=99d prefer more tests to run in CI than a handful of=
 not
very useful ones in make check.

(Of course, running it in a CI won=E2=80=99t prevent iotest failures on y=
our
machine, but in practice neither does the current model.)

This is not a game, I=E2=80=99m talking purely from my standpoint:
(I talked wrongly, but more on that below)

Whenever make check fails, it=E2=80=99s urgent.  Without iotests running =
in make
check, we had some time to sort the situation out.  That=E2=80=99s no lon=
ger the
case.

That means we need to take care of everything immediately.  And I purely
want help with that.  I just did not have the impression that such help
was there in the past months.
(This impression may or may not have a correlation to reality.)

I thought that was just because nobody really cared about the iotests in
make check.  Now you say you do, so that=E2=80=99s why I said you should =
NACK
the revert and then I know that I can count on your help.


Now where I was wrong: I didn=E2=80=99t say =E2=80=9Cyour help=E2=80=9D b=
ut =E2=80=9Cyou handle it=E2=80=9D.
That was wrong.  I=E2=80=99m sorry.  That would mean I reap all the benef=
its and
you have to pay the price.


What I=E2=80=99m not so sure of is why you didn=E2=80=99t just say that=E2=
=80=99s unfair and
instead reply with an impossible suggestion.  That makes it a bit
difficult for me to find out exactly what you plan to do.

I take your point as =E2=80=9CExactly, this suggestion would be impossibl=
e.
With the tests in make check, the worst that happens is CI breakage and
rejected pull requests, and dealing with those is very much possible.=E2=80=
=9D[1]

As I=E2=80=99ve said, my POV is different, because I find CI breakage, ma=
ke
check breakage, and rejected pull requests to be worse because those are
failures on other people=E2=80=99s machines.  That puts me personally und=
er much
more stress than failures on my own machine.  But it seems that you feel
differently.

[1] Or maybe you wanted to say that you find a rare intermittent failure
that slips into make check less worse than 100 % failure of some test
for everyone who runs the iotests.  I don=E2=80=99t know.
I know that the 100 % failures are annoying but generally easily fixed;
whereas the intermittent ones are the ones that stick and hard to fix.
And those intermittent ones are unlikely to cause pull requests to be
rejected.

You should really know I=E2=80=99m all for that and that I=E2=80=99ve don=
e my share of
work there.

But from my perspective we=E2=80=99ve said and tried that for six years a=
nd we
aren=E2=80=99t there still.  So to me =E2=80=9CWe should just fix it=E2=80=
=9D of course sounds
correct, but I also don=E2=80=99t believe it=E2=80=99ll happen any time s=
oon.  Mostly
because we generally don=E2=80=99t know what to fix before it breaks, but=
 also
because that=E2=80=99s exactly what we=E2=80=99ve tried to do for at leas=
t six years.


So, hm.  I don=E2=80=99t quite know where we=E2=80=99re going.

I still think that I personally would prefer the iotests to not run as
part of make check, but just as CI.

You do have a point that dropping the iotests from make check would
benefit me at your expense.  (Well, it=E2=80=99d be the same result for b=
oth of
us, it just appears that we have different perceptions of pain.)

OTOH, keeping the iotests in make check means we have to act on failure
reports immediately.  For example, someone=E2=84=A2 needs to investigate =
the 130
failure Peter has reported.  I=E2=80=99ve just replied =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=
=99t know=E2=80=9D, CC=E2=80=99d
Thomas, and waited whether anyone else would do anything.  Nobody did,
and that can=E2=80=99t work.  (I also wrote that I wouldn=E2=80=99t act o=
n it, precisely
because I didn=E2=80=99t see the point.  I assumed that if anyone disagre=
ed with
that statement, they would have said something.)

So acting on such reports means pain, too.  I consider it greater than
the previous kind of pain, because I prefer =E2=80=9CThis sucks, I=E2=80=99=
ll have to
fix it this week or so=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9COh crap, I=E2=80=99ll have to=
 investigate now,
reproduce it, write an email as soon as possible, and fix it=E2=80=9D.

But at least we=E2=80=99ll all have this pain as long as we share it.  An=
d then
it might not be so bad.
