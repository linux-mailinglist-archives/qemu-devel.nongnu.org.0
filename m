If the QEMU header files all contain #includes for the
system headers they rely on, then when tools are validating
code in the header, they can stand a better chance of being
able to resolve all the types. Though it'll still fail if
some of the system header pieces only get exposed as a result
of config-host.h macros, but that's relatively few, compared
to today where amost nothing resolves if yuo validate the
headers files in isolation.

Yeah, its not entirely straightforward, though our CI will catch
that on our most important target platforms.
