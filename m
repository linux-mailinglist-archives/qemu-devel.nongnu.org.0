I don't see the difference. From kernel perspective they are all 
userspace drivers regardless whether it's a guest or not. No matter how 
many levels in the middle, there will always be a final endpoint that 
know clearly about the semantics of the BAR. The intermediate level just 
transports the uAPI to upper levels.

Obviously, for device that has higher level of abstraction like virtio, 
using a bus level device model for migration is a burden.

Any reason for such replication? Except for the devices that have well 
known interface like virtio, each device should have unique 
attributes/behaviors that needs to be dealt with during live migration.

So this just answer my question. It's not hard to forecast Qemu may end 
up with similar pressure in the future. The request is simple, connect a 
guest with a vendor specific proprietary uAPI.

VFIO user is not the first, vhost-user can do this already. I would 
rather consider VFIO-user to cover the case that vhost-user can't cover. 
And if possible, we should encourage to use vhost-user.

So it looks like vendor needs to implement their own migration protocol 
instead of the well defined ones in qemu? I think migration guys may 
share more experiences of how challenge it would be.

One thing that is missed in this summary is the way to detect migration 
compatibility. We can't not simply depend on migration failure I guess.

Well, it should be sufficient if the opaque uAPI itself is against the 
Linux uAPI/ABI design principles. The side effect is obvious, 
maintainability, debug-ability and compatibility.

I don't get here, why proposing alternative is not helpful consider 
we're in the early stage?

That's complete different, for guest memory, it's:

1) not read from any uAPI
2) not opaque for guest itself

But what qemu expect to read from VFIO uAPI is completely opaque to any 
of the upper layer.

Thanks
