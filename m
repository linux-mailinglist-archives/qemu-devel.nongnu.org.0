I can't remember the details but I think I've had no tswap in sam460ex 
first but that did not work and had to add it but I've probably looked at 
other examples and did not really understand why this was needed. I tested 
on x86_64 so not matching host. The board firmware has some reference to 
this magic value in:

qemu/roms/u-boot-sam460ex/arch/powerpc/lib/bootm.c::boot_jump_linux()

I don't know what it does with it but I think kernel expects it in big 
endian and what we put there should match what U-Boor does (if this is 
actually used on sam460ex which I'm not sure about). The Linux kernel I've 
tested with back then was probably from Ubuntu_16.04 or Debian Jessie 
which supported this board. Not sure this helps but that's all I can 
gather now but I may remember wrong.
