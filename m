Maybe, but I didn't write or review how x86 does their default map, so I
don't know.

You could create your own map and then switch to it. See lib/arm/asm/mmu-=
api.h

But, you don't have to switch the whole map to use non-identity mapped
addresses. Just create new virt mappings to the phys addresses you're
interested in, and then use those new virt addresses instead. If you're
worried that somewhere an identity mapped virt address is getting used
because of a phys/virt address mix up, then you could probably sprinkle
some assert(virt_to_phys(addr) !=3D addr)'s around to ensure it.
