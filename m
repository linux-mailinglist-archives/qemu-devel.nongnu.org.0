Hi Alex
Got it!
Thanks for reminding of this. And as now we have vfio-pci implementing
vendor ops to allow live migration of pass-through devices, is it
necessary to implement similar sysfs node for those devices?
or do you think just PCI IDs of those devices are enough for libvirt to
know device compatibility ?

Thanks
Yan
