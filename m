This series adds a new "BITMAP" sync mode that is meant to replace the
existing "INCREMENTAL" sync mode.

This mode can be changed by issuing any of three bitmap sync modes;
passed as arguments to the job.

The three bitmap sync modes are:
- CONDITIONAL: This is an alias for the old incremental mode. The bitmap =
is
               conditionally synchronized based on the return code of the=
 job
               upon completion.
- NEVER: This is, effectively, the differential backup mode. It never cle=
ars
         the bitmap, as the name suggests.
- ALWAYS: Here is the new, exciting thing. The bitmap is always synchroni=
zed,
          even on failure. On success, this is identical to incremental, =
but
          on failure it clears only the bits that were copied successfull=
y.
          This can be used to "resume" incremental backups from later poi=
nts
          in times.

I wrote this series by accident on my way to implement incremental mode
for mirror, but this happened first -- the problem is that Mirror mode
uses its existing modes in a very particular way; and this was the best
way to add bitmap support into the mirror job properly.

In this series:
patches 1-2: Adds CONDITIONAL
patch 3: Adds NEVER
Patches 4-7: Adds ALWAYS.
Patches 8-11: Adds iotest 257
Patch 12: Minor permission loosening for RO bitmaps.

Next up:
 - Add these modes to Mirror. (Done*, but need tests.)
 - Allow the use of bitmaps and bitmap sync modes with non-BITMAP modes;
   This will allow for resumable/re-tryable full backups.

John Snow (12):
  qapi: add BitmapSyncMode enum
  block/backup: Add mirror sync mode 'bitmap'
  block/backup: add 'never' policy to bitmap sync mode
  hbitmap: Fix merge when b is empty, and result is not an alias of a
  hbitmap: enable merging across granularities
  block/dirty-bitmap: add bdrv_dirty_bitmap_claim
  block/backup: add 'always' bitmap sync policy
  iotests: add testing shim for script-style python tests
  iotests: teach run_job to cancel pending jobs
  iotests: teach FilePath to produce multiple paths
  iotests: add test 257 for bitmap-mode backups
  block/backup: loosen restriction on readonly bitmaps
