Dependencies need some kind of connection.

In the physical world, connections are a scarce resource.  This leads to
somewhat regular dependencies.  Reset order follows wiring.  The wiring
isn't always a tree, but it's tree-like enough to make trees a useful
concept there.

In the virtual world, connections aren't scarce; we can create
dependencies between anything.  Some dependencies, however, are just
sloppy modelling.

As your [*] explains, this is an artifact of sloppy modelling.

Yes, implicit dependencies are brittle.  One of the reasons why making
them explicit can be worthwhile.

After all these years, the transition to qdev is still incomplete, and
the incompleteness still bogs us down.

We don't even know what still needs to be converted.  If we had a list
of such device models, and which machines depend on them, we could apply
a bit more force to the problem.

Wonderfully unsubtle failure!  Even the stupidest of smoke tests should
catch it.

Would you be willing to hazard a guess on the risk of creating bugs
subtle enough to survive basic smoke tests?

Concur.

On a green field, we'd perhaps create things so that these buses can be
children of machines.  But our field looks quite ploughed.
