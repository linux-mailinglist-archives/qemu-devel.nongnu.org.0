Hello Philippe,

happy new year,

I am going back to look at the current code in master, slowly trying to get back a hold on things,
and I remember some time ago you suggested to keep testing "tools" builds,

with

./configure --disable-tcg --disable-kvm --enable-tools

but the drawback of the "tools-only" build is that currently one cannot run make check on it.

It fails with ERRORS in bios-tables-test and others.

Is it supposed to actually work? Is there any make check work that can be done without any accelerator?
I would assume so...

Thanks,

Claudio
