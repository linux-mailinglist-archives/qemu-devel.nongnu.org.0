Well, I suppose =E2=80=9Cdealing with=E2=80=9D means =E2=80=9Cif (encrypted=

duplicating that doesn=E2=80=99t seem too bad.

Hm, OK.  Not sure if that place would look worse with two function

Well, usually, the effort is minimal, but OK.

So it must be less expensive than an arbitrarily complex loop.  I think
a single SEEK_DATA/HOLE call was something like O(n) on tmpfs?

What I=E2=80=99m trying to say is that this is not a good limit and can mea=
n
anything.

I do think this limit definition makes sense for callers that want to
know about ZERO_OPEN.  But I don=E2=80=99t know why we would have to let ot=
her
callers wait, too.

Hm, yes.  I was thinking of parallels, but that only checks once in
parallels_open(), so it=E2=80=99s OK.

I didn=E2=80=99t say the block layer, but it if makes sense.

It definitely doesn=E2=80=99t make sense to me to do that call unconditiona=
lly
in bdrv_co_open().

I=E2=80=99m very skeptical of that.  BDI already has the problem that it do=
esn=E2=80=99t
know which of the information the caller actually wants and that it is
sometimes used in a quasi-hot path.

Maybe that means it is indeed time to incorporate it into BDI, but the
caller should have a way of specifying what parts of BDI it actually
needs and then drivers can skip anything that isn=E2=80=99t trivially obtai=
nable
that the caller doesn=E2=80=99t need.

I=E2=80=99m as hesitant as ever to give a review that this notion is useful=
,
because I haven=E2=80=99t seen a practical example yet where the problem is=
n=E2=80=99t
the fact that NBD doesn=E2=80=99t have 64-bit write_zeroes support.

So far, it looks to me like this notion is only really useful for cases
where we expect a management layer on top of qemu anyway.  And then I=E2=80=
=99m
not sure that this new feature works reliably enough for such a
management layer.

(I=E2=80=99m not saying it isn=E2=80=99t useful.  Again, intuitively it doe=
s seem
useful.  Intuition can be enough to merge a sufficiently simple series
that doesn=E2=80=99t increase code complexity too much.  But I=E2=80=99m st=
ill asking
for actual practical examples, because that would make a better
argument, of course.)
