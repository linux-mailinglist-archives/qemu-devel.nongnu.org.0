Two things here:
- vcpus:  If you want migration to consume all the bandwidth, you are
  happy with it using more vcpus.
- bandwidth: It will only consume only the one that the guest has
  assigned, split (we hope evenly) between all the channels.

My main reason to have a higher number of channels is:
- test better the code with more than one channel
- work "magically" well in all scenarios.  With a low number of
  channels, we are not going to be able to saturate a big network pipe.

Yeap.  This is the default bandwidth.

#define MAX_THROTTLE  (32 << 20)

What does libvirt does today for this value?

I agree here, they should don't care by default.

In my opinion, we should have something like:
- multifd: enabled by default
- max downtime: 300 ms (current) looks right to me
- max bandwidth: 32MB/s (current) seems a bit low. 100MB/s (i.e. almost
  full gigabit ethernet) seems reasonable to me.  Having a default for
  10Gigabit ethernet or similar seems too high.

Will start another series with the current values to discuss all the
defaults, ok?

thanks for the comments, Juan.
