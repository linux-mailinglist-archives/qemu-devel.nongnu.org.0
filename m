Hi Eric,

These patches are extremely welcome! I took over the KVM SPE patches from Andrew
Murray, and I was working on something similar to help with development.

The KVM series on the public mailing list work only by chance because it is
impossible to reliably map the SPE buffer at EL2 when profiling triggers a stage 2
data abort. That's because the DABT is reported asynchronously via the buffer
management interrupt and the faulting IPA is not reported anywhere. I'm trying to
fix this issue in the next iteration of the series, and then I'll come back to
your patches for review and testing.

Thanks,

Alex
