This sounds like you don=E2=80=99t care about adding another bug when it me=
ans
fixing this bug.  I do care.  And so all I was saying is that it seemed
problematic to me to fix the problem in this way, because clearly this
would make block_resize block the monitor in some cases and clearly that
would be a problem, if not a bug.

(And that=E2=80=99s precisely what can be said about the current block_resi=
ze
behavior of revealing previous backing file data: It is a problem, but I
wouldn=E2=80=99t call it a full-on bug.  It just seems to me that nobody ha=
s
ever really thought about it.)

Also, I don=E2=80=99t see this as a really pressing issue for block_resize =
at
least, because this isn=E2=80=99t a recent regression or anything.  It was =
just
the behavior we had, I believe everyone knew it, we just never thought
about whether it really is the best kind of behavior.  So, yes, I=E2=80=99m=
 in
absolutely no hurry to fix this for block_resize.  (Commit is a
different story, but then again commit is a job already, so it doesn=E2=80=
=99t
suffer from the blocking issue.)


But of course this wasn=E2=80=99t all that you=E2=80=99re saying, you give =
a very good
point next.

Discarding cropped clusters when shrinking is a good point.  I didn=E2=80=
=99t
think of that.  So block_resize already has the very problem I was
afraid you=E2=80=99d introduce, because of course discarding isn=E2=80=99t =
very
different from quick-zeroing.

Hm.  I don=E2=80=99t feel that bad about disallowing this edge case (growin=
g a
shrunken overlay) for potentially all non-qcow2v3 formats.  I don=E2=80=99t=
 know
how bad it would be for users other than block_resize, though.

(And I suppose we want a resize job anyway then, and that would work for
those cases?)

I know a couple of wrong behaviors that won=E2=80=99t be fixed in 4.2.

That=E2=80=99s a reason why we need it in 4.2.  It=E2=80=99s no reason why =
we need it
for block_resize.

That would certainly be a possibility, yes.

I like your suggestion of only allowing it with NO_FALLBACK, but I
suppose we=E2=80=99d want the same parameter for that, too, because users o=
ther
than block_resize probably prefer a slow zeroing over an error.

So to me the question then is whether the added complexity is worth it
for an rc3.
