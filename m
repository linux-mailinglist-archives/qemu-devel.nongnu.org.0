I think this rule is overly restrictive. That you can't delete a bitmap
that is in use is obvious. That you can't have more than one "consumer"
of dirty bits that clears bits after processing them seems at least
reasonable. But why shouldn't you be able to have more than one
"producer" of dirty bits?

I think we need to find a more general pattern. Maybe the distinction I
made above between producer (setting dirty bits) and consumer (clearing
dirty bits) is what we need, or maybe we need something else to
distinguish roles. But I don't think the definition should have any
reference to bitmap-populate.
