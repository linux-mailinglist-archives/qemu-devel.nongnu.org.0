Not sure if freeing the parameter passed in via a function called
'close' isn't too surprising... it's not that obvious that the caller
is also relinquishing its reference to the QEMUVFIOState; maybe rename
the function to qemu_vfio_close_and_free() or so?

[Looking at the blockdev code, it uses the pattern of first closing the
bs and then freeing it separately, which is a bit odd as the only call
to bdrv_close (which will eventually end up here for nvme) is
immediately followed by a g_free. Just something I noticed.]
