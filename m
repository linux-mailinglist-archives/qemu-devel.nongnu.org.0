Yeah, I noticed that too -- seems like it got "lost" somehow :-(.  For
the record, I've attached here the original e-mail I sent on 06-OCT-2020
that started the above thread.

Thanks for working on this!

Hi, folks

If this was already discussed on the list, please point me to the
thread.  I took a quick look at my local archives, I didn't find any,
besides patches to tests.

I learn that `x-blockdev-reopen` enables a couple of interesting use
cases:

(#) Allowing one to live-change the backing file to point to a different
    location, with the target having content identical to original.
    This one I was already familiar with.

(#) Yesterday I learnt another use case from Peter Krempa and Eric
    Blake.  Allow me to quote (paraphrasing) Eric's example from IRC.
    E.g.  we have (where 'overlay1' has a bitmap):

        base <- overlay1

    Then create a temporary snapshot (which results a bitmap being
    created in 'overlay2', because 'overlay1' had one):
    
        base <- overlay1 <- overlay2
    
    If you want to do a `block-commit` to merge 'overlay2' back into
    'overlay1', currently upstream QEMU does not merge the bitmap states
    from 'overlay2' back into 'overlay1' properly.  This current
    limitation is because QEMU can't merge the bitmaps unless it can
    reopen 'overlay1' [for read-write] _prior_ to doing the commit â€” but
    the only way to do that is with `x-blockdev-reopen`.

            - - -

From an old chat with Berto on #qemu, he was looking for some more
robust testing, before lifting it out of experimental mode, as it was a
rather complicated command to implement.

Currently, I see there are some 'qemu-iotests' that exercise
'x-blockdev-reopen': 155, 165, 245, and 248.  What else kind of tests
can give more confidence?

(I personally don't have an urgent need for this, so I'm not trying to
rush anything. :-))
