Nope, sorry, I was expecting the check here and didn't see that you
perform it elsewhere.  Seems good enough for me.

Hmm, was the hidden device at function #0?  The guest won't find any
functions if function #0 isn't present, but I don't know what would
trigger the hotplug.  The angle I'm thinking is that we only have slot
level granularity for hotplug, so any sort of automatic hotplug of a
slot should probably think about bystander devices within the slot.
Thanks,
