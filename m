Note that if writing zeroes is not fast, and it turns out that we copy a=20
lot of data rather than unallocated sections from the image being=20
committed, that this can actually slow things down (doing a bulk=20
pre-zero doubles up data I/O unless it is fast, which is why we added=20
BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK to avoid slow pre-zeroing).  However, the=20
complication of zeroing only the unallocated clusters rather than a bulk=20
pre-zeroing for something that is an unlikely corner case (how often do=20
you create an overlay shorter than the backing file?) is not worth the=20
extra code maintenance (unlike in the 'qemu-img convert' case where it=20
was worth the optimization). So I'm fine with how you fixed it here.
