Title:
  Extend uefi-test-tools to report SMBIOS location

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  UEFI helper app exposes the pointer to RSDP ACPI table that firmware allo=
cates in guest's RAM
  but it doesn't do so for SMBIOS tables. Hence bios table test would skip =
testing SMBIOS tables
  to workaround shortcoming. This bug is a request to expose two new entry =
point fields (one for SMBIOS 2 and another for SMBIOS 3) so test could chec=
k SMBIOS tables when guest is started a with  UEFI firmware.
