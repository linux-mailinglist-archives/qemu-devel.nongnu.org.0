Another random thought: Should we add a header extension that records=20
the timestamps of an external data file?  That way, if the timestamps of=20
the file have changed from what we recorded in our optional header, then=20
we can flag to the user that our metadata may be stale because of what=20
appears to be external edits.  But that's not always going to save us -=20
timestamps on a block device don't behave the same as timestamps on a=20
POSIX file, and just because timestamps change (such as when copying a=20
file from one place to another) does not imply that contents have=20
changed.  My personal take - unless adding such a header can definitely=20
add safety, it may not be worth the cost of complicating the standard -=20
this was more just documenting an idea I had even if we don't choose to=20
pursue it.
