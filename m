(1) "allow to run" is not correct English, to my understanding. This
form of "allow" requires an object. You could reformulate the subject
line as "allow edk2-build.sh to be invoked from the command line".

(2) "let" doesn't take the preposition "to". I'd suggest:

  Let the edk2 "build" utility [] fetch ...


>>
>> edk2_thread_count=3D$(qemu_edk2_get_thread_count "${MAKEFLAGS:-0}")

(3) The expression

  edk2_thread_count=3D$(qemu_edk2_get_thread_count "${MAKEFLAGS:-0}")

would pass the string "0" as $1 to the qemu_edk2_get_thread_count()
function. That doesn't seem useful (please see the docs on said shell
function).

We could write

  edk2_thread_count=3D$(qemu_edk2_get_thread_count "${MAKEFLAGS:-}")

instead, to pass "". But that would cause qemu_edk2_get_thread_count()
to print "1", which is not what we want here, AIUI.


I think I prefer the approach with "[ -v". While it's nonportable,
"edk2-build.sh" is already -- consciously -- so: it uses an array
variable, for example.


(4) Phil, did you regression-test this change with plain "make" (i.e.,
no "-j" option)? The behavior shouldn't change for that case (i.e.
qemu_edk2_get_thread_count() should be invoked, and it should print "1").


With (1) and (2) fixed, and (4) confirmed:
