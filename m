Thanks David!

While bisecting on upstream git with just "-cpu Penryn" we have seen that i=
t always works there.
So it might be an interaction with some Ubuntu build/packaging/configure de=
tail together with these old chips.

While we still can't be sure if the VMX warnings are a red-herring
chances are that only "-cpu Penryn,vmx=3Don" will trigger the issue -
Andreas will test and bisect with that once he is back online - we will
see if that is any different.

I'll also build a Ubuntu'esque 4.2 with the Penryn changes of [1]
reverted just to complete the interim picture of our testing. That is
available for testing at [2]. Further I added a Ubuntu build with rather
crude reverts of almost all VMX related 4.2 changes.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
