Thank you, I have tested only Mellanox and XL710 so far but am working
on testing with more nics at the moment. I think there's a few more
things to work out with the patches (especially the unplug before
migration) which should give me a bit more time to test other cards.

Also I haven't yet tested unplug with surprise removal. My understanding
is that device_del was switched from using surprise removal to
attention button etc. a while back. So I'll have to find out first how
to try removing a card with surprise removal in qemu. 

regards,
Jens
