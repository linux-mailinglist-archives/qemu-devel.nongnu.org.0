I'll report a bug in KDE and let's see if the guys agree. Maybe it is a
deficiency of the .desktop specification.

Title:
  /usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop should have an "Exec=3D" key.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  According to the www.freedesktop.org .desktop-file specification, all
  "Application" desktop files should have an "Exec=3D" key. The one in
  qemu doesn't.

  This can be easily verified by running kbuildsycoca4 if KDE4 is
  present, but the issue is not DE-dependent.

  Which binary exactly should be assigned as the default one, I don't
  know.
