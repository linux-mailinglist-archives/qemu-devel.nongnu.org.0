Thanks, applied; some comments below.

It surprises me that these paired locks are so common.

I can't think of a better answer than the container_of but it does make
me a bit nervous; I guess we need it because 'ch' comes from the generic
fs code so can't be FVRequest*

Now we're using thread pools etc, maybe it's time to switch to glib's
g_new/g_malloc etc that never return NULL?

Are the debug/logging calls thread safe?

Would seem a good idea because prctl can do lots of crazy things.
