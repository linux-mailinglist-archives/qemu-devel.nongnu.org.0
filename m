If we want to keep the HSS, meaning that DDR memory is already
initialized, then there is no need to create an additional step of
U-Boot SPL phase, because there is no size limitation any more.

Right now, the boot workflow on PolarFire is:

HSS + OpenSBI (as a library) (M-mode) => U-Boot S-mode

It's just not the canonical way because of the HSS and OpenSBI as a library.

A canonical way should be:

U-Boot SPL (M-mode) => OpenSBI dynamic (M-mode) => U-Boot S-mode

So we should be aiming to replace HSS with U-Boot SPL.
