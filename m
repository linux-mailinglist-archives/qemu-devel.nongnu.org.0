An error message the user can do nothing about other than report as a
bug is never nice.

We can try to phrase the message in a way that makes "this is a bug,
please report" clear, but doing that case-by-case can only result in
inconsistency and confusion.  Having a common way to do it gets us to:

Moreover, we want programming errors reported even when we recover, so
they get fixed.  If we treat them like any other error, that is not
assured: errors may be handled silently.

From error.h:

 * Please don't error_setg(&error_fatal, ...), use error_report() and
 * exit(), because that's more obvious.
 * Likewise, don't error_setg(&error_abort, ...), use assert().
