Title:
  Please provide an option to print the default hardware configuration
  as command-line options, to make -nodefaults easier to use

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  For full customization of the default set of hardware qemu supports, a
  user can pass -nodefaults and then manually specify each device they
  want.  Many specific options document what they translate to in terms
  of the full configuration model; however, the defaults for any given
  platform don't.

  I'd love to have documentation of the default hardware configuration,
  in terms of qemu command-line options, to make it easy to run qemu
  -nodefaults, paste in the default command-line, and edit it.

  As this varies by emulated machine, perhaps qemu could have a command-
  line option to print a specific machine (e.g. pc-i440fx-2.5) in the
  form of qemu command-line options?
