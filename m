The only reason a separate command might make sense is if libvirt would
want to provide a specific error to the user/upper management layer that
the operation failed due to a transient failure (so that it can be
retried later).

We don't really want to go to a policy decision of how long to wait in
such case, so unless qemu waits libvirt will plainly want to report an
error.

That said IMO 'device_add' should still fail if it's certain that the
device won't be plugged in. This will fix any client which is currently
in use. Adding a separate command is worth only for pre-checking for
saner error handling.

While it was me who implemented device_add for cpu/memory I don't
remmeber any more whether we are really prepared for it.

We certainly want to do it if there's a possibility to do it.
