I can't find where atomics.rst says seq-cst operations are almost never
what you want?

I'm surprised that this isn't documented more prominently. Seq-cst
operations are the first type of atomic operation documented. It would
help to move them to the end of the document if they shouldn't be used.

They don't provide atomic arithmetic/logic operations. The only
non-seq-cst ALU operation I see in atomic.h is
atomic_fetch_inc_nonzero(), and it's a cmpxchg() loop (ugly compared to
an atomic ALU instruction).

 :(

Good point. But it's easy to error out on 'atomic_fetch_add()' and
insist on 'atomic_fetch_add_explicit()' (where the user specifies the
memory order) in checkpatch.pl.

atomic_load_explicit()/atomic_store_explicit() can be used instead of
bare variable accesses. Although here I don't know how to enforce that
except via typedef struct { atomic_int i; } AtomicInt.

Thanks for suggesting the namespace cleanup I'll give that a try.

Ah, I see!
