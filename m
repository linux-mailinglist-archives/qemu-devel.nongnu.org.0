Many of the features are also going far beyond just protecting memory, so
even the "memory" part feels wrong.  Maybe something like protected-guest
or secure-guest?

A little imprecision isn't necessarily a bad thing, e.g. memory-encryption
is quite precise, but also wrong once it encompasses anything beyond plain
old encryption.
