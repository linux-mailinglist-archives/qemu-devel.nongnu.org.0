For most bits that's true.  Just not for these ones, because they are
integer values rather than bit flags.

The reason for the complex rules is that you need to know what is a
flag, what is a fixed value that the guest uses, and what is a maximum
supported value.  Simpler userspace than QEMU can just use the defaults
since they don't care about maintaining the guest ABI.

That would be with ioctl(KVM_ENABLE_CAP) for KVM, and with -cpu for QEMU.

I don't know... I'm a bit wary of adding hard-coded values in QEMU,
userspace simply should not care.  But I can add comments to KVM to
remind people of values that should not be changed.
