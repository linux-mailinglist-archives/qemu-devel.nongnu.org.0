Your mail came through as HTML-only so all the quoting and attribution

NB, I was not questioning devlink vs sysfs directly. If devlink is related
to netlink, I can't say I'm enthusiastic as IMKE sysfs is easier to deal
with. I don't know enough about devlink to have much of an opinion though.
The key point was that I don't want the userspace APIs we need to deal with
to be vendor specific.

What I care about is that we have a *standard* userspace API for performing
device compatibility checking / state migration, for use by QEMU/libvirt/
OpenStack, such that we can write code without countless vendor specific
code paths.

If there is vendor specific stuff on the side, that's fine as we can ignore
that, but the core functionality for device compat / migration needs to be
standardized.

Daniel
