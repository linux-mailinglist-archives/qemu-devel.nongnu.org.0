I can see the use for range(x), but not for range(a, b).

(At least it=E2=80=99s not Rust, where [a..b] is [a, b), too =E2=80=93 it=
=E2=80=99s enclosed in
square brackets, it should be closed, damnit.)

I=E2=80=99m not blaming the basic idea, I=E2=80=99m blaming the syntax.  =
In fact, I=E2=80=99m
blaming exactly that it isn=E2=80=99t literally functional because there =
are no
functions here (but .get() and []).  I would like to have functions
because function names would tell me what=E2=80=99s going on.

I can never remember what {:} means (why do they use such nice words
everywhere else, like =E2=80=9Cor=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cfor=E2=80=9D, or =E2=
=80=9Cin=E2=80=9D, and then they do that?).
And I find it weird that postfix-for can introduce variables after they
are used.  That may be the way I would read it aloud, but that=E2=80=99s
definitely not the way I *think*.

Ah.  Thanks.  I thought it was some filter where it would only return
elements where 'device' or 'qdev' is set.  So that seemed completely
stupid to me, to have the iteration in the end, but the filter in the
beginning.

Why can=E2=80=99t they write it like normal human beings.  Like

Hash[res['return'].map { |device| [device['device'] || device['qdev'],
                                   device['dirty-bitmaps'] or {}]}]

By the way, this is the reason why you=E2=80=99ll always see me using map=
() and
filter() and then someone saying that there is a more Python-y way of
doing themes, namely postfix-for.  I hate postfix-for.  I also hate
postfix-if-else, by the way, but I felt like I didn=E2=80=99t want to go =

Well, it is shorter and more optimal!!!  (Saves two conversions to FP,
then an FP division, and then one conversion back to integer!!)

It seems to me more and more like Python is very aggressively tuned to
what I find difficult to read.

(You=E2=80=99re also still free to write =E2=80=9Ccancel =3D failure =3D=3D=
 'simulated'=E2=80=9D.  I
wouldn=E2=80=99t write that in C, but well.)

Sorry for becoming very grumpy here (can=E2=80=99t help myself), but why =
would I
run it when apparently Python has just bad opinions about what=E2=80=99s
readable and what isn=E2=80=99t.
