I get you.

Nope NetclientState is not necessarily a NIC, it can be a peer of the=20
NIC (e.g network backend like tap, hubport etc).

No :)

Thanks for the pointer.

I agree that there's no need to change that part. But we may consider to=20
unify the CanBusClientState and NetClientState in the future.
