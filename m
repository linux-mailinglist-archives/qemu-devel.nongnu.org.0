Some portions of cpus.c seem to belong to qom/cpu.c, other
portions seem to belong to hw/core/machine.c, others to accel/*.
To be honest, I don't really know what kind of code would really
belong to cpus.c (the comment block at the top just says "QEMU
System Emulator").  Cleaning this up would be very welcome.

In other words: yes, if you try to move the QMP query-cpu* code
outside cpus.c to Machine Core, I wouldn't mind at all.
