-- Since [vmx|invtsc]_mig_blocker are both global in scope, isn't it =
possible you end up deleting one or both valid blockers that were =
created by a previous invocation of kvm_arch_init_vcpu() ?  Seems to me =
that you would need something like an additional pair of local boolean =
variables named created_[vmx|invtsc]_mig_blocker and condition the calls =
to migrate_del_blocker() accordingly. On the positive side, that would =
simplify some of the logic around when and if it's ok to jump to "fail" =
(and you wouldn't need the "fail2").

I actually thought about this as-well when I encountered this issue.
In general one can argue that every vCPU should introduce it=E2=80=99s =
own migration blocker on init (if required) and remove it=E2=80=99s own =
migration blocker on deletion (on vCPU destroy).
On 99% of the time, all of this shouldn=E2=80=99t matter as all vCPUs of =
a given VM have exactly the same properties.
Anyway, I decided that this is entirely not relevant for this =
patch-series and therefore if this should be addressed further, let it =
be another unrelated patch-series.
QEMU have too many issues to fix all at once :P. I need to filter.
