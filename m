NULL is the pointer (typically 4 or 8 bytes); NUL is the character 
(exactly one byte in all multi-byte-encodings like UTF-8, or 
sizeof(wchar_t) when using wide characters).

After some testing (including adding some temporary sleep() into the 
code), it looks like 'qemu-nbd -e 2' is currently serialized (we don't 
start responding to a second client until we are done negotiating with 
the first); on that grounds, we are not risking that information leaks 
from one client to another.  But you are correct that it is not obvious, 
and that if we do have a situation where two threads can try to allow an 
NBD connection, then this static buffer could leak information from one 
client to another.  So I'll need to post a v2.

malloc'ing the buffer is not too bad; error messages are not the hot 
path. I'll change it along those lines for v2.

Truncating in nbd_negotiate_send_rep_verr is arbitrary; it does not have 
the context of what makes sense to truncate.  With an artificially short 
length, and a client request for "longname_from_the_client", the 
difference would be between:

export "longnam..." not present
export "longname_from_the_cl...

As a user, I prefer the first form, but truncating in 
nbd_negotiate_send_rep_verr is the second form.

What would error_report() accomplish?  Logging on the server that we are 
truncating a message sent back to the client doesn't help the client. 
This is not a case of protocol violation, and a server sending an error 
message to the client is not out of the ordinary.
