As far as I can see in UEFI v2.8 -- and I had checked the spec before
dumping the table with the many question marks on Shameer --, all the
hot-plug language in the spec refers to USB and PCI hot-plug in the
preboot environment. There is not a single word about hot-plug at OS
runtime (regarding any device or component type), nor about memory
hot-plug (at any time).

Looking to x86 appears valid -- so what does the Linux kernel expect on
that architecture, in the "ACPI" rows of the table?

Shameer: if you (Huawei) are represented on the USWG / ASWG, I suggest
re-raising the question on those lists too; at least the "ACPI" rows of
the table.

Thanks!
Laszlo
