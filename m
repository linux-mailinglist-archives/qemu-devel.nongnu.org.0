Source readability suffers a bit here.

Can we break the line after the colon?

   #          - 0:
   #            if the @vcpus list was empty on input. Guest state has
   #            not been changed. Otherwise,

Or would a definition list be a better fit?

The use of bullets vs. dashes for lists seems a bit random, but that's
not this patch's fault.
