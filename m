I probably worded my suggestion badly - "active" should not be
thought of as expressing an operation type; it should be considered
a direct reflection of the "active" metadat field in a LUKS keyslot
on disk.

So I should have described it as:

 - active: true|false ->  set the keyslot active state to this value
 - active omitted -> don't change the keyslot active state

The three possible states of the "active" field then happen to
provide the way to express the desired operations.

This kind of approach is what I originally believed we
should do, but it is contrary to the design expectations
of the "amend" operation. That is not supposed to be
expressing operations, rather expressing the desired
state of the resulting disk.
