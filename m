The missing functionality (such as alarm timer, if I remember correctly) 
could be added, but I did not bother to fully implement it because the 
clients I was interested in only used the RTC part, so current 
implementation is sufficient for that. Not sure if anything would use the 
missing features but it would be nice to fully implement the chip.

I'm not sure what you plan to use DS3231 for but if clients only use part 
of the functions then maybe implementing those first might be enough but 
if you have time to correctly implement everything then that's probably 
even better.

If you or someone else is still looking for a relatively easy device to 
implement I have this:

https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/wiki/SubprojectMac99I2C

The difficulty in that is that it has no docs but only open source drivers 
to figure out how it works but if someone likes a challenge it may improve 
mac99 emulation.

BALATON Zoltan
