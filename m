Hm. I don't know. I think it depends on what happens in the general case
if we try to migrate, say, right after a breakpoint hits. I'll have to
investigate this.

I thought the implementations would be better suited alongside other
gdb-related code. But I don't mind moving it.

There was a single caller which did:

if (ail) {
    ...
    vector |= ppc_excp_vector_offset(cs, ail);
}

I'll move this to a separate patch.

I could not find any instance, specially not one that takes the current

Well, they are instruction decoding helpers so it seemed closer in
concept to what we do around gdbstub. As I said before, I don't mind
moving it elsewhere.

The SRRs need to be saved because the interrupt alters them. We need to
restore them to hide from the guest the fact that we took the 0xd00.

Now for MSR, you are right, I could just use a flag.

This function is about restoring what we touched with the singlestep
mechanism, so we don't care if the last instruction was a branch. That
is why I can use -4 and a few lines below there's this:

    if (ppc_gdb_get_op(insn) != 31) {
        return;
    }

In other words, a branch instruction would not alter any state that
would conflict with the step.

Now that you asked, I realize I should document that assumption in the
code.

The trace interrupt will set SRR0 and SRR1 *after* the instruction
executes. If we step over a mtspr that touches SRR0 or SRR1, their value
after the step will not be what the guest put there, but what the trace
interrupt did.

So this code emulates the mtspr after the step.

In that case the guest would set SRR1 and do a rfid. So in
kvm_arch_set_singlestep I check whether we are stepping an rfid and copy
the MSR_SE bit over to env->sstep_msr:

    if (rfid) {
        if ((env->spr[SPR_SRR1] >> MSR_SE) & 1) {
            /*
             * The guest is doing a single step itself. Make sure we
             * restore it later.
             */
            env->sstep_msr |= (1ULL << MSR_SE);
        }
        ...
    }

After the step, if env->sstep_msr has MSR_SE set, I let the interrupt
handler execute since it is a legitimate interrupt caused by the guest:

        kvm_remove_breakpoint(cs, trace_handler_addr, 4, GDB_BREAKPOINT_SW);

        if (env->sstep_msr & (1ULL << MSR_SE)) {
            /*
             * The guest expects the last instruction to have caused a
             * single step, go back into the interrupt handler.
             */
            return 1;  <-- 1 means go back to GDB, 0 means back to the guest
        }

At this point QEMU will be single stepping the trace interrupt handler
code (i.e. we're debugging the step that was caused by the guest) and
the code you asked about will not execute. When we return to the
instruction after the one stepped by the guest, the MSR will be whatever
the interrupt handler set it to.

Should I make the trace_handler_addr persistent across the step so I can
verify if it changed? Or maybe just use 2 (3?) breakpoints? I think
Alexey suggested that once...

This is a regular breakpoint that happened while single stepping (the
'return 1' means "return to gdb").

With GDB's scheduler-locking=off, threads other than the one being
debugged are allowed to execute when we run the program. If the vcpu
that is stepping gets preempted, the singlestep_enabled flag in QEMU
will still be set (it gets cleared only after the kvm_handle* code) so
if that vcpu hits a breakpoint we handle it through here. Since it is
not a "single-step breakpoint" we just ignore it and let GDB treat it
like a regular breakpoint (which it is).
