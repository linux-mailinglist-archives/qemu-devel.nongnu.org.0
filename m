The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Switching from the monitor to the emulated machine with a French
  keyboard (AZERTY)

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,
  I run qemu in an xterm terminal, with TERM=3Dvt100. My keyboard is french=
 AZERTY.

  sudo ./qemu-system-hppa -monitor /dev/pts/2 -k fr  -boot d -drive
  if=3Dscsi,bus=3D0,index=3D5,file=3D../../hpux_11iv1.img,format=3Draw -ser=
ial
  mon:stdio -D qemu1.log -nographic -m 512 -d nochain -cdrom
  ../../distri/11iv1/'HP-
  UX_11iv1_B.11.11_TCOE_September_2005_1of4_Core_OS
  _Install&Recovery_B6821-10046.iso' -net nic,model=3Dtulip  -net tap

  When I want to use the monitor (to change cdrom during the hp-ux
  installation process), the characters I type are misinterpreted. For
  example, I enter "2" at hp-ux prompt, I see : "412691;82;22".
  Impossible to switch from monitor to hp-ux with Ctrl+Alt+1 and
  Ctrl+Alt+2.

  I tried with Debian and Fedora host, TERM=3Dxterm and TERM=3Dvt100, qemu =
options -alt-grab and -ctrl-grab, -monitor in the same terminal or an other=
 terminal than hp-ux. Nothing works.
  Best regards.
