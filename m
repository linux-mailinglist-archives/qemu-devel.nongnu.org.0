"call" should be "kick".  "kick" is the driver->device request
submission notification and "call" is the device->driver request
completion notification.

Please include an explanation of how this message is different from
the existing methods.  Maybe something like:

  Unlike eventfd or polling, this message allows the master to control
precisely when virtqueue processing happens.  When the master uses
``need_reply`` to receive a reply, it knows the device has become
aware of the virtqueue activity.
