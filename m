This is not a language we spend a lot of time editing, too. Is it really 
such a big cost to re-learn a tiny language like this?

That concern seems overplayed, in my view.

I agree as violently as I know how. The purpose of this is not for us, 
it's for the ecosystem.

I saw the critique that we still use JSON-ish for the runtime QMP 
protocol, and moving the QAPI IDL to a standard wouldn't remove all 
instances of a custom format from our tree.

This is actually a great argument for doing the other thing: moving QMP 
onto a standard protocol. The point is not to complicate matters for 
QEMU developers, but to simplify matters for developers from other 
projects who are integrating QEMU.

I have a lot of code trying to pylint and mypy-ify the QAPI parser, and 
a prototype YAML parser. The work that remains to be done is hooking up 
my new YAML parser into the code generator.

Assuming I am able to continue working on this, an RFC could be soon.
