Your wish is my command!

Bigger fish to fry, but with other languages like rust looming, making 
the core generation facilities nicer might be ...nice. Not for this series.

Two approaches in general would make sense to me:

1. Building an AST for C instead of strings, and rendering the AST.
2. Writing a templating engine that doesn't break the Python indentation 
flow by hoisting them into module constants and improving the rendering 
logic.
