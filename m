It's the only possible syntax for specifying ChardevBackend.type, so if
you don't allow this, everything breaks down.

The strategy implemented in this version is: Collisions are generally an
error, except for wildcard aliases conflicting with a non-wildcard-alias
value. In this case the wildcard alias is ignored and the value is
assumed to belong elsewhere.

If it doesn't belong elsewhere in the end, it still sits in the QDict
when qobject_input_check_struct() runs, so you get an error.

So does the new -chardev in its compatibility code, but if you want to
specify it explicitly, addr.type is what you should use.

About as bizarre as shadowing variables in C. The more local one wins.

Not reasonably, I would say. Of course, you could try to cover all
paths with aliases in the top level, but the top level really shouldn't
have to know about the details of types deep inside some union variants.

The solution for reducing the allowed options here is to work on
introspection, mark 'data' deprecated everywhere and get rid of the
simple union nonsense.

I think I've come to the conclusion that it's not easy enough to
explain. As long as the parsing order should remain an implementation
detail that schema authors shouldn't rely on, it's not possible at all.

It's a pity because the code would have been simpler and it would
probably have worked for the cases we're interested in. But it doesn't
work in all hypothetical cases and we can't document the conditions for
that without making people rely on the parsing order.
