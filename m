In the above example there is some specific SVE stuff there. If the
command line has sve4=on, then it must also have sve1=on and sve2=on,
per the architecture requiring all smaller power-of-2 vector lengths.
Only sve3 is optional, but because it's optional we have to explicitly
state when it's on or off in order to ensure we can cleanly fail a
migration to a host that doesn't support that option.

These properties are per-vcpu for KVM only. QEMU doesn't have a way
to allow per-vcpu features to be described on the command line yet.
With '-cpu host,...' The '...' applies to all vcpus. So we are "just"
working on the symmetric support now.
