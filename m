So you can't hit it when booting Linux with powersave=3Doff?

Do we model stop with EC=3D0 properly? Looks like helper_pminsn seems to
be doing the right thing there.

That should be okay, the hardware can always enter a shallower state=20
than was asked for. Linux will handle it. For testing purpose, we could
model deeper states by scribbling on registers and indicating state loss.

Aide from SRR1 sleep state value, Linux uses the SRR1 wake reason value=20
to run the interrupt handler, but even if we got SRR1 wrong, Linux=20
eventually enables MSR[EE] so the interrupt should get replayed then=20
(this is what Linux used to do until we added the wake-reason processing=20
for improved performance).

But we do appear to get those right in powerpc_reset_wakeup().

Thanks,
Nick
