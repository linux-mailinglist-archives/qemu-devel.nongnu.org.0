After checking out all patches and some pondering, used here approach
looks to me too intrusive for the task at hand especially where it
comes to generic code.

(Ignore till =3D=3D=3D=3D to see suggestion how to simplify without reading
reasoning behind it first)

Lets look for a way to simplify it a little bit.

So problem we are trying to solve,
 1: calculate APIC IDs based on cpu type (to e more specific: for EPYC base=
d CPUs)
 2: it depends on knowing total number of numa nodes.

Externally workflow looks like following:
  1. user provides -smp x,sockets,cores,...,maxcpus
      that's used by possible_cpu_arch_ids() singleton to build list of
      possible CPUs (which is available to user via command 'hotpluggable-c=
pus')

      Hook could be called very early and possible_cpus data might be
      not complete. It builds a list of possible CPUs which user could
      modify later.

  2.1 user uses "-numa cpu,node-id=3Dx,..." or legacy "-numa node,node_id=
=3Dx,cpus=3D"
      options to assign cpus to nodes, which is one way or another calling
      machine_set_cpu_numa_node(). The later updates 'possible_cpus' list
      with node information. It happens early when total number of nodes
      is not available.

  2.2 user does not provide explicit node mappings for CPUs.
      QEMU steps in and assigns possible cpus to nodes in machine_numa_fini=
sh_cpu_init()
      (using the same machine_set_cpu_numa_node()) right before calling boa=
rds
      specific machine init(). At that time total number of nodes is known.

In 1 -- 2.1 cases, 'arch_id' in 'possible_cpus' list doesn't have to be def=
ined before
boards init() is run.

In 2.2 case it calls get_default_cpu_node_id() -> x86_get_default_cpu_node_=
id()
which uses arch_id calculate numa node.
But then question is: does it have to use APIC id or could it infer 'pkg_id=
',
it's after, from ms->possible_cpus->cpus[i].props data?
 =20
With that out of the way APIC ID will be used only during board's init(),
so board could update possible_cpus with valid APIC IDs at the start of
x86_cpus_init().

=3D=3D=3D=3D
in nutshell it would be much easier to do following:

 1. make x86_get_default_cpu_node_id() APIC ID in-depended or
    if impossible as alternative recompute APIC IDs there if cpu
    type is EPYC based (since number of nodes is already known)
 2. recompute APIC IDs in x86_cpus_init() if cpu type is EPYC based

this way one doesn't need to touch generic numa code, introduce
x86 specific init_apicid_fn() hook into generic code and keep
x86/EPYC nuances contained within x86 code only.
