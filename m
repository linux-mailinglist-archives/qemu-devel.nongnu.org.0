At least, this little D-Bus experiment puts some light on one of the
current QMP weakness: it's hard to bind QMP.

There are good reasons to prefer strongly typed languages. Whenever QMP is
statically bound there, and such changes are made, it is pushing the
versionning issues to others. It's probably one of the reasons why people
are stuck binding QMP manually: doing it automatically would not be
practical, as it would regularly break the interface & build. You have to
version the schema & interface yourself.

So we end up with multiple bindings, manually bound with mistakes etc.

What does this freedom really gives us in exchange? We don't want to commit
to a stable API? It's not rocket science, everybody else does it with
interface version numbers. What makes QEMU/QMP so different?

As for this D-Bus binding, if we don't commit to some better QMP stability
guarantees, we could simply bump the version of the D-Bus interfaces for
each Qemu release (without compatibility with older versions). It's not a
great idea, but it's the best to do then.
