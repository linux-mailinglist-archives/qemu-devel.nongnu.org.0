Fair enough. I should have added virtiofsd to list. Its an attack
vector and is of concern.

Sure. So does giving CAP_SYS_ADMIN to virtiofsd allow daemon to escape
the jail. If it does we need to implement what crossvm folks did,
remapping of trusted xattr. That will also allow us to run inside
user namespace and still be able to support trusted xattr emulation
for guest.
