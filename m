I wrote a websocket client to help reproduce the bug without a browser:
https://github.com/anisse/websocktty

You can install it to your $GOPATH/bin (defaults to ~/go/bin) with "go
get github.com/anisse/websocktty"

I can reproduce the bug with it by simply pasting a long-enough (5 to 20
characters) string.

I could not reproduce the bug with qemu's  "-serial tcp" and netcat, so
this problem might indeed be limited to the websock channel
implementation.

Title:
  Chardev websocket might not support pasting more than a few chars

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When sending more than 4-5 characters on the websocket serial console
  (with pasting for example), the guest might not receive all of them,
  or worse interpret the input as Magic SysRq keys.

  This might be due to the io loop not checking the backend readiness
  before calling the read function.

  Attached patched fixes the problem on my system. I'm not sure it's the
  proper approach, this is just to start discussion.
