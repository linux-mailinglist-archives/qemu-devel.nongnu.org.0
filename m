Prior to this patch, -F does not work with qcow.  And even with this 
patch, we still cannot store the explicit value of -F in the qcow file. 
Anything that does not use -F must continue to work for now (although it 
may now warn, and in fact must warn if we deprecate it), while anything 
explicit is free to fail (since it failed already), but could also be 
made to work (if letting it work is nicer than making it fail, and where 
"work" may still include a warning, although it's pointless to have 
something brand new that works but is deprecated out of the box).  So 
the following is my summary of the two options we can choose between:

Option 1, qcow backed by raw is more common than qcow backed by other, 
so we want:
raw <- qcow, no -F: work without warning (but if backing file is edited, 
a future probe seeing non-raw would break image)
raw <- qcow, with -F: work without warning (but if backing file is 
edited, a future probe seeing non-raw would break image)
other <- qcow, no -F: works but issues a warning (but backing file will 
always probe correctly)
other <- qcow, with -F: fails (we cannot honor the user's explicit 
request, because we would still have to probe)

Option 2, qcow backed by other is more common than qcow backed by raw, 
so we want:
raw <- qcow, no -F: works but issues a warning (using a raw backing file 
without explicit buy-in is risky)
raw <- qcow, with -F: works but issues a warning (explicit buy-in will 
still require subsequent probing, and a backing file could change which 
would break image)
other <- qcow, no -F: works without warning
other <- qcow, with -F: works without warning (later probing will still 
see non-raw)

It looks like you are leaning more towards option 1, while my patch 
leaned more towards option 2.  Anyone else want to chime in with an 
opinion on which is safer vs. easier?

If we go with option 2, are we trying to deprecate ALL use of raw as a 
backing file to qcow, regardless of whether the user was explicit about 
it?  If we go with option 1, then we are instead deprecating any use of 
non-raw as a backing file to qcow.

At the end of the day, we are trying to discourage users from creating 
new qcow files in the first place; qcow2 is much better.  We still have 
to read existing qcow images with backing files, but maybe we want:

Option 3:
completely deprecate qcow images with backing files, as there is no safe 
way to do things favoring either raw (option 1) or non-raw (option 2), 
and therefore accept -F solely for convenience with the rest of the 
series, but always issue a warning regardless of whether -F was present.

Once we decide which behavior we want, I'll make sure the commit message 
matches the behavior.  Remember, for implicit images, we are starting a 
deprecation clock; for explicit images, it previously failed, so 
continuing to fail is still viable.

Indeed, I can make the test more robust.  But more importantly, we need 
consensus on _what_ we want behavior to be, and write the test along 
those lines.
