I don't think we really have any issues with that. :)

We just need a standard for:
a) assignment of buffer IDs that the guest can refer to,
b) making all virtual devices understand the IDs from a) when such are
passed to them by the guest.

I recall that we already agreed on exposing host memory to the guests
using PCI BARs. There should be work-in-progress patches for
virtio-gpu to use that instead of shadow buffers and transfers.

That's one of the reasons we use host-based allocations in VMs running
on Chrome OS. That said, I think everyone here agrees that it's a good
optimization that should be specified and implemented.

P.S. The common mailing list netiquette recommends bottom posting and
plain text emails.

Best regards,
