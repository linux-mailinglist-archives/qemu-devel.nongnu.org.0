Ho hum, I must have been asleep last night.
Peter only merged 7 of 9 patches.  The final 2 were re-posted:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20200308012946.16303-1-richard.henderson@linaro.or=
g/

which includes the critical change that affects FAR_ELx.

Title:
  ARM: tag bits cleared in FAR_EL1

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  The ARM Architecture Reference Manual provides the following for
  FAR_EL1:

  "For a Data Abort or Watchpoint exception, if address tagging is
  enabled for the address accessed by the data access that caused the
  exception, then this field includes the tag."

  However, I have found that the tag bits in FAR_EL1 are always clear,
  even if the tag bits were set in the original access.

  I can reproduce the problem on both 4.1.1 and master
  (6e8a73e911f066527e775e04b98f31ebd19db600).
