We should also recommend that the daemon itself be run as separate
UID from QEMU, otherwise a compromised QEMU can trivially compromise
the dbus daemon too.

I'd say three scenarios are reasonable to document

 - Everything the same UID.
     - Convenient for developers
     - Improved reliability - crash of one part doens't take
       out entire VM
     - No security benefit over traditional QEMU

 - Two UIDs, one for QEMU, one for dbus & helpers
     - Moderately improved security isolation

 - Many UIDs, one for QEMU one for dbus and one for each helpers
     - Best security isolation
     - Complex to manager distinct UIDs needed for each VM


Documenting SELinux scenarios is probably a bit out of scope for
this.

We probably need to mention about the trust semantics associated
with messages sent over the bus.

ie, just because the daemon has controlled who can send/recv
messages to who, doesn't magically make this secure.

The semantics of the actual methods implemented using dbus
are just as critical. Peers need to carefully validate any
information they received from a peer with a different trust
level.

s/org.qemu*/org.qemu.*/ - we can't claim ownership of every
possible domain name with 'qemu' as a prefix.
