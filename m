v6 has it as TpmCrq. It's local to the file, so from that perspective=20
it's specific to (v)TPM.

In V7 then.

I did this in v6.

Why can we not initialize it once we know the version of TPM? From the=20
perspective of SLOF at least this seems to be building the device tree=20
fine since it sees the proper value...
