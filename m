That's my impression as well.

This ability isn't exposed to the user at all.  Our existing
interfaces are -device, device_add and device_del.

We do have something new that sounds suspiciously similar to
"unplugged but not unrealized", though: the new hidden device
API, added by commit f3a850565693 ("qdev/qbus: add hidden device
support").

Jens, Michael, what exactly is the difference between a "hidden"
device and a "unplugged" device?
