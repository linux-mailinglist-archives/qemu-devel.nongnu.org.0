I think we would be contributing to mistakes by providing a tarball
that contains a mixture of sources and binaries, but not all the
sources for all the binaries.

Yes, I think that's better, as it is cleanly separating the
binaries and sources.

Even bikeshedding a bit more I woud have probably suggested
'qemu-roms-prebuilt-x.y.z.tar.xz' for ROM binaries and
'qemu-roms-x.y.z.tar.xz for the ROM sources, since sources
is the normal tarball content.

The downside is that there's the risk of ROMS not matching
the QEMU version, if people updates to latest qemu tarball
but forgot the corresponding ROMs tarball. Most of the time
a mismatch would not matter, but we should think about if
there is a way to make it easier to diagnose such a
mismatch if only for easier bug triage.

Perhaps the ROMs should install into a versioned subdir
of /usr/share/qemu, instead of the root of it, and the
QEMU binary preferentially look at the versioned subdir
Maybe that's overthinking things though, and we would
suffic to have a /usr/share/qemu/ROM-VERSION.txt file

With regards,
Daniel
