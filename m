The sooner, the better, as far as I'm concerned.

In addition to our feature deprecation policity, we have a "Supported
build platforms" policy (commit 45b47130f4b).  The most common holdback
is this one:

    For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim
    to support the most recent major version at all times. Support for
    the previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new
    major version is released. For the purposes of identifying supported
    software versions, the project will look at RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu
    LTS, and SLES distros. Other long-lifetime distros will be assumed
    to ship similar software versions.

RHEL-7 has Python 3 only in EPEL.  RHEL-8 came out last month.  Unless
we interpret our policy to include EPEL, this means supporting Python 2
for some 16 months after upstream Python retires it.  My personal
opinion: nuts.

I didn't bother checking Debian, Ubuntu LTS and SLES.

For hosts other than Linux, we're less ambitious.
