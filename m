Is that really that bad? You have the device with an embedded kobject
anyway, and you can just put things into an attribute group?

[Also, I think that self/compatible split in the example makes things
needlessly complex. Shouldn't semantic versioning and matching already
cover nearly everything? I would expect very few cases that are more
complex than that. Maybe the aggregation stuff, but I don't think we
need that self/compatible split for that, either.]

=46rom what I've seen of devlink, it seems quite nice; but I understand
why sysfs might be easier to deal with (especially as there's likely
already a lot of code using it.)

I understand that some users would like devlink because it is already
widely used for network drivers (and some others), but I don't think
the majority of devices used with vfio are network (although certainly
a lot of them are.)

To summarize:
- choose one of sysfs or devlink
- have a common interface, with a standardized way to add
  vendor-specific attributes
?
