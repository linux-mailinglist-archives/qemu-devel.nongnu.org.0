I see/agree that using strncmp("qcow2") is not general enough for the
upstream.  Would changing it to bdrv_unallocated_blocks_are_zero() suffice?

A general fix reusing some existing code would be great.  When will it
appear in the upstream?  We are hoping to avoid needing to use a private
branch if possible.

Can the eventual/optimal solution allow unallocated clusters to be skipped
entirely in the backup loop and make the detection of allocated zeroes an
option, not forcing the backup thread to loop through a potentially huge
empty virtual disk?

This seems a good way of assuring the status of the target file.
