Title:
  always fail to build qemu statically

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  I want to build qemu statically so as to use qemu on Android platform(Tho=
ugh Limbo emulator is available on github,it's even slower than qemu in Use=
rLAnd(an Android APP that provides proot container for Linux dists)).
  When I finished building qemu normally on my phone(Ubuntu devel in proot =
environment),I started to build qemu statically.I removed the old source co=
de dir and unpack the qemu source code. I had built many libraries like lib=
SDL2 and libiSCSI for qemu,and of course these libraries were able to be de=
tected by qemu configure program.But when I ran the command:

   =E2=9D=AF ./configure --static --prefix=3D/home/admin/qemu/build --targe=
t-list=3Daarch64-softmmu,x86_64-softmmu,i386-softmmu,mips64-softmmu,ppc64-s=
oftmmu --enable-sdl                                                        =
                                 ERROR: User requested feature sdl         =
                                              =

  configure was not able to find it.                                       =
       =

  Install SDL2 devel

  I had to give up the SDL feature.
  I disabled the SDL feature and ran configure again.The configure didn't r=
eport error,but besides SDL ,many other libraries like libUSB,libpng were m=
issing.I ran 'make -j8 &&make install'.All seemed perfect.But when it comes=
 to the final process--linking executables,the ld program went wrong.It sai=
d it could not find the libraries like -lgtk3 -ldrm -lsystemd,etc.
  I was confused.I had already had a test building which successfully finis=
hed.
  Could you give me a possible way to solve the problem?

  Platform information:
  Ubuntu devel 20.04 ARM64 with GCC 9.2.1
  QEMU version:I have tested almost all versions from 2.11 to 4.2.0.
