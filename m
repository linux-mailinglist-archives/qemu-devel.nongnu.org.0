I actually don=E2=80=99t know what you=E2=80=99re referring to, because I=
=E2=80=99m not familiar
with either the inherits_from paths nor with bdrv_reopen.

I took it you meant the loop over the children in
bdrv_reopen_queue_child(), and the fact that it skips the children that
do not inherit from this node.

So I took it that options that do not get passed to children remain at
the parent level and would throw an error at some point, because options
that cannot be handled should throw an error at some point.  (Which does
happen, as far as I can tell.)

That sounds wrong to me.

As I said, doing a reopen across a block job filter sounds like there
can be many things to go wrong.  I don=E2=80=99t know why anyone would do=
 so
(and live to tell the tale).

So from that perspective, if you do a reopen before or after, it would
work.  You don=E2=80=99t do anything while the filter is there because it=
=E2=80=99s a
bad idea anyway.  If it just failed while the job is running and then
started working again afterwards, that would actually sound good to me.


What does sound bad to me is breaking it just because you ran a block
job in the meantime.

Well, it doesn=E2=80=99t really sound bad, but it doesn=E2=80=99t sound i=
deal either.

I don=E2=80=99t quite see how that cannot be guaranteed.  If the child go=
es out
of the subtree, we should clear inherits_from.

The only way the child can go out of the subtree is by virtue of it or
one of its recursive parents until the inherits_from pointee being detach=
ed.

I don=E2=80=99t see how that can happen without going through
bdrv_unref_child(), which will clear all of those inherits_from pointers.=


bdrv_replace_node() comes to mind, but currently it=E2=80=99s actually on=
ly
called by bdrv_append(), by the block jobs to undo bdrv_append(), and by
mirror to take the to_replace node.  The last case may be an issue.

Well, the unfortunate thing is that this patch is in master now because
I preferred fixing access of a dangling pointer over being sure to keep
inherits_from working in all cases.

I know, that=E2=80=99s all the more reason for me to fix it now.  But as =
I said,
I don=E2=80=99t have much experience with bdrv_reopen.
