I didn't make it the default for now, but I do have thought about making it
the default when it consolidates a bit, perhaps on a new machine type.

I also didn't know whether there's other limitations of it.  For example,
will a new socket pair be a problem for any VM environment (either a
limitation from the management app, container, and so on)?  I think it's
the same to multifd in that aspect, but I never explored.

IMHO merging and declaring support are two problems.

To me, it's always fine to merge the code that implemented the fundation of a
feature.  The feature can be worked upon in the future.

Requiring a feature to be "complete" sometimes can cause burden to not only
the author of the series but also reviewers.  It's IMHO not necessary to
bind these two ideas.

It's sometimes also hard to define "complete": take the TLS as example, no
one probably even noticed that it won't work with TLS and I just noticed it
merely these two days..  We obviously can't merge partial patchset, but if
the patchset is well isolated, then it's not a blocker for merging, imho.

Per my understanding, what you worried is when we declare it supported but
later we never know when TLS will be ready for it.  One solution is I can
rename the capability as x-, then after the TLS side ready I drop the x-
prefix.  Then Libvirt or any mgmt software doesn't need to support this
until we drop the x-, so there's no risk of compatibility.

Would that sound okay to you?

I can always step back and work on TLS first before it's merged, but again
I don't think it's required.

I am not very sure we need that multi-threading.  I'm always open to
opinions, though.

I raised it not as "must to do" but some idea in mind.  I'm not sure
whether we'll have it some day.  Note that this is different from multifd,
obviously only 1 multifd thread doesn't sound right at all. Postcopy is
different, because in most cases the new thread can be idle.

That's also why this series didn't start from N threads but 1 thread only,
because AFAICT it solves the major problem, which is the isolation between
page request pages and background pages. One thread is a very good fit in
many scenarios already.

So without obvious reasoning, I'm afraid it could over-engineer things if
we start with N threads, keeping most of them idle.

Even if we need it, we'll need a parameter to specify the number of
threads, that can be a good way to identify the boundary with old/new
QEMUs, so e.g. upper layers like Libvirt can easily detect this difference
if it wants by trying to detect the n_channels parameter.

Thanks,
