Hi Peter,

Sorry for the delay in replying to this...

With all 4 patches applied, I'm able to boot kernels with large BSS
segments (~128M, ~512M, and ~1G), and I get sensible warnings when they
are impossible to boot, e.g.

# 124M of RAM
[mark@gravadlaks:~/repro]% ./vmboot.sh ~/Image.test-128M
qemu-system-aarch64: kernel '/home/mark/Image.test-128M' is too large to fit in RAM (kernel size 155500544, RAM size 130023424)

# 150M of RAM
[mark@gravadlaks:~/repro]% ./vmboot.sh ~/Image.test-128M
qemu-system-aarch64: Not enough space for DTB after kernel/initrd

So feel free to add:

Thanks for putting this together; this is _really_ useful for my testing
setup, and the warnings above are likely to save people a lot of
head-scratching in future. It would be great to see this merged. :)

Thanks,
Mark.
