Oops, yes, of course. Using the top-level node would create an empty
"copy".

Say we have this graph:

raw,offset=65536
    |
    v
  qcow2-----+
    |       |
    v       v
  file     base

Now you can't just mirror the raw node into a target.qcow2 that shares
base as the backing file, because the offsets will be wrong. In order to
use such a copy correctly, you'd have to use a raw node again in the
backing chain:

target.qcow2----+
    |           |
    v           v
  file      raw,offset=65536
                |
                v
              base

So the case where offsets differ between the top and the base node isn't
trivial.

(If this case isn't complicated enough yet, imagine passing file as the
base node instead... It just can't work.)
