There exists a bug with Chelsio NICs that causes the following error:

kvm: -device vfio-

0000:83:00.7: hardware reports invalid configuration, MSIX PBA outside
of specified BAR

This bug was fixed in later versions of Qemu, and is caused by vendor
misconfigurations of their MSIX PBA. I know a catchall fix was
implemented in recent versions of Qemu, as well as patches applied to
hotfix it in earlier versions. I encountered this bug using a Chelsio T4
device, and I believe the patches are for T5 and newer.

Here is an email chain that has a patch for this situation:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/1435777545-32152-1-gi=
t-send-email-glaupre@chelsio.com/

I'd appreciate it if anyone could tell me what the best course of action
to fix it on my system would be. I assume the solution is to either
build Qemu with this patch applied, or update the version of Qemu in my
Proxmox installation, but I do not know which is the better route to go.

The patch you mention is already included in our QEMU builds, but as you
correctly said it's only implemented for T5 devices.

You'd have to go about patching your QEMU yourself if you want this to
work, or message the upstream QEMU maintainers to include a fix (or even
better: provide them with the fix :) ).

In any case, a full 'lspci -nnkvv' output for your device (and any
virtual functions thereof) would help.

I've attached a QEMU patch for you to try, it has "0xNNNN" instead of
the actual device ID of your T4, so change that before applying the
patch. No liability of this working at all, here be dragons and if it
breaks everything you're on your own, but I believe it's simple enough
to work, provided the hardware quirk is the same on T4 as on T5.

You can find our QEMU downstream at https://git.proxmox.com/?p=3Dpve-
qemu.git;a=3Dsummary, if you put it in debian/patches/pve and mention the
file in debian/patches/series you should be able to build a pve-qemu
against it. Check out our developer documentation
(https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Developer_Documentation) as well.

Thank you so much for your reply! I have attached the lspci you
requested. I think the most recent version of qemu actually has a fix
for all devices that give this error, as there were reports of some HBA
cards also causing it. I would like to try applying your patch, however
for several days now my builds of pve-qemu have been getting stopped by
a missing dependency called libproxmox-backup-qemu0-dev. I have seen
other people on the forums mention that it exists in the repository, but
every time I git clone pve-qemu.git and attempt to build I get the same
error. I thought it would be taken care of by mk-build-deps, but even
that gets stopped by the same missing dependency. Apt install isn't able
to find it either. Would you be able to tell me where I can find this
dependency?

Hm, not sure about that, the patch I added is against our 5.1 build from
the repo. That said, 5.1 is newer than what's currently rolled out, so
you can also try just building the repo version without any patches and
see if that fixes it. That would be nice, since 5.1 will be rolled out
soon-ish anyway :)

Hm, it appears your linker isn't finding the library. Try installing the
'libproxmox-backup-qemu0' package as well, that should have been a
dependency of the -dev package though... Make sure
/usr/lib/libproxmox_backup_qemu.so.0 exists. If you use "make deb" it
also might be necessary to run the build as root.

I ran into problems building it with the patch applied. I know how to
correct those errors, but I decided to check if I could build without
the patches and found that the build fails for other reasons, too. I
have attached the new errors. I have attached the new output.

Just so that I understand it correctly, does the value that
PCI_VENDOR_ID_CHELSIO stores equal 1425? Since I have two of the same
Chelsio NIC installed, would that mean that I have to insert both 8100
and 8300 as my device IDs for my two cards in the patch, and have it
evaluate whether they are equal to the value at vdev->device_id for the
if statement the same way you did? Or should I just be bale to do it
with a single device ID?

There's no relevant error in the output you posted? You should have two
files 'pve-qemu-kvm_5.1.0-1_amd64.deb' and 'pve-qemu-kvm-

with 'apt install ./*.deb' or similar. If not, you might need a 'make

Yes.

And also yes, if you need two different device IDs you need to add more
clauses to the 'or', e.g.:

    ((vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x5800 ||
    (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x8100) ||
    (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x8300)) {

Yes, you were right, I thought the warnings being set to evaluate as
errors would stop the build, but I completely missed where it said it
built the .deb packages. I got it built and installed this time, but I
still get the same error when I attempt to boot a vm with the Chelsio
cards. I have started a bug report with the upstream qemu devs.

Title:
  Chelsio T4 has old MSIX PBA offset bug

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in Debian:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  There exists a bug with Chelsio NICs T4 that causes the following
  error:

  kvm: -device vfio-
  pci,host=3D0000:83:00.7,id=3Dhostpci1.7,bus=3Dpci.0,addr=3D0x11.7: vfio

  of specified BAR

  I discovered this bug on a Proxmox system, and I was working with a
  downstream Proxmox developer to try to fix this issue. They provided
  me with the following change to make from line 1484 of hw/vfio/pci.c:

  static void vfio_msix_early_setup(VFIOPCIDevice *vdev, Error **errp)

  However, I found that this did not fix the issue, so the bug appears
  to work differently than the one that was present on the T5 NICs which
  has already been patched. I have attached the output of my lspci
  -nnkvv
