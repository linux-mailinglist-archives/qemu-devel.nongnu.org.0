make_completely_empty() is an optimisated path for bdrv_make_empty()
where completely new metadata is created inside the image file instead
of going through all clusters and discarding them. For an external data
file, however, we actually need to do discard operations on the data
file; just overwriting the qcow2 file doesn't get rid of the data.

The necessary slow path with an explicit discard operation already
exists for other cases. Use it for external data files, too.
