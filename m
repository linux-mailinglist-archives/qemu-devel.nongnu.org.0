I agree that bdrv_skip_filters() makes more sense. If I have a qcow2
image and an explicit throttle filter on top, there is no reason to skip
this image.

bdrv_backing_chain_next() or bdrv_cow_bs() should be the same in a
boolean context, so I'd vote for bdrv_cow_bs() because it has less work
to do to get the same result.

Well, I'm asking the question because not having the answer makes us
jump through hoops in this series to accomodate a behaviour it probably
shouldn't even have. (Because I agree that filters should probably keep
DATA clear, i.e. they are never the layer that defines the content.)

Additional node references (i.e. references that are not edges in the
graph) always make the design more complicated and require us to
consider more things like what happens on graph changes. So it's a
question of maintainability.

Sorry, I admit this wasn't phrased very clearly. But yes, renaming the
variable this way is what I meant.
