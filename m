I agree, but I don't think this belongs to this particular patch series.
See below why.

That ability exists, but given the many differences between the
recorder and other tracing mechanisms, I found it useful to add a specific
"recorder" command.

For example, assuming I built with both recorder and log trace backends,
from the monitor, I can type:

  trace-event kvm_run_exit on

What I get then is something like that:

  2091091@1595518935.441273:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518935.441292:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518935.441301:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518935.441309:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518935.441254:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2

It would not be very useful to activate recorder traces as well when that
happens, which would have the undesired side effect of purging any
corresponding entry from a following recorder dump.

There are, however, new monitor commands, so now I can do:

  recorder trace kvm_run_exit

I now get an output where each trace shows up twice.

  [120139718 137.127269] kvm_run_exit: cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518954.209803:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  [120139734 137.127281] kvm_run_exit: cpu_index 0, reason 2
  2091091@1595518954.209814:kvm_run_exit cpu_index 0, reason 2
  [120139751 137.127293] kvm_run_exit: cpu_index 0, reason 2

 I don't find particularly useful, so I don't think having that as the
normal behaviour would qualify as what you called proper integration.

Having a separate recorder command, OTOH, allows me to also do things
that are not possible with other trace back-ends, and presumably never will
be, like:

    recorder trace kvm_run_exit=3Dcpu,reason

That configures things so that I can now do real-time graphing using
recorder-scope. The only output from qemu will be:

  Creating new /tmp/recorder_share

But I can now run somewhere else:

   recorder_scope cpu reason

and have a real-time view of what is happening in my qemu. Not particularly
interesting with existing instrumentation, which was not designed for
graphing, but that's easily changed.

Another key feature I get from the new monitor command is

  recorder dump

Now the output will be something like (cut for brevity)

  [150261292 461.814537] recorder: Recorder dump

Of course, in general, you will probably want to focus on some particular
trace after an event happened, e.g.

  recorder dump qemu_mutex_unlock

which will get you:

  [150617808 508.134486] qemu_mutex_unlock: released mutex 0x55d842d66898 (=
0x55d840d032c0:119)

So as you can see, the usage pattern is IMO sufficiently different from the
existing tracing mechanism that slightly different commands and usage model=
s
may be warranted.

Does that interface make sense?


As an aside, if you have activated the recorder sharing mechanism by using
some "recorder_name=3Drecorder_field,recorder_field" option, then you can
remote-control some aspects of qemu as well using recorder_scope. For
example, instead of using the monitor, you can use:

  recorder_scope -c qemu_mutex_unlock

Or

  recorder_scope -c dump

Yes, as I have indicated in the cover letter, further integration is a topi=
c
of interest. This is likely to require some relatively "minor" changes like
the one you mentioned, as well as more significant ones.

What I want to avoid is shooting for some "lowest common denominator" by
constraining the recorder library to just tracing. If this was just
functionally equivalent to the log trace backend, the recorder trace backen=
d
would add very little value and not be worth integrating.

Does the existing qmp integration work for you, or do you have suggestions
for reworking it?
