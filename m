Providing options in virtiofsd daemon so that use can tweak these settings
makes sense.

Given we are already allowing accessing multiple device inside guest, we
also probably need a mode to continue to allow that so that not to break
existing setups.

"forbid", "remap" make sense. And I like the option "expose" too.

"remap" will require little thought that how do we do that. We briefly
discussed encoding device number in higher inode bits and Miklos was
not too keen on it. What if filesystem is using all 64bits of inode. We
also need to do encoding in such a way so that inode number is persistent.

Thanks
