I use it all the time.

True.

I want QemuOpts replaced, and I want its replacement to support
configuration files.

The replacement effort needs some license for incompatible change.  The
less license, the harder the job becomes.

The configuration file format is among the things that'll change.

QemuOpts was a reasonable step forward back when you invented it, and it
served us well for some time, but we've outgrown it.  It's basically
two-level: configuration group ("drive", "chardev", "device", ...) and
option parameter (for "chardev": "backend", "path", "host", ...).  We
really need trees now.  I can't see how to grow the current INI-like
configuration file syntax compatibly to trees without making it overly
verbose.

Telling users now not to rely on the configuration file format to remain
compatible makes sense to me.
