I was thinking of a different instance of the same interface, not a
new interface.  But on consideration that probably means dummy objects
so that's also ugly.


Here's another way to look at things though: I can see why a common
interface for cold resets is useful; we use it during system resets
and bus resets and so forth.  But AIUI, in order to do a warm reset
whatever is initiating it is going to need to know what a warm reset
means for this device - in which case it doesn't really need a uniform
interface for it.

So, would we be better off with helper functions to make implementing
a multi-phase reset easy for devices that do have one or more notions
of a warm reset.
