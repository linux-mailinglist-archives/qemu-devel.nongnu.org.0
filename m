I don't think that's a good idea. That would flood the -d guest_errors lo=
g=20
with unwanted messages that are normal not really due to guest errors. Th=
e=20
LOG_EXCP() is not enabled by default, you have to edit source to enable i=
t=20
so you can also then edit the unwanted messages as well (like commenting=20
this one out if you don't like it). If this is removed, invalid opcodes=20
are still logged from translate.c but the exception generated for them is=
=20
not logged. I don't know if that's useful or not but these are debug logs=
=20
so depends on what do you want to debug. I don't mind this being removed=20
but would be also happy leaving it as it is as it's only shown for=20
developers who enable it and might help debugging. Or maybe these could b=
e=20
converted to traces (although I generally find traces to be less=20
convenient to work with than debug logs and not sure about potential=20
performance impact). So my preferences would be in order: 1. leave it=20
alone, 2. remove it, 3. convert to traces.
