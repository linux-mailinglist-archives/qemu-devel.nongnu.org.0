Late question, but:

Since this is just a warning, we still manage to complete the=20
./configure run, including whatever generated files it leaves in-tree.=20
Is there any additional step we need to recommend prior to 'mkdir build'=20
that will clean up the in-tree artifacts, so that the user then=20
attempting the VPATH build won't still have a broken build due to the=20
leftovers from the in-tree attempt?  'make distclean', perhaps?

/me starts testing; I'll reply back once it finishes...
