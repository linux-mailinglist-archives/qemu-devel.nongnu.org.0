I am actually not concerned about KVM. More about some QEMU thread that
accesses bad RAM block state. With resizable allocations that thread
would get a segfault - here it could happen that it simply waits
forever. I guess a segfault would be better to debug than some thread
being stuck waiting for a uffd.

I do agree that this might be very rare (IOW, a BUG in the code :) ).
And we might skip the wakeup for now. But we should set the page
received in the bitmap, even if placement failed due to changed mappings.

Resizes are properly synchronized with KVM suing memory listeners. E.g.,
with resizable allocations, we will only shrink the RAM block *after*
the kvm slots where modified. (resizing kvm slots while VCPUs are in KVM
is a different problem to solve on my side :) )

As far as I understood, growing works as designed.

1. Destination VM started and initialized.
2. Precopy data is loaded
- RAM block sizes will be synchronized to the source.
3. Guest starts running
- Any RAM block resize will differ to the source.

userfaultfd handlers will be registered just before 3. Growing in 3
means that we are bigger than the RAM block on the source. There is
nothing to migrate -> no usefaultfd handler (it would even be bad to
register one).

We have to be careful, because once we resize while the guest is
running, any resizes race with precopy code. Having that said, it should
not be necessary as far as I understand.

Realloc is not needed (as long as we keep allocating for max_length),
but eventually simply setting all bits of pages that are now outside of
used_length as received (which can be done atomically AFAIK, which is nice)=
.

Having that said, I am currently trying to test the postcopy stuff with
virtio-mem and resizable allocations. So stay tuned :)

Thanks a lot for your valuable feedback!
