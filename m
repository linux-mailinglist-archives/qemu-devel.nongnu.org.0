Er, right, I remember, I made them filters in patch 1 of this series. m( =
:-)

But the chain would still be unique, in a sense, because backup-top only
has one filtered child, so you could go down the chain with
bdrv_filtered_rw_child().

This function doesn=E2=80=99t do that because of Quorum, which is actuall=
y a
better example.  All of its children are filtered, so we must consider
all of them.

But backup-top is actually a reason why this function is wrong as it is;
the target is not a filtered child, so it shouldn=E2=80=99t return true t=
here.

Hmmmm.

Actually, bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter() does nearly what we want.
(Which is why it was used here.)  The only problem is that it expects
@candidate to be a non-filter (as the name implies).  But we don=E2=80=99=
t care
about that, actually.

I suppose I can just turn bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter() into
bdrv_is_child_of(); it has only two callers, one is here, the other is
bdrv_is_first_non_filter().  In the latter, we can just check whether
@candidate is a filter and return false if it isn=E2=80=99t.

Which is not any arbitrary BDS, but one that looks exactly like the sourc=
e.

My point is, mirror has been *designed* to replace the source
seamlessly.  It can do more things today, but that was its original point=
=2E

That means that the target must be exactly the same as the source.  And
then we come to this:

So replacing a node that=E2=80=99s connected to the source only through f=
ilters
is fine because that means the replaced node will also have the same
content as the source.


How about I replace the first paragraph with:

At the end of the mirror job, the target exhibits exactly the same
content as the source, so it can replace the source node seamlessly.  It
cannot replace a BDS that differs in content, as that could lead to data
corruption.

The problem is that =E2=80=9Cthe one on top=E2=80=9D wouldn=E2=80=99t sou=
nd very clear to me as
a user.

Maybe include the explanation =C3=A0 la =E2=80=9CThe node to be replaced =
must be
connected to the source through filter nodes only, so its data is the
exact same at all times=E2=80=9D?  Maybe then users can guess what this
=E2=80=9Cconnected=E2=80=9D means exactly.

Er, yes, sure.

OK.
