OK, yeh the numbering is pretty arbitrary so it's not something I
normally think about like that.

OK.

OK, I can certainly see why this might happen with 1GB huge pages; I
need to have a think about a fix.

OK, so migrate-setspeed takes a bandwidth in MBytes/sec and I guess
you're throughput is in MBit/sec - so at the higher end it's about
right, and at the lower end it's way off.

Let me think about a fix for this.

What are you using to measure throughput?
