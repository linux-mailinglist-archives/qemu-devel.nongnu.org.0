I looked it up and found out that restriction was added by this commit:

commit 62be8b044adf47327ebefdefb25f28a40316ebd0
Author: Bharata B Rao <bharata@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

     spapr: Prevent boot CPU core removal
     
     Boot CPU is assumed to be always present in QEMU code. So
     until that assumptions are gone, deny removal request.
     In another words, QEMU won't support boot CPU core hot-unplug.


I don't think it necessarily has to do with pSeries code though. I was unable to
offline the CPU0 of my x86 notebook:


# lscpu | grep -i 'on-line'
On-line CPU(s) list:             0-7
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online
bash: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online: Permission denied
#
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
#
# lscpu | grep -i 'on-line'
On-line CPU(s) list:             0,2-7
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online
bash: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online: Permission denied
#

The pseries kernel does not have this restriction (offlining CPU0).

Maybe we're limiting CPU0 unplug in pseries because it would break common QEMU
code that has this restriction due to x86/ACPI mechanics because, apparently,
x86 can't hotunplug CPU0.


If a good x86 soul reads this and confirm/deny my assumption I appreciate :)



Thanks,


DHB
