It's just a way to do clean up.  I actually used it during development
as the Linux kernel can get very unresponsive when doing error retries ,
so I removed the error to allow things to proceed again.

This is probably the most common case that people are familiar with, a
sector that goes bad and persists.

In rotating magnetic media devices, you can have a media error if a
write was interrupted by a power failure.  The sector has part of the
new write and part of the old write, CRC check fails and ECC is unable
to correct.  This can be corrected by having the host re-write the sector=
.

You can also have an intermittent read error if you have a transient
media problem, eg. a small particulate is moving around on the disk
surface (ransient thermal asperity, instead of persistent).

Depending on disk type (SCSI/SATA) and firmware features, the disk may
auto-reassign the block when it discovers that it had to go through lots
of recovery to retrieve the data or it may require the initiator to
issue a reassign blocks command.  In both cases the lba replacement is
ready to use.

Eventually I think it would be good to model some or all of these other
error scenarios I've outlined above.
