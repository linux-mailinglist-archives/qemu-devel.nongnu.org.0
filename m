Hi,

These are some rather selfish iotests patches.  The first patch helps me
personally because I tend to run the tests over SSH and forget to set
$DISPLAY.  That makes test 139 skip the tests annotated with
skip_if_unsupprted(), because iotests.py can no longer determine the
list of whitelisted formats.

Patch 2 through 4 are specifically for RHEL.  We have not whitelisted
null-aio, so it would be nice if tests didn=E2=80=99t require it.  Sorry,=
 I
don=E2=80=99t have a better reason to give.
In all seriousness, null-co is used widely in many tests, it basically
is our standard null driver.  Tests should prefer it over null-aio, just
for consistency alone.  It is not completely unreasonable to treat
null-aio as optional.  I guess.

Final note: The best thing would probably to skip the null-aio tests in
093/136 if there is no null-aio support.  However, I didn=E2=80=99t get a=
nything
to work: Annotating with @iotests.skip_if_unsupported() didn=E2=80=99t wo=
rk
because the format name is a class instance attribute; and just
iotests.skipTest() didn=E2=80=99t work because that would print 's' chara=
cters
instead of '.' in the output (and emit the number of skipped tests), so
the comparison against the reference output fails...  Which is why I
decided to just run the test with null-co then.  That means that some
tests run twice with null-co (if there is no null-aio support), but
that=E2=80=99s not too bad.  Just ugly.


Max Reitz (4):
  iotests: Add -display none to the qemu options
  iotests: Prefer null-co over null-aio
  iotests: Test driver whitelisting in 093
  iotests: Test driver whitelisting in 136
