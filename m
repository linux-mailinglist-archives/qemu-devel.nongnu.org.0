Is there a way that you can confirm that the QEMU being used to execute
the binaries in the chroot really really is the new one you think it is?
In this kind of setup where there's a chroot and somebody else's CI
system and so on it can be quite easy for eg the new qemu binary not to
get copied into the chroot so it's using the old version still, or
whatever. So being able to rule that kind of possibility out would be
helpful.

Title:
  qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "svn
  checkout"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm not actually sure how far I can help as I so far failed to
  reproduce the issue on my local VM but I get it on Travis CI every
  time. I even went through the hassle of hacking a Debian repository
  into their Ubuntu Bionic VM to get qemu 4.2 as I hoped a new version
  could fix this.

  This build runs in an armv6h chroot. I don't get the segfault if I do
  the same on an armv7h chroot for some reason.

  Here is where the error occured: https://travis-
  ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/309106220#L5420

  Maybe now I'll just try to remove all uses of svn in my build
  scripts...

  Is it actually a viable solution to cross-build with qemu? I'm
  starting to doubt it...

  Would it help if I manage to get this core dump out of Travis somehow
  (maybe make Travis push it to some GIT or upload it to my webserver)?
