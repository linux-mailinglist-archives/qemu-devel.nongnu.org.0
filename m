My general philosophy here is that we'll take anything written down in an 
official RISC-V ISA manual (ie, the ones actually released by the foundation).  
This provides a single source of truth for what an extension name / version 
means, which is important to avoid confusion.  If it's a ratified extension 
then I see no reason not to support it on my end.  For frozen extensions we 
should probably just wait the 45 days until they go up for a ratification vote, 
but I'd be happy to start reviewing patches then (or earlier :)).

If the spec is a draft in the ISA manual then we need to worry about the 
support burden, which I don't have a fixed criteria for -- generally there 
shouldn't be issues here, but early drafts can be in a state where they're 
going to change extensively and are unlikely to be used by anyone.  There's 
also the question of "what is an official release of a draft specification?".  

That's a bit awkward right now: the current ratified ISA manual contains 
version 0.3 of the hypervisor extension, but I just talked to Andrew and the 
plan is to remove the draft extensions from the ratified manuals because these 
drafts are old and the official manuals update slowly.  For now I guess we'll 
need an an-hoc way of determining if a draft extension has been officially 
versioned or not, which is a bit of a headache.

We already have examples of supporting draft extensions, including priv-1.9.1.  
This does cause some pain for us on the QEMU side (CSR bits have different 
semantics between the specs), but there's 1.9.1 hardware out there and the port 
continues to be useful so I'd be in favor of keeping it around for now.  I 
suppose there is an implicit risk that draft extensions will be deprecated, but 
the "x-" prefix, draft status, and long deprecation period should be sufficient 
to inform users of the risk.  I wouldn't be opposed to adding a "this is a 
draft ISA" warning, but I feel like it might be a bit overkill.
