In that case we are exporting new fresh images from destination qemu
using NBD and mapping them into the source and using
blockdev/drive-mirror to copy the data.

At that point (since it's mapped) we could theoretically copy them over.

We certainly do want to copy over bitmaps using blockdev-mirror when
doing a standar virDomainBlockCopy operation in libvirt, so this could
share the code path.

Note that for non-shared storage migration the downtime is bigger
anyways due to us setting up the NBD and having to terminate the jobs
etc.

As I've pointed out in a different response, it feels wrong to me to
enable such a feature by default if it can mis-map the targets for the
bitmap migration unknowingly. Especially since users weren't expecting
that the implications of naming nodes in conjunction with migration.
