OK, so it sounds like the interpretation of the KVM ABI is what I intended.

What is "bitnum" though?  Most of the time, people seem to number bits
starting from 0 -- though of course that's just a convention.

Sure, just wanted to make the point, since this might be an issue in the
future.

The compromise in the kernel implementation was similar: in many places
the code is agnostic to larger vectors, but in a few (such as the ioctl
reg accessors) this seemed too cumbersome to justify for now, so I went
with a simpler implementation with some added sanity-checks.
