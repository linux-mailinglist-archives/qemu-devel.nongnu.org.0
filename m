Agreed, and that's why they have been put into this diffent "gating"
class here.

Organizations and individuals will have responsibility over the
infrastructure they choose to add, which is "inherently different"
from the gitlab shared machines.  Not sure there's a way around it.

I agree... but it's also unrealistic at this point, right?  For
instance, do we have s390x boxes to run all of those?  Avocado has
been using Travis CI for s390x/ppc64/aarch64, and those are quite
unreliable even with a load many orders of magnitude smaller then the
QEMU project.  So, resources are needed to have this flat, 100%
coverage, "ideal scenario" you describe.

I agree.  But if resources are limited, then should the testing scope
be decresead so that it's equalized?

We agree on goals, we don't agree on the strategy though.

This was disscussed previously[1].

With the right automation, such as the playbooks introduced here, any
person with the same hardware should have an environment to replicate
a job and debug and issue.
