Seems like a bug.  Why would we zero more than originally requested?

OK?  I=92m not sure where the benefit is (apart from the perhaps failing
assertions).  So it still looks to me like putting too much energy into
a hack.

(I think the original reason I set both req->bytes and
req->overlap_bytes was actually because I just wanted to be sure, and
didn=92t want to have to look too hard whether either would be sufficient.)

((Please also note that I can=92t guarantee I will review your patch in a
timely manner, for one thing because I can already rarely give that
promise (as you are probably painfully aware...); and now there=92s also
two weeks of mail on top for me to wade through after PTO.  So if
there=92s no reason to change anything apart from saving two LoC, well.
Failing assertions are a different matter altogether, though, of course.))
