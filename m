As discussed here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg00697.html

and here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg01388.html

it would be good to have some more valuable iotests enabled in the
"auto" group to get better iotest coverage during "make check".

Since these Python-based tests require a QEMU that features a 'virtio-blk'
device, we can only run the Python tests if this device is available. With
binaries like qemu-system-tricore, the Python-based tests will be skipped.

v4:
 - The check for 'virtio-blk' is now done in the tests/qemu-iotests/check
   script instead of tests/check-block.sh (to avoid to duplicate the code
   that searches for the right QEMU binary - and we can also still run
   the shell-based tests this way).
 - Added the new patch to check for the availability of virtio devices in
   the iotests 127 and 267.
 - The patch that drops test 130 from the "auto" group has already been
   merged and thus been dropped from this series.

v3:
 - Test 183 fails on Patchew, so I removed it from the "auto" group
   again

v2:
 - Checked the iotests with NetBSD, too (now that Eduardo has
   re-activated Gerd's patches for creating NetBSD VM images)
 - Use 'openbsd' instead of 'openbsd6'
 - Use 'grep -q' instead of 'grep' for grep'ing silently
 - Added the patch to disable 130 from the "auto" group


John Snow (1):
  iotests: remove 'linux' from default supported platforms

Thomas Huth (5):
  iotests: Test 041 only works on certain systems
  iotests: Test 183 does not work on macOS and OpenBSD
  iotests: Check for the availability of the required devices in 267 and
    127
  iotests: Skip Python-based tests if QEMU does not support virtio-blk
  iotests: Enable more tests in the 'auto' group to improve test
    coverage
