At the very least  new QEMU -> old QEMU, but in general new kernel
to old kerenl would be expected too. Assuming a QEMU command line
is using a versioned machine type, and not using host passthrough
features (-cpu host), then it should in general represent a fixed
guest ABI  independant of kernel version/features.

Yep, it is not great from a upstream POV.

In upstream we've traditionally not expressed a specific min
kernel version we expect to be run on. So that lmits what we
can do in upstram machine types.  Downstram distros can
expose stuff pretty much immediately if they desire.

eg if RHEL 8 adds the kernel feature in 8.5, it could in
theory add the feature by default in pc-q35-rhel8.5.0 machine
types (if we ignore pain of containers running on old kernels).
Even if we take into account mismatched usrespace/kernel, the
downstram distros can adopt much more quickly.

There is probably scope for upstream to be more explicit about
min required kernel features, but we'll always be worse upstream
because we target a broader range of platforms/distros.

Yes, the containers world in particular has made life much worse,
because the mis-matched combinations of  userspace and kernel are
much more likely. In fact I'd say out of sync kernel+userspace
is arguably going to become the common case in future.

eg worst case someone running a RHEL-8 userspace on a RHEL-7
container host or vica verca.
