It's not. RISC-V doesn't have write only pages, at least not in the
current priv spec (maybe some extension allows it).

I'm a little confused with this part.

Looking at tcg_gen_atomic_cmpxchg_i64() for example we either:
 1. call tcg_gen_qemu_ld_i64() then tcg_gen_qemu_st_i64()
 2. call table_cmpxchg[] which eventually calls atomic_mmu_lookup()
 3. call tcg_gen_atomic_cmpxchg_i32() which is pretty much the same as
the above two

That means in both cases we end up performing a load or tlb_fill(..,
MMU_DATA_LOAD, ..) operation as well as a store operation.

So we are already performing a write permission check, if that fails
on RISC-V we correctly generate the RISCV_EXCP_STORE_AMO_ACCESS_FAULT
fault. I guess on some architectures there might be a specific atomic
fault, which we will still not correctly trigger though.

The part we are interested in is the load, and ensuring that we
generate a store fault if that fails. At least for RISC-V.

Argh, yeah

Can't we just do the check in the slow path? By the time we get to the
fast path shouldn't we already have permissions?

As in add a new INDEX_op_qemu_ld_write_perm_i32/i64, make edits to
atomic_mmu_lookup() and all of the plumbing for those?
