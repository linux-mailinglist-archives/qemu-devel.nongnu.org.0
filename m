Note that WAET is a table that is not part of ACPI spec officially.
It's specified on it's own document, there is only a single version, and=20
there is only a single table in that document describing that table=20
structure.

Therefore, I cannot write a comment such as build_hmat_lb() have:
/*
 =C2=A0* ACPI 6.3: 5.2.27.4 System Locality Latency and Bandwidth Informa=
tion
 =C2=A0* Structure: Table 5-146
*/

My best attempt to do something similar in v2 is:
/*
 =C2=A0* Windows ACPI Emulated Devices Table
 =C2=A0* (Version 1.0 - April 6, 2009)
 =C2=A0* Spec:=20
http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/E/7/7E7662CF-CBEA-470B-A97E-CE7C=
E0D98DC2/WAET.docx
 =C2=A0*
 =C2=A0* Helpful to speedup Windows guests and ignored by others.
 =C2=A0*/

If it's not sufficient. Please suggest alternative phrasing which I=20
would use in v2.

Thanks for pointing this out.
I will make sure to update my code accordingly in v2.

Hmm... I would have expected as a QEMU user that upgrading QEMU may=20
update my firmware exposed table (Such as ACPI),
but only if I don't specify I wish to run on a specific machine-type. In=20
that case, I would've expect to be exposed with exact same firmware=20
information.
I understood that this was one of the main reasons why ACPI/SMBIOS=20
generation was moved from SeaBIOS to QEMU.

If you think this isn't the case, I can just remove this flag (Makes=20
code simpler). What do you prefer?

Thanks for the review,
