OK thats good to know. Why should fuzzing reports be treated
differently? Is it because they come with a ready-to-use reproducer?

I think fuzzing is quite similar. After an initial wave of reports,
they should slow to a trickle and eventually should just catch problems
in new changes.

While fuzzing can take some time to find issues after new code is
committed, I don't think the problem of reports on stale code is unique
to fuzzing. That should only be an issue for the initial wave of reports
(the same as I'm guessing it was was when Coverity started analyzing
QEMU in 2013).
Additionally, we can filter crashes based on where they occured, which
should give a similar level of control as the Coverity
components/patterns. If problems in e.g. ati or vmxnet are unlikely to
be looked at, we can
 1.) Not fuzz them (easy to do by removing an entry from
 tests/qtest/fuzz/generic_fuzz_configs.h)
 2.) Apply filters to ignore crash reports with ati.c or vmxnet.c in the
 callstack.

That said, IIUC main purpose of the Coverity componsnets/patterns is to
prevent false positives. This shouldn't be nearly as much of a problem
for oss-fuzz reports for which we can provide qtest reproducers.

Fuzzer reports are the same. OSS-fuzz tells us if something is an
overflow, UAF, overlapping-memcpy, double-free, assertion-failure,
null-ptr derefs etc.
If noise from assertion-failure/null-ptr derefs reports is a concern,
maybe we can just ignore those for now?

Thats true - the types of bugs found by fuzzing rather than static
analysis usually are tough to automatically suggest (pretty) fixes for.
I have been thinking about ways to make this situation better, beyond
just enabling the relevant -trace events and hoping they provide context
and make life easier.

I hope this set of people grows for fuzzing reports as well. Though
fuzzing reports are nothing compared to the ~1250 fixed coverity
defects, fuzzing has already helped highlight some serious issues that
have been hiding in the code for a long time. Unfortunately, I think
there is a gap between the types of problems reported by fuzzing and
Coverity, where I don't see someone picking up a dozen random fuzzing
reports and having a dozen patches ready by the end of the day. Multiple
people working on fuzzer-discovered issues have mentioned that they are
often quite time consuming to properly fix (for little preceived
reward). Maybe the solution is to limit the scope of fuzzer reports so
that they might be rarer, but are more likely to feature problems that
people will care about? This might mean having a narrower selection of
fuzzed devices than just "anything that works with KVM"
