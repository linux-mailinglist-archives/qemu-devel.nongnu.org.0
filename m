Reasons:

1. Less work for me, as I would have more conflicts to resolve manually if
   your patch would come next.

2. The dual mutex change is just like 3 lines of code more -> trivial (and my 
   problem)

3. If somebody complains, I just have to revert your patch.

4. For you, it does neither mean more time nor more efforts, as you haven't 
   started to write the patch yet.

5. The actual outcome from your side is the same: you get what you want, the
   lock will be gone entirely after all anyway.

and most notably:

6. I don't see any advantage if your patch would come next.

Christian Schoenebeck
