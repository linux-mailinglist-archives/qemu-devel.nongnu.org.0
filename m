Thanks, You may want to fix the single vt82c686b: in the above commit 
title that was a typo, just for consistency. Will this pull include the 
Bonito BONITO_PCICONF_REG_MASK fix or some replacement for that? That 
would be needed to get the rest of this series starting with 15/24 
working. Up to that it's just clean up which should be OK. I can repost 
the remaining patches rebased once it's merged in master or if you tell me 
which branch should I use.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
