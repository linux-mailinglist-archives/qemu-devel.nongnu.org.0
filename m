If there are additional constrains (due to gpu hardware I guess)
I think it is better to leave the buffer allocation to virtio-gpu.

virtio-gpu can't do that right now, but we have to improve virtio-gpu
memory management for vulkan support anyway.

Basically some way to group buffers.  A wayland proxy for example would
add a "application=3Dwayland-proxy" tag to the buffers it creates in the
guest, and the host side part of the proxy could ask qemu (or another
vmm) to notify about all buffers with that tag.  So in case multiple
applications are using the device in parallel they don't interfere with
each other.

No parameter negotiation.
