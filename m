From: Max Reitz <mreitz@redhat.com>

If the main loop cancels all block jobs while the block layer is not
drained, this cancelling may not happen instantaneously.  We can start a
drained section before vm_shutdown(), which entails another
bdrv_drain_all(); this nested bdrv_drain_all() will thus be a no-op,
basically.

We do not have to end the drained section, because we actually do not
want any requests to happen from this point on.
