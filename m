[PATCH v6 0/3] vTPM/aarch64 ACPI support was posted.

As documented in the cover letter (history log), the presence of the
LAML and LASA fields in the TPM2 table is not clearly documented in the
spec (at least I failed to find it). It is for TPM 1.2. On the other
hand, Stefan said it is mandated for some x86 BIOS to work. Given this
weirdness I think keeping the  Acpi20TPM2 struct is not too bad. See v6 ...

Thanks
