As pointed out above, there has been a question already targeting at
MMIO binding.

Can't you avoid that probing delay by listing devices explicitly in the
device tree? I have no data on that, just heard about. Maybe the same
works with ACPI.

What I heard so far the concerns were more targeting the complexity of
PCI driver stacks in the guests. But that complexity quickly grows also
on the MMIO platform side when getting feature-wise on a similar level
as PCI.

That is needed for managing write access, in fact. We should likely
mention that alignment need (which also depends on the guests' smallest
page size), but the actual value is out of scope for the spec.

If you link guests via a set of IVSHMEM devices, that implies the guests
are aware of who can see what. And it is actually the model to have
multiple IVSHMEM links, split per purpose (protocol) or split per
visibility constraints.

Here the link goes to the PCI spec: nothing special, the usual linked list.

Exactly. PCI unfortunatly does not allow us to describe that with PCI
means, so we need a side-channel. If tried PCI EA once, but it did not
work out:

It's an offset in the config space region. PCI standard.

Exactly. One motivation in Jailhouse context is to allow for a
runtime-verifiable checksum over most of the stage-2 page tables (not
yet implemented but in mind). Permitting the guest to control where its
shared memory shall be would prevent that. I would also mean TLB
management for the second-stage page tables during guest runtime,
something we do not have in Jailhouse and would like to avoid.

>>
>> Read/write register that defines the state of the local device.

>> ### State Table
>>
>> The State Table is a read-only section at the beginning of the shared
>> memory region. It contains a 32-bit state value for each of the
>> peers. Locating the table in shared memory allows fast checking of
>> remote states without register accesses.
>>
>> The table is updated on each state change of a peers. Whenever a user
>> of an IVSHMEM device writes a value to the Local State register, this
>> value is copied into the corresponding entry of the State Table. When
>> a IVSHMEM device is reset or disconnected from the other peers, zero
>> is written into the corresponding table entry. The initial content of
>> the table is all zeros.
>>
>>     +--------------------------------+
>>     | 32-bit state value of peer n-1 |

>> Protocols
>> ---------
>>
>> The IVSHMEM device shall support the peers of a connection in
>> agreeing on the protocol used over the shared memory devices. For
>> that purpose, the interface byte (offset 09h) and the sub-class byte
>> (offset 0Ah) of the Class Code register encodes a 16-bit protocol
>> type for the users. The following type values are defined:

We could link into chapters of PCI spec directly if that helps.

Thanks for the feedback!
