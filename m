Up to here, you're talking about *internal* interfaces.  Correct?

Your motivation is enabling use of Rust in QEMU.  Correct?

QMP is an *external* interface.

It supports compatible evolution: we can make certain kinds of changes
without affecting clients.  These include:

* Adding optional arguments

* Adding results

* Adding values to an enumeration type, branches to a union or
  alternate

* Reordering members of enumerations, structs, unions

* Turning an argument type into an alternate with the old type as branch

We've made use of this extensively.  See also
docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt section "Compatibility considerations."

How do such changes affect clients of the proposed D-Bus interface?
