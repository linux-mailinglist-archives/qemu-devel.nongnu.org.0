Well, not really. The "connected" field is used internally as the flag
in the _connect/_disconnect routines. Because we made oneshot_bh for the
disconnect routine we can't really use it. Also in general the
vhost_log_global_start() routine doesn't know anything about the device
type (in this case vhost-user), so it is not correct to use this
variable here. So what i want to reflect that vhost-user-blk code should
change the state of the device to stopped state and not the general vhost
code should check the connection status. Because of it i've update the general
(struct vhost_dev)->started field with the stopped state. But yes, it is
a good idea to update the comments in include/hw/virtio/vhost-user-blk.h.
Will do it in v2.
