Yes, but until we complete the conversion we can't get
rid of the qemu-doc.html output, because that's where the
HTML output from the QAPI doc generation goes.

To be fair on the automated conversion, the markup in the
source texinfo here is suboptimal :-)

Yeah, seems like a good plan. If the autoconversion works out
then I think the main thing which makes "do all this for 5.0"
at risk currently is that the qapidoc conversion series needs
review and might need overhauling based on that review: it
doesn't take many cycles of review-and-fix to push close to
the softfreeze deadline.

What do you want to do with this patchset?
