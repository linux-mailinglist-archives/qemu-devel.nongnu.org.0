Title:
  USB host device data transfer with control endpoint

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  QEMU emulator version 4.2.0
  Host -> Arch Linux kernel version: 5.4.34-1-lts
  Guest -> Various Linux Distros

  I sent a control message with data through endpoint zero.
  On the other side message is received with all fields correct except data=
 buffer.
  I've tested the data field inside guest with usbmon and data field was co=
rrect but after packet leaved qemu, data filed is lost.
