I've noticed that missing high RAM when cleaning up SPD EEPROMs and addded 
a FIXME comment but did't know MIPS enough to attemt to fix it. Anyway I'm 
also only interested in fuloong2e as a test case for the devices also used 
by Pegasos2 (that I'll need to update and clean up to submit eventually) 
but not beyond that.

I haven't seen these patches before, so I've spotted only now that your 
test case uses -vga std. Shouldn't it work with ati-vga,model=rv100 which 
I think is the default for this machine and that's what the pmon firmware 
expects and has a driver for?
