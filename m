Paolo,

Do you have any opinion on this series?  Or more generally comments on what=
's
your preference to fix the known dirty sync issue with memslot removal woul=
d be
welcomed too.  For my own opinion, I prefer the approach with this series s=
o we
won't need to touch the kernel at all, and it also paves the way for dirty
ring.  In all cases, I do think collecting dirty bit of a removing slot is
slightly awkward already.

Dave has valid conerns about other cases besides reboot where we might stil=
l
want to keep the dirty bits, on either (1) during BIOS/... boots, or (2) gu=
est
unmaps of device mmio regions that were backed up by RAM.  I can continue t=
o
look into theses, however before that I'd appreciate to know whether the
direction is correct and acceptable.

IMHO the worst case of a series like this could be that we got regression o=
n
dirty bit loss, but then we can simply revert the last patch to verify or f=
ix
it (or we can fix the missing case instead).

Thanks,
