> very nice reading, both reports so far. One thing that could be better di=
splayed is the system you used this to generate. This would come handy espe=
cially later when you move from examples to actual reports. I think it'd ma=
ke sense to add a section with a clear definition of the machine as well as=
 the operation system, qemu version and eventually other deps (like compile=
r, flags, ...). For this report something like:

I just want to follow up on this observation here, and not related to
Ahmed's report at all.

We often receive bug reports of the following style: "I have Debian
10.2 system and mips emulation misbehaves". As you may imagine, I
assign the bug to myself, install Debian 10.2 system on my
experimental box, and mips emulation works like charm.
<banging-head-against-the-wall-emoji> Obviously, I need more info on
the submitter's system.

After all these years, we don't have (or at least I don't know about
it) a script that we could give the submitter, that picks up various
aspects of his system. This script, since it is not "for presentation"
could be even far more aggressive in picking ups system information
that what Lukas mentioned above. It could collect the output of
various relevant commands, and yip it in a single file. We should have
"get_system_info.py" in our scripts directory!

Sincerely,
Aleksandar
