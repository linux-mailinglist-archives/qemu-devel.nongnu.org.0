Hi Philippe, and sorry for the delay in answering!

First of all, thanks for taking the time to go through the documents
and posting your thoughts. More comments below.

More eyes would obviously be good, but note that these are really
intended to improve the interactions between QEMU/libvirt and
KubeVirt, so the audience is ultimately developers. Of course you
could say that KubeVirt developers *are* users when it comes to
QEMU/libvirt, and you wouldn't be wrong ;) Still, qemu-devel seems
like the proper venue.

You're right! I was pretty sure I had a line about that somewhere in
there but I guess it got lost during editing. Hopefully the URL at
the very beginning of each document caused people to browse the HTML
version.

I guess the sections in the Index you're referring to assume that you
know that Kubernetes is somehow connected to containers, and that
it's a clustered environment. Anything else I missed?

Perhaps we could move the contents of

  https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/abologna/kubevirt-and-kvm/-/blob/master/Components.md#kubernetes

to a small document that's linked to near the very top. Would that
improve things, in your opinion?

That's probably because they absolutely are O:-)

This sounds sensible :)

Thanks again for your feedback!
