Scanning all L2 entries is O(n), while an autoclear bit properly 
maintained is O(1).

Right now, we don't have any L1 entry flags.  Adding one would require 
adding an incompatible feature flag (if older qemu would choke to see 
unexpected flags in an L1 entry), or at best an autoclear feature flag 
(if the autoclear bit gets cleared because an older qemu opened the 
image and couldn't maintain L1 entry flags correctly, then newer qemu 
knows it cannot trust those L1 entry flags).  But as soon as you are 
talking about adding a feature bit, then why add one that still requires 
O(n) traversal to check (true, the 'n' in an O(n) traversal of L1 tables 
is much smaller than the 'n' in an O(n) traversal of L2 tables), when 
you can instead just add an O(1) autoclear bit that maintains all_zero 
status for the image as a whole?
