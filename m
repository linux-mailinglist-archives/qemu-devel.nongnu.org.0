Emilio was the last person to do extensive bench-marking on TCG and he
used a mild fork of the venerable nbench:

  https://github.com/cota/dbt-bench

as the hot code is fairly small it offers a good way of testing quality
of the output. Larger programs will differ as they can involve more code
generation.

Doesn't running through valgrind inherently serialise execution anyway?
If you are looking for latency caused by locks we have support for the
QEMU sync profiler built into the code. See "help sync-profile" on the HMP.

You can also use perf to use sampling to find hot points in the code.
One of last years GSoC student wrote some patches that included the
ability to dump a jit info file for perf to consume. We never got it
merged in the end but it might be worth having a go at pulling the
relevant bits out from:

The memory region tracking code will end up forcing the slow path for a
lot of memory accesses to video memory via softmmu. You may want to
measure if there is a difference using one of the virtio based graphics
displays.

I assume that is the MMU slow-path being called from the generated code.

This is an optimisation to avoid exiting the run-loop to find the next
block. From memory I think the two main cases you'll see are:

 - computed jumps (i.e. target not known at JIT time)
 - jumps outside of the current page

This is very much driven by how much code generation vs running you see.
In most of my personal benchmarks I never really notice code generation
because I give my machines large amounts of RAM so code tends to stay
resident so not need to be re-translated. When the optimiser shows up
it's usually accompanied by high TB flush and invalidate counts in "info
jit" because we are doing more translation that we usually do.

I'll also mention my foray into tracking down the performance regression
of DOSBox Doom:

  https://diasp.eu/posts/8659062

it presented a very nice demonstration of the increasing complexity (and
run time) of the optimiser which was completely wasted due to
self-modifying code causing us to regenerate code all the time.

Welcome to the QEMU community Ahmed. Feel free to CC me on TCG
performance related patches. I like to see things go faster ;-)
