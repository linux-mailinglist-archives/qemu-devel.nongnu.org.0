I hope people concerned by security build QEMU with the NOP trace backend.

I understand. It would be clearer to have this position documented in
HACKING.

I'm fine with qtests. I was thinking on how sometimes I use ld.so's
LD_DEBUG env var, and thought it might be useful to use it a similar
way, but in a test environment (not restricted to qtests, but also
avocado tests and docker tests).
We can modify each type of test to use the '-trace' command line
argument. While it is a bit more of work, I understand the design
motivations to have a uniform interface.

Thanks,

Phil.
