Maybe.  In general, I prefer my source trees shallow.

We've sucked at keeping new files out of the root that don't belong
there.  Mending our ways going forward is just one half of the fix.  The
other half is cleaning up the mess we made.

The manual should be somewhere below docs/.

Several .[ch] should be in a suitable subdirectory.
