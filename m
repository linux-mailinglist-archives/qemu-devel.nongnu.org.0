Agreed on that front.

I've tried that patch in the past, but it went nowhere at the time.
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-04/msg03173.html

Rebasing it to the present would be a complete rewrite, but I'm still 
willing to do it if we think it will go somewhere this time.

How much of that can be automated with tooling?  Yes, a re-learn is 
needed, but if a tool can convert between the two syntaces with minimal 
pain, the re-learn (in both directions: rebasing patches written 
pre-change for merge after the change lands upstream, and backporting 
patches post-change to trees that are pre-change) is not as painful.

I'm open to the idea, if we want to attempt it, and agree with the 
assessment that it is not a tall order.  In fact, if we were to go with 
the JSON5 language instead of JSON, we are already that much closer to 
having sufficiently expressive (although JSON5 does not seem to be as 
popular in terms of pre-written libraries).

I'm not necessarily a fan of .py for QAPI files; it makes me think of 
executable python code, even if we chose it merely for something that 
python could parse natively instead of rolling our own parser.

JSON5 would also let us get rid of some quotes, if that is considered a 
desirable goal of the representation (although I'm not sure that quote 
avoidance should be driving our decision, so much as automated conversion).
