I'm not sure why everybody is trying to come up with crude workarounds
when all I said is that keeping things in a file is not always
"decidedly superior".

Of course, I would have points to make about that workaround (like that
I often want to use stdin for an interactive monitor, or that I don't
see how this is superior to --machine Q35 --memory 2GiB --accel kvm),
but that's all beside the point.

I think this is a false dichotomy.

You can have everything defined by the schema and properly documented
and still have a non-JSON command line. Translating the QAPI schema to
a command line option is a solved problem, this is exactly how
-blockdev works.

The unsolved part is how to compatibly convert the existing options. If
you're willing to sacrifice compatibility, great. Then we can just
define stuff in the QAPI schema and still keep a command line syntax
that is usable for humans. The code for mapping a QAPI type to the
argument of an option is basically already there.

The only question is "is compatibility important"? If the answer is no,
then we'll be there in no time.
