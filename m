Yes, though I don't think of it as a special case for format strings. So
I would phrase it like this:

- Don't use hanging indent for any nested parentheses unless the outer
  parentheses use hanging indents, too.
- Use a line break before binary operators.
- OPTIONALLY, use a hanging indent for the top level(s) to reduce
  nesting depth.

The first one is the only rule that involves some interpretation of
PEP-8, the rest seems to be its unambiguous recommendation.

Anyway, so I would apply the exact same rules to the following (imagine
even longer expressions, especially the last example doesn't make sense
with the short numbers):

* bad:
    really_long_function_name(-1234567890 + 987654321 * (
        1337 / 42))

* ok:
    really_long_function_name(-1234567890 + 987654321
                              * (1337 / 42))

* ok:
    really_long_function_name(
        -1234567890 + 987654321
        * (1337 / 42))

* ok:
    really_long_function_name(
        -1234567890 + 987654321 * (
            1337 / 42))

Looks good to me.
