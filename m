Yes, this is true. We're now trying to express conflicts with the
permission system instead.

I believe we never had any other pattern because nobody ever could be
bothered to think about specific conflicts. If we had one example of
conflicting uses, we just blocked everything and only unblocked cases
when we needed them (usually not really knowing whether they were really
always safe). So op blocker are almost always overblocking, but
sometimes too permissive, too.

This is why I was asking what we actually protect against here.

I actually started some patches to remove op blockers the other day. The
tricky part is proving that each type is really unnecessary now. I only
did this for RESIZE and DATAPLANE, which seemed relatively easy to
prove, though I guess I could send at least these patches.
