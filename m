ok.

To summarize the changes I am planning:

If SPAPR_CAP_FWNMI_MCE=ON, then enable cap_ppc_fwnmi in KVM. If
cap_ppc_fwnmi can't be enabled then fail early. This can be included in
spapr_machine_init() function.

During migration, if SPAPR_CAP_FWNMI_MCE=ON then enable cap_ppc_fwnmi by
having a .post_load callback which calls kvmppc_fwnmi_enable(). Fail the
migration if we can't enable cap_ppc_fwnmi on the destination host.

I think it should be VM ioctl, let me check.
