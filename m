Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  nested 9p filesystem with security_model=3Dmapped-xattr

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I do not know whether this is a bug or a feature request, but on a 9p
  virtfs with security_model=3Dmapped-xattr, access to extended attributes
  starting with "user.virtfs" coming from the guest seem to be silently
  ignored. Would it not be more correct to use some sort of "escaping",
  say map to "user.virtfs.x" on guest to "user.virtfs.virtfs.x" on host
  or something like that, so that the guest can use arbitrary
  attributes.

  In particular, this would allow nested virtual machines to use nested
  9p virtfs with security_model=3Dmapped-xattr.
