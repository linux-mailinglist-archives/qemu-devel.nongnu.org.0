It seems to

1. Initialize @childobj
2. Set a bunch of properties
3. Add the child property to @parentobj
4. Call .complete() if it's a TYPE_USER_CREATABLE
5. Adjust reference count

Step 3. modifies outside the sub-tree rooted at @childobj.  What am I
missing?

Hmm, maybe this: using object_initialize_child() when initializing
@parentobj is fine; while object_initialize_child() leaves the sub-tree
rooted at @childobj, it still stays within the sub-tree rooted at
@parentobj.

If this is how the function must be used, its contract should spell it
out!

A review of existing uses for misuses may be in order.

By "create link", do you mean bus_add_child() in qdev_set_parent_bus()?

By "remove link", do you mean bus_remove_child() in device_unparent()?

I'm barely following you.  Me reviewing an actual patch could help.

Can we set aside a bit of time to write docs/devel/qom.rst together?  I
know object.h is lovingly commented, but unless you already know how QOM
works, you're drowning in detail there.  You'd have to provide most of
the contents, I'm afraid, because you know so much more about it.  Could
save you time in the long run, though: fewer questions to answer, fewer
mistakes to correct.
