This patchset implements the IE (Invert Endian) bit in SPARCv9 MMU TTE.

It is an attempt of the instructions outlined by Richard Henderson to Mark
Cave-Ayland.

Tested with OpenBSD on sun4u. Solaris 10 is my actual goal, but unfortunat=
ely a
separate keyboard issue remains in the way.

A good explanation by Mark why the IE bit is required.

Thanks all for the feedback. Learnt a lot =3D)

v2:
- Moved size+sign+endianness attributes from TCGMemOp into MemOp.
  In v1 TCGMemOp was re-purposed entirely into MemOp.
- Replaced MemOp MO_{8|16|32|64} with TCGMemOp MO_{UB|UW|UL|UQ} alias.
  This is to avoid warnings on comparing and coercing different enums.
- Renamed get_memop to get_tcgmemop for clarity.
- MEMOP is now SIZE_MEMOP, which is just ctzl(size).
- Split patch 3/4 so one memory_region_dispatch_{read|write} interface
  is converted per patch.
- Do not reuse TLB_RECHECK, use new TLB_FORCE_SLOW instead.
- Split patch 4/4 so adding the MemTxAddrs parameters and converting
  tlb_set_page() to tlb_set_page_with_attrs() is separate from usage.
- CC'd maintainers.

v3:
- Like v1, the entire TCGMemOp enum is now MemOp.
- MemOp target dependant attributes are conditional upon NEED_CPU_H

v4:
- Added Paolo Bonzini as include/exec/memop.h maintainer

v5:
- Improved commit messages to clarify how interface to access
  MemoryRegion will be converted from "unsigned size" to "MemOp op".
- Moved cpu_transaction_failed() MemOp conversion from patch #11 to #9
  to make review easier.

v6:
- Improved commit messages.
- Include as patch #1 an earlier posted TARGET_ALIGNED_ONLY configure patc=
h.
- Typeless macro SIZE_MEMOP is now inline.
- size_memop now includes CONFIG_DEBUG_TCG code.
- size_memop now also encodes endianness via MO_TE.
- Reverted size_memop operand "unsigned long" back to "unsigned".
- Second pass of size_memop to replace no-op place holder with MO_{8|16|32=
|64}.
- Delay memory_region_dispatch_{read,write} operand conversion until no-op
  size_memop is implemented so we have proper typing at all points in betw=
een.
- Fixed bug where not all memory_region_dispatch_{read,write} callers wher=
e
  encoding endianness into the MemOp operand, see patch #20.
- Fixed bug where not all memory_region_dispatch_{read,write} callers were
  collapsing their byte swap into adjust_endianness, see patch #20 and #22=
.
- Split byte swap collapsing patch (v5 #11) into #21 and #22.
- Corrected non-common *-common-obj to *-obj.
- Replaced enum device_endian with MemOp to simplify endianness checks. A
  straight forward sed but touched *alot* of files. See patch #16 and #17.
- Deleted enum device_endian.
- Deleted DEVICE_HOST_ENDIAN definition.
- Generalized the description of introduced MemTxAttrs attribute byte_swap=
.

v7:
- Fixed bug where size_memop was implicitly encoding MO_TE. Endianness,
  {MO_TE|MO_BE|MO_LE}, is now explicitly encoded by MemoryRegion accessors=
.
- While a no-op, size_memop return type remains an unsigned.
- Use '=3D 0' short hand instead of macro logic to declare host endianness=
.
- With new set of constant arguments, sanity checked the compiler is still
  folding away tests in cputlb.c
- Re-declared many native endian devices as little or big endian. This is =
why
  v7 has +16 patches.

v8:
- Split out re-declaration of native endian devices as little or big endia=
n.
  The clean up approach was too naive, and touched too many subsystem.
- Introduced devend_memop converter which the clean up was trying to avoid=
.
- Collapsed bswap in flatview_{read|write}_continue into adjust_endianness=
.
- Fixed pci{stg|lg}_service_call to access MemoryRegion with MO_BE not MO_=
LE.
- Fixed memory_region_{add|del}_eventfd to adjust_endianness with target,
  not host, endianness.
- Used git send-email... apologies to all for the HTML!

v9:
- Rebase on master and test with git am... again apologies to all, thanks =
for
  the patience =3D)
