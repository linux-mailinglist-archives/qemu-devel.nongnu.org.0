A single failure is enough to credibly counter any =E2=80=9Cno more X=E2=80=
=9D claim ;-)

Also, I carefully qualified that as for =E2=80=9Cyour own stuff=E2=80=9D. I=
OW, if you write
your own buffer management, Rust does not help. Well, dealing with
guest memory forces us to have our own buffer management.

The Rust hype today eerily reminds me so strongly of the C++ hype
20 years ago. C++ too was supposed to be a safer C. And indeed,
if you stick to the standard library, you _do_ eliminate a very large set
of bugs which lead to memory corruption, leaks, etc in C. So the
claim C++ made was not wrong. The claim Rust makes is not wrong
either. The false sense of safety that some people get from it is.

How exactly was it an =E2=80=9Cedge case=E2=80=9D? From what I saw, it was =
the most
basic kind of range check, exactly the kind that you see in 99.9% of all
range checks.
