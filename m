There are architecture dependent instructions that do things like flush
d and icaches. As QEMU doesn't expose those semantics to the plugin
(behaviour is very specific to each guest architecture) then the plugin
would have to deal with it itself. You would do this by checking each
translated instruction and inserting a call back in front of those that
do cache operations to make whatever internal changes you need to do
inside of the plugin.

CODING_STYLE.rst in the top level of the source tree is the canonical
document. Also "make check-tcg" will include a plugin test for each
plugin in the tree for each test (assuming you have compilers available
for each guest architecture - see docs/devel/testing.rst).

Good luck!
