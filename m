From the experiments described above, the patch in question changes the beh=

of applications (for example, sound is different with and without the
patch), which is
in contradiction with your claim that you "never encountered any
source code that
cares for this flag" and that "the only part of this patch that will
produce incorrect
values are the flags".

In other words, and playing further with them:

The claim that "referring to this patch as inaccurate is itself
inaccurate" is itself inaccurate.
