That looks like the corresponding fix, indeed. Let's close this ticket.

Title:
  32-to-64-bit call gate unsupported in IA32e mode

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  In particular, the lcall implementation doesn't support the 64-bit
  TSS.

  helper_lcall_protected (target-i386/seg_helper.c:1884) calls
  get_ss_esp_from_tss() on a call gate to a lower privilege level, which
  tries to extract a 32-bit ESP and 16-bit SS from the TSS.  In IA32e
  mode (64-bit or compatibility mode), this instead grabs the lower
  32-bits of the target RSP, and 16 of the upper bits as the SS.
  Additionally, several of the subsequent checks are incorrect (even if
  the correct stack pointer were extracted).

  This isn't a problem for interrupts since the interrupts are given
  their own implementation entirely, that uses get_rsp_from_tss() rather
  than get_ss_esp_from_tss().

  I believe the missing logic is from the branch starting "ELSE (*
  current TSS is 64-bit *)" in the CALL pseudocode in the Intel manual
  (page 3-124 of the PDF I have).

  Reproduced at master (c0b520dfb8890294a9f8879f4759172900585995), and
  also as of a qemu built a year ago.
