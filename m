I agree. Modern Linux kernel and GCC are important too. It seems both o32
and n32, with quirks, are generally accepted, but R5900 MMIs and other
special features are less clear:

For example, given the fact that the 128-bit MMIs are unconditionally
executable on R5900 hardware, a user may be forgiven to believe that they
always work. But unless the Linux kernel restores 128-bit registers in its
operating mode switches, which could be o32, there will be silent data
corruption (and ensuing frustration).

(For this reason I favour full register restores in all operating modes.)
