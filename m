 Do

The runtime behaviour is rather odd, given the docs they provide:

"The performance overhead of the SafeStack instrumentation is
 less than 0.1% on average across a variety of benchmarks=20
 This is mainly because most small functions do not have any
 variables that require the unsafe stack and, hence, do not=20
 need unsafe stack frames to be created. The cost of creating=20
 unsafe stack frames for large functions is amortized by the=20
 cost of executing the function.

  In some cases, SafeStack actually improves the performance"
