Preface to my review of this script: may aim isn't to make it
bullet-proof.  I want to (1) make it good enough (explained in a
jiffie), and (2) automatically identify the spots where it still isn't
obviously safe for manual review.

The latter may involve additional scripting.  That's okay.

The script is good enough when the number of possibly unsafe spots is
low enough for careful manual review.

When I ask for improvements that, in your opinion, go beyond "good
enough", please push back.  I'm sure we can work it out together.

You have --max-width 80 here, but not in the commit message.  Default
seems to be 78.  Any particular reason to change it to 80?

Perhaps ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() should be ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE(errp) to
make the fact we're messing with @errp more obvious.  Too late; I
shouldn't rock the boat that much now.

non-generic

for a purpose

Wrap comment lines around column 70, please.  It's easier to read.

Maybe

   // Skip functions with "assert(_errp && *_errp)" statement, because that
   // signals unusual semantics, and the parameter name may well serve a

error_propagate()

I much appreciate your meticulous explanation of what you skip and why.

This rule is required to make the actual transformations (below) work
even for parameters with names other than @errp.  I believe it's not
used in this series.  In fact, I can't see a use for it in the entire
tree right now.  Okay anyway.

Can't say I fully understand Coccinelle there.  I figure you came to
this knowledge the hard way.

Learned something new.  Example: kvm_set_kvm_shadow_mem().

Spelling it "exists disable optional_qualifier" would avoid giving
readers the idea we're disabling "exists", but Coccinelle doesn't let
us.  Oh well.

I believe this causes

    warning: line 98: errp, previously declared as a metavariable, is used =
as an identifier
    warning: line 104: errp, previously declared as a metavariable, is used=
 as an identifier
    warning: line 106: errp, previously declared as a metavariable, is used=

    warning: line 195: errp, previously declared as a metavariable, is used=

    warning: line 228: errp, previously declared as a metavariable, is used=
 as an identifier

Making @errp symbol instead of identifier should fix this.

Sounds like you tried to merge this into the following hunk, but then

You neglect to match error_propagate_prepend().  Okay, because (1) that
pattern doesn't occur in the tree right now, and (2) if it gets added,
gcc will complain.

Context: rule1 matches functions that have all three of

* an Error **errp parameter

* an Error *local_err =3D NULL variable declaration

* an error_propagate(errp, local_err) or error_propagate_prepend(errp,
  local_err, ...) expression, where @errp is the parameter and
  @local_err is the variable.

If I understand you correctly, you're pointing out two potential issues:

1. This rule can match functions rule1 does not match if there is
another function with the same name that rule1 does match.

2. This rule matches in the entire function matched by rule1, even when
parts of that function use a different @errp or @local_err.

I figure these apply to all rules with identifier rule1.fn, not just
this one.  Correct?

Regarding 1.  There must be a better way to chain rules together, but I
don't know it.  Can we make Coccinelle at least warn us when it converts
multiple functions with the same name?  What about this:

   @initialize:python@
   @@
   fnprev =3D {}

   def pr(fn, p):
       print("### %s:%s: %s()" % (p[0].file, p[0].line, fn))

   @r@
   identifier rule1.fn;
   position p;
   @@
    fn(...)@p
    {
        ...
    }
   @script:python@
       fn << rule1.fn;
       p << r.p;
   @@
   if fn not in fnprev:
       fnprev[fn] =3D p
   else:
       if fnprev[fn]:
           pr(fn, fnprev[fn])
           fnprev[fn] =3D None
       pr(fn, p)

For each function @fn matched by rule1, fncnt[fn] is an upper limit of
the number of functions with the same name we touch.  If it's more than
one, we print.

Reports about a dozen function names for the whole tree in my testing.
Inspecting the changes to them manually is feasible.  None of them are
in files touched by this series.

The line printed for the first match is pretty useless for me: it points
to a Coccinelle temporary file *shrug*.

Regarding 2.  Shadowing @errp or @local_err would be in bad taste, and I
sure hope we don't do that.  Multiple @local_err variables... hmm.
Perhaps we could again concoct some script rules to lead us to spots to
check manually.  See below for my attempt.

What's the worst that could happen if we blindly converted such code?
The answer to that question tells us how hard to work on finding and
checking these guys.

Each of the following patterns applies anywhere in the function.

First pattern: delete @local_err

> +-    Error *local_err =3D NULL;

Common case: occurs just once, not nested.  Anything else is suspicious.

Both can be detected in the resulting patches with a bit of AWK
wizardry:

    $ git-diff -U0 master..review-error-v8 | awk '/^@@ / { ctx =3D $5; for =
(i =3D 6; i <=3D NF; i++) ctx =3D ctx " " $i; if (ctx !=3D octx) { octx =3D=
 ctx; n =3D 0 } } /^- *Error *\* *[A-Za-z0-9_]+ *=3D *NULL;/ { if (index($0=
, "E") > 6) print "nested\n    " ctx; if (n) print "more than one\n    " ct=
x; n++ }'
    nested
        static void xen_block_drive_destroy(XenBlockDrive *drive, Error **e=
rrp)
    nested
        static void xen_block_device_destroy(XenBackendInstance *backend,
    nested
        static void xen_block_device_destroy(XenBackendInstance *backend,
    more than one
        static void xen_block_device_destroy(XenBackendInstance *backend,

Oh.

xen_block_drive_destroy() nests its Error *local_err in a conditional.

xen_block_device_destroy() has multiple Error *local_err.

In both cases, manual review is required to ensure the conversion is
okay.  I believe it is.

Note that the AWK script relies on diff showing the function name in @@
lines, which doesn't always work due to our coding style.

For the whole tree, I get some 30 spots.  Feasible.

As you mention above, these guys don't exist, yet.  Builds anyway,
because this part of the rule is not used in this patch series.  You
don't want to omit it, because then the script becomes unsafe to use.

We could also open-code:

   // Convert error clearing functions
   (
   -    error_free(local_err);
   +    error_free(*errp);
   +    *errp =3D NULL;
   |
   ... and so forth ...
   )

Matter of taste.  Whatever is easier to explain in the comments.  Since
you already wrote one...

We talked about extending this series slightly so these guys are used.
I may still look into that.

The new helpers clear @local_err.  Assignment now redundant, delete.
Okay.

Fifth pattern: use @errp directly
