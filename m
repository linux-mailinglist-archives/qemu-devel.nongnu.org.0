While we still having the discussion about migration and its states, i
think we can split this patchset. The first patchset will be about
fixing the vhost-usr-blk reconnect issues. And the follow up patchset
will be about migration if we decide to fix/workaround this abort() call
at the start of migration. I'll prepare v3 with this bh approach and
will send it for review. What do you think?
