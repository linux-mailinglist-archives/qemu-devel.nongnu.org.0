sigh ...

yes. It now does at the machine init time.

That is more complex because the machine only knows very late about=20
the user created devices, at reset time. We could check this specific
case (two sets of IPMI devices) and warn the user before exiting.=20

May be we can improve the behavior. See below.

A solution might be to tie theses default IPMI devices to=20
defaults_enabled(). Which means that to create a custom set of=20
devices you would need to use -nodefaults now. Would that be OK ? =20

Creating these devices at reset would be much easier but it is=20
considered a bad practice to do so.=20

Any other ideas ?=20

Thanks,
