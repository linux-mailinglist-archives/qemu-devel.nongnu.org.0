Overal I like the patch.  I think that I found a minor error.

Please, consider change the last line to:

       struct put_gtree_data capsule = {
           .f = f,
           .key_vmsd = key_vmsd,
           .val_vmsd = val_vmsd,
           .ret = 0};

It makes much easier make changes on the future.

Once here, I think that you are missing on the middle a:

          .vmdesc = vmdesc,

No?  At least you use it on put_gtree_elem, and I don't see any place
where you assign it.  When I did the change is when I noticed that it
was missing.

As said before, with this changes you have my reviewed-by.

Later, Juan.
