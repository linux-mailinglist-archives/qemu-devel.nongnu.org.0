On a Linux host you're almost certainly not going to see g_malloc
fail for small allocations at least. Instead at some point the host
will be under enough memory pressure that the OOM killer activates
and reaps arbitrary processes based on some criteria it has, freeing
up memory for malloc to succeed (unless OOM killer picked you as the
victim).
