This thread is not really about a CPU model that users could universally
use for both TCG or KVM. It's about checking what CPU model is used by
QEMU if no CPU model is specified on the command line.

BTW, I was told aarch64 is a bit different and QEMU fails to start with
KVM unless -cpu host is explicitly specified. Is that correct?
