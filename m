I read this sentence three times, and still don't get it.  Is the
reference held or is it dropped?

Write me a nice function contract, and I'll update the implementation to
match it.

Even common idioms need to make sense :)

The contract must specify exactly what happens to the reference count,
case by case.

I chose to outlaw a case I see no use for, to keep the contract simpler.
