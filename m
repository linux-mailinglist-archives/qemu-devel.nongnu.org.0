Yes that would be a problem, but isn't it the same in the non-failover case
where a user configures it wrong? The slot where the device is plugged is n=
ot
chosen automatically it's configured by the user, no? I might be mixing som=
ething
up here.  I have no idea yet how to check if a slot is already populated, b=
ut
I'll think about it.=20
