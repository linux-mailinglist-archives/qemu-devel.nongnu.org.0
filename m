It lists all currently known values for this enum. Exactly as you do in 
your comment...
The only way to prevent user from entering a value that is not defined 
in enum is to restrict user to enum-values.
Which can be done if you think it's appropriate. I think it just limits 
production flexibility.

The "guest driver" in this case is open-vm-tools. And it helps that the 
names match.

The "driver" in this case is open-vm-tools.
The legacy guests have proprietary drivers that mimics VMware Tools or a 
subset of it's functionality.

I still don't understand why you view a comment to be better than an enum.
This also contradict the approach taken for other enums in device 
emulation code, as I have provided multiple examples in previous reply.

Which part of license to I ignore?

I fixed all the comments you have mentioned beside this thing that is 
debatable. I wish to hear an additional opinion.
If you really strongly insist on this, I can change this to what you 
want without further discussion...

Why not allow to review all the 15 patches besides a discussion of 
whether constants should be defined in enum or comment?
That seems a little harsh to me.
