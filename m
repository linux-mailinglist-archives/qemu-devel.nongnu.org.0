> -
> -The parameter @option{mem} of @option{-numa node} is used to assign a part of
> -guest RAM to a NUMA node. But when using it, it's impossible to manage specified
> -RAM chunk on the host side (like bind it to a host node, setting bind policy, ...),
> -so guest end-ups with the fake NUMA configuration with suboptiomal performance.
> -However since 2014 there is an alternative way to assign RAM to a NUMA node

> -means to actualy manage node RAM on the host side. Use parameter @option{memdev}
> -with @var{memory-backend-ram} backend as an replacement for parameter @option{mem}
> -to achieve the same fake NUMA effect or a properly configured
> -@var{memory-backend-file} backend to actually benefit from NUMA configuration.

> -
> -@subsection -numa node (without memory specified) (since 4.1)
> -
> -Splitting RAM by default between NUMA nodes has the same issues as @option{mem}

> -@subsection -mem-path fallback to RAM (since 4.1)
> -Currently if guest RAM allocation from file pointed by @option{mem-path}

> -      to the user to load all the images they need.
> - 2. ``-bios default`` - In a future QEMU release this will become the default
> -      behaviour if no -bios option is specified. This option will load the
> -      default OpenSBI firmware automatically. The firmware is included with
> -      the QEMU release and no user interaction is required. All a user needs
> -      to do is specify the kernel they want to boot with the -kernel option

> -
> -@subsection query-events (since 4.0)
