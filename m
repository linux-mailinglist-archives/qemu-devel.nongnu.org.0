Not sure which API you aim exactly, but what one need to remember is that
mapping virtio-video CODEC on top of VAAPI, V4L2 Stateless, NVDEC or other type
of "stateless" CODEC is not trivial and can't be done without userspace. Notably
because we don't want to do bitstream parsing in the kernel on the main CPU as
security would otherwise be very hard to guaranty. The other driver using same
API as virtio-video do bitstream parsing on a dedicated co-processor (through
firmware blobs though).

Having bridges between virtio-video, qemu and some abstraction library like
FFMPEG or GStreamer is certainly the best solution if you want to virtualize any
type of HW accelerated decoder or if you need to virtualized something
proprietary (like NVDEC). Please shout if you need help.
