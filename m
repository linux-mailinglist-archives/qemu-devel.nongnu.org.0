Because of the opcode selection, I would assume that we're not going
to see a VM-execution control for "enable WBNOINVD." To avoid breaking
legacy hypervisors, then, I would expect the "enable WBINVD exiting"
control to apply to WBNOINVD as well, and I would expect the exit
reason to be the same for both instructions. The exit qualification
field is cleared for WBINVD exits, so perhaps we will see a bit in
that field set to one for WBNOINVD. If so, will this new behavior be
indicated by a bit in one of the VMX capability MSRs? That seems to be
a closely guarded secret, for some reason.

That isn't the case with SVM, oddly.

I agree that there would be value if KVM implemented WBNOINVD using
WBNOINVD, but that isn't what this change does. My question was, "What
is the value in enumerating WBNOINVD if KVM is just going to implement
it with WBINVD anyway?"
