I'm not convinced that this makes sense. A matching set of parameter
names + values does not imply that the migration data stream is
actually compatible.

ie implementations may need to change the internal migration data
stream to fix bugs, without adding/removing a config parameter.
The migration version string alone expresses data stream compatibility.

This is similar to how 2 QEMU command lines can have identical set
of configuration parameters, aside from the machine type version,
and thus be migration *incompatible.

Basically the version string should be considered an opaque blob
that expresses compatibility on its own.
