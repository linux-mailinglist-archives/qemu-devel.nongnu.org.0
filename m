Password for firebird 3.0
-------------------------

Firebird has a special user named SYSDBA, which is the user that has access=
 to all databases. SYSDBA can also create new databases and users. Because =
of this, it is
necessary to secure SYSDBA with a password.

The password is stored in /etc/firebird/3.0/SYSDBA.password (readable only =
by root). You may modify it there (don't forget to update the security data=
base too, using the
gsec utility), or you may use dpkg-reconfigure to update both.

If you don't enter a password, a random one will be used (and stored in
SYSDBA.password).

Password for SYSDBA:
