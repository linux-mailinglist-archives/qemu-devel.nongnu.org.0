We might eventually display this in the reproducer output.

What is not clear to me is, can this be reproduced by a real guest, or
only replaying the fuzzer payload (via the qtest chardev)?

Very nicely detailed analysis btw!

Various parts are worth being copied in the fix commit description.

  I can reproduce it in qemu 5.0 using:

  I also attached the commands to this launchpad report, in case the
  formatting is broken:

  Please let me know if I can provide any further info.
