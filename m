We certainly could: add new parameter, default to the old one, error out
when both are given, deprecate the old one.  Way more trouble than it's
worth.

If the QAPI machinery made such renames as simple as

    'overlay-file': {'type': 'str', 'alias': 'snapshot-file'}

we could consider it.  Of course, whether enhancing the machinery that
way would be worthwhile depends on complexity and on use.  I think we
got bigger fish to fry.

Since you already got competent review, I merely glanced at the patches,
and didn't check for completeness.  No objections.
