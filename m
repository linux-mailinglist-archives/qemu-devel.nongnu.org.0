My first concern is that this only partially solves the quoted problem.

Consider the QEMU RBD module which is

   /usr/lib64/qemu/block-rbd.so

This links to

   /usr/lib64/librbd.so.1

On host OS upgrade, just before uninstalling old QEMU we copy RBD
module into:

   /var/run/qemu-$VER/block-rbd.so

....but the host OS upgrade also upgrades RBD itself to a new
major version which ships

   /usr/lib64/librbd.so.2

We've got /var/run/qemu-$VER/block-rbd.so saved, but we didn't
transitively save all the things that this linked to, so there's
no guarantee it will still be possible to load it.

IOW, this approach of saving QEMU block modules to a scratch dir
works, *provided* everything else that this QEMU block module needs
still exists in a compatible form.

Some distros may have a policy that no incompatible soname bumps
are permitted in updates, but that's not universal.

On the other hand this is not a big amount of new code, so is not
a huge maint problem even if only a few people ever use it. I would
be a bit more comfortable if this search path addition was perhaps
enabled by an opt-in configure argument, rather than being always
present.


I'm also uneasy about the idea of using a search path ordering for
doing this.  This means that an old running QEMU is always going
to first try to load the block-rbd.so from the new QEMU, expect
to see that fail, and only then fallback to load the block-rbd.so
that actually matches its build.

IIRC, we have an embedded build-id in the modules that should
guarantee that the first load attempt always fails, but I'm still
uneasy about that at a conceptual level.

Daniel
