Similar situation as for if=3Dpflash.  That one we addressed just for
"tier 1" machine types: i386 pc-*, arm virt-*.

Would addressing if=3Dsd just for these machines suffice?

Addressing if=3Dpflash and if=3Dsd for all machines looks is beyond my
capacity.

For a more detailed analysis, see my "Review of onboard block device
configuration with -drive", Message-ID:
<87fti1i0oi.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>.  Relevant parts:

    The interface types are:
    [...]
    * if=3Dpflash

      Many machines have onboard pflash devices.  They recognize
      bus=3D0,unit=3DU where 0 <=3D U < number of such onboard devices.  AR=
M
      machine sbsa-ref, virt, i386 machines pc*, isapc, xenfv, Risc-V
      machine virt provide machine properties for connecting backends to
      their onboard pflash devices.  For the other machines, -drive is stil=
l
      the only way to connect backends.

      PPC machines pseries* create spapr-nvram devices instead.  It can be
      created with -device instead.

      SPARC machine niagara creates a memory region instead *boggle*.
      -drive is the only way to configure that.

      Other machines create the onboard pflash device only when the
      corresponing drive is present.  Since pflash devices are not
      pluggable, -drive is the only way to create them.
    [...]
    * if=3Dsd

      Many machines have onboard sd-card devices.  They recognize
      bus=3D0,unit=3DU where 0 <=3D U < number of such onboard devices.  -d=
rive is
      the only way to connect backends.
    [...]

    Summary
    [...]
    * if=3Dpflash, if=3Dmtd and if=3Dsd are blocked by the "no way to conne=
ct
      backends to onboard devices" issue, and the "no way to create the
      device" issue.  We solved them for if=3Dpflash with some boards.  Man=
y
      more remain.

Tempting, isn't it?
