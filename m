I thought these changes were simple enough to include in one patch so I 
don't get a series with 25 one line patches when I already have 13 
patches. Also I've split these up after having it working and it was hard 
to separate changes after the fact even if I went through doing it again 
from scratch to create the separate patches.

You don't have to do that, you can just tell me in review how you want 
these split up and then I can change it accordingly. Thanks a lot for 
doing it though, I can't see how this patch could be split up more than 
intno 2-3 patches so doing it was probably faster than explaining it in 
this case.
