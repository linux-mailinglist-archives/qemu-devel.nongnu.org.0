While it may be counterintuitive at first, the introduction of
NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES and NBD_CMD_BLOCK_STATUS has caused a performance
regression in qemu [1], when copying a sparse file. When the
destination file must contain the same contents as the source, but it
is not known in advance whether the destination started life with all
zero content, then there are cases where it is faster to request a
bulk zero of the entire device followed by writing only the portions
of the device that are to contain data, as that results in fewer I/O
transactions overall. In fact, there are even situations where
trimming the entire device prior to writing zeroes may be faster than
bare write zero request [2]. However, if a bulk zero request ever
falls back to the same speed as a normal write, a bulk pre-zeroing
algorithm is actually a pessimization, as it ends up writing portions
of the disk twice.

Hence, it is desirable to have a way for clients to specify that a
particular write zero request is being attempted for a fast wipe, and
get an immediate failure if the zero request would otherwise take the
same time as a write.  Conversely, if the client is not performing a
pre-initialization pass, it is still more efficient in terms of
networking traffic to send NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZERO requests where the
server implements the fallback to the slower write, than it is for the
client to have to perform the fallback to send NBD_CMD_WRITE with a
zeroed buffer.

Add a protocol flag and corresponding transmission advertisement flag
to make it easier for clients to inform the server of their intent. If
the server advertises NBD_FLAG_SEND_FAST_ZERO, then it promises two
things: to perform a fallback to write when the client does not
request NBD_CMD_FLAG_FAST_ZERO (so that the client benefits from the
lower network overhead); and to fail quickly with ENOTSUP, preferably
without modifying the export, if the client requested the flag but the
server cannot write zeroes more efficiently than a normal write (so
that the client is not penalized with the time of writing data areas
of the disk twice).

Note that the semantics are chosen so that servers should advertise
the new flag whether or not they have fast zeroing (that is, this is
NOT the server advertising that it has fast zeroes, but rather
advertising that the client can get fast feedback as needed on whether
zeroing is fast).  It is also intentional that the new advertisement
includes a new errno value, ENOTSUP, with rules that this error should
not be returned for any pre-existing behaviors, must not happen when
the client does not request a fast zero, and must be returned quickly
if the client requested fast zero but anything other than the error
would not be fast; while leaving it possible for clients to
distinguish other errors like EINVAL if alignment constraints are not
met.  Clients should not send the flag unless the server advertised
support, but well-behaved servers should already be reporting EINVAL
to unrecognized flags. If the server does not advertise the new
feature, clients can safely fall back to assuming that writing zeroes
is no faster than normal writes (whether or not the assumption
actually holds).

Note that the Linux fallocate(2) interface may or may not be powerful
enough to easily determine if zeroing will be efficient - in
particular, FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE in isolation does NOT give that
insight; likewise, for block devices, it is known that
ioctl(BLKZEROOUT) does NOT have a way for userspace to probe if it is
efficient or slow.  But with enough demand, the kernel may add another
FALLOC_FL_ flag to use with FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE, and/or appropriate
ioctls with guaranteed ENOTSUP failures if a fast path cannot be
taken.  If a server cannot easily determine if write zeroes will be
efficient, the server should either fail all NBD_CMD_FLAG_FAST_ZERO
with ENOTSUP, or else choose to not advertise NBD_FLAG_SEND_FAST_ZERO.
