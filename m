Not in general, but if we have something like a block-export-add QMP
command, the QOM interface would be redundant. We could still leave it
there and have both a low-level and a high-level interface, but whether
we would want to is something we still have to decide.

qemu_system_killed() is call in the signal handlers for, amongst others,
SIGTERM and SIGINT. This is one way to stop the storage daemon (for
manual use, sending SIGINT with Ctrl-C is probably the easiest way).

What I actually meant is the 'quit' QMP command which will cause
qmp_quit() to be run, which contains the same code. But if sending a
signal is more convenient, that's just as good.
