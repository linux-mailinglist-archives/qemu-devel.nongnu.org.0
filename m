Unfortunately CentOS 8 is not available as a Docker image, which is a=20
convenient way to build EDK2 in a CI.

Thanks for all the pointers, very educative indeed :)

I'll see other setups I can use with GCC5+ available.

I still have to figure if there are free tier CI with less limitations=20
than Travis/Shippable/GitLab, so we can keep the full EDK2 build output log=
.
