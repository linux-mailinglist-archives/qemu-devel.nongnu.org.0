For some aspects of QEMU it might be possible, but considering the
broader set of things which can be deprecated, I don't think it is
possible to expose a machine consumable "suggestion".

Consider the deprecation of the ACL feature. We deprecated monitor
commands "acl_add", "acl_policy", "acl_reset", etc. The suggested
replacement is to use one of the many possible QAuthZ types combined
with the -object arg. Even if we invented some way to express this
in the schema, I don't think any app would usefully consume it.
