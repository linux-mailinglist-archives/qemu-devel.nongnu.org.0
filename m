Then maybe reality is easier to model =)

I guess so. Now I wonder if Peter's approach is doable while still
having "incompletely QOMified devices".

But if we can propagate reset tree via QOM, it is a good excuse
to finish QOM'ifying devices and enforce the API to prohibit non-QOM
ones.

And remove the crutch in device_set_realized().

This might explain the undocumented API called
'device_listener' in qdev which instead uses sysbus:

void device_listener_register(DeviceListener *listener);
void device_listener_unregister(DeviceListener *listener);
