Libvirt can certainly use a property that is settable per-device,
instead of against the pcie-root-port.  In fact the application
that requested hotplug control (KubeVirt) would strongly prefer
if this was doable per-device, because they really dislike the
idea of having to deal with pcie-root-port devices.

So if you added it per-device, libvirt would support both the
per-device option, and the pcie-root-port option.
