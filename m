Hm, is that different from my idea below where one of mirror_top's
children unshares the read permission, and another is allowed to take it
still?

(The problem is always that if some BDS has a parent that unshares this
permission, this condition propagates upwards through its other parents,
and we need to keep track of who unshared it in the first place.)

Yep.
