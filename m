Thanks Kevin. I agree that described guest behavior does not a have a=20
sensible reason behind it. However, just based on purely theoretical=20
basis, according to virtio-blk contract, is it valid for guest to even=20
_assume_ that above situation with 2 requests _must_ be resolved in one=20
of two specific cases i described and not anything in between? In other=20
words that writes will be atomic even if their relative order is=20
undefined. We could not get a clear answer from virtio spec ourselves.

For instance, IIRC, nvme spec declares atomicity guarantees as well as=20
ordering for specific commands ("6.4 Atomic Operations").
