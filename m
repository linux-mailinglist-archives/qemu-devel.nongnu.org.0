Public bug reported:

Currently, I am looking for a method of attaching an sd-card to a
specific bus as opposed to defaulting to the first.

QEMU Version: 5.0.0
Specifically trying to use qemu-system-arm binary


Running an "info qtree" shows the output seen in the attached image. I have=
 attempted multiple different combinations of arguments to attempt to get t=
he sd-card to appear on the FOURTH sd-bus but no luck. The machine type bei=
ng used is Sabrelite. It should be noted that I was able to PATCH QEMU to a=
chieve the result I expected but I had hoped this functionality was already=
 available and did not require modification to QEMU itself.


For reference, this is the patch that was made to source to allow the card =
to attach to a specific bus. After the change was made, an sd-card could be=
 attached to a bus with the following flags:

-drive file=3Dsdcard.img,format=3Draw,id=3Dmycard -device sd-
card,drive=3Dmycard,bus=3Dsd-bus.0


diff qemu-5.1.0.orig/hw/sd/sdhci.c qemu-5.1.0/hw/sd/sdhci.c
1311a1312,1314
>     static int index=3D0;
>     char name[64];
>     sprintf(name, "sd-bus.%d", index++);
1313c1316
<                         TYPE_SDHCI_BUS, DEVICE(s), "sd-bus");
---
>                         TYPE_SDHCI_BUS, DEVICE(s), name);


If there is a way to attach an sd-card to the specific bus that does NOT
require this change, I'd appreciate it.
