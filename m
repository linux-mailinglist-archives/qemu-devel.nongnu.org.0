Yes, the pool is limited to a fixed number of 64 threads, but...

... since the locking would only been exercised with an hypothetical
client doing stupid things, this is beginning to look like bike-shedding
to me. :)

Another option would be to g_malloc() the dirent in v9fs_co_readdir() and
g_free() in the callers. This would cause less churn since we could keep
the same function signature.

Well, I guess Cc: qemu-stable doesn't cost much and then I let other
people decide. I have enough in my plate with upstream.
