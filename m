My main concern about this series is that there is an implicit assumption
that QEMU is *not* configured with certain features that are not handled
If QEMU is using one of the unsupported features, I don't see anything in
the series which attempts to prevent the actions.

IOW, users can have an arbitrary QEMU config, attempt to use these new features,
the commands may well succeed, but the user is silently left with a broken QEMU.
Such silent failure modes are really undesirable as they'll lead to a never
ending stream of hard to diagnose bug reports for QEMU maintainers.

TLS is one example of this, the live upgrade  will "succeed", but the TLS
connections will be totally non-functional.

Regards,
Daniel
