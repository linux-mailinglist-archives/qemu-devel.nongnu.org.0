Adding an event is fairly easy, if everything you want libvirt to do is 
report the event to upper layers. I volunteer to do it. Question is, how 
qemu is going to report this, whether some attributes to GUEST_PANICKED 
event or some new event. But more important is to merge the change into 
kernel.
