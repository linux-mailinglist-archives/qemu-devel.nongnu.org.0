The guest sees the physical_block_size and can try to keep its requests
aligned as an optimisation. But it doesn't actually make a semantic
difference as to how the content of the disk is accessed.

This is what you want for emulating a 4k native disk.

I seem to remember that 4k native disks require GPT, but if you say you
read otherwise, I'm not 100% sure about this any more.

A single option (to control logical_block_size) makes sense for
libguestfs. physical_block_size is only relevant for the appliance and
not for the resulting image, so it can be treated as an implementation
detail.
