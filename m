Sounds good.

Yes.  I did not explain on lkml as you do here (thanks), but I reached the 
same conclusion.

Agreed.  After a quick glance at the code, holding iommu->lock during 
remap might be sufficient, but it needs more study.

No.  We want to support any guest, and the guest is not aware that qemu
live update is occurring.

Same answer - we don't require that the guest has vfio migration support.
