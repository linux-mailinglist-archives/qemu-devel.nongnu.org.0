Yea, that was just a quick sketch to outline the idea without checking
all details.

Well.  With cirrus this proved to be fragile.  The checks missed corner
cases and we've got a series of CVEs in the blitter code.  Switching to
offsets + masking every vram access (see commit ffaf85777828) stopped
that.

Exactly ...

Yes, performance-wise pixman is clearly the better choice.  At the end
of the day it is a security vs performance trade off.

Hmm, checking rtl like that doesn't look correct to me then.  When using
the blitter to move a window you have to set/clear rtl depending on
whenever you move the window up or down on the screen, and src+dst
regions can overlap in both cases ...

Ok.

Ok (I didn't check the pixman code).

Given the use case (run a computer museum ;) I think we can live with
the flaws of the pixman approach.  Security shouldn't be that much of an
issue here.  The behavior and blitter use pattern of the guests is known
too and unlikely to change.

take care,
  Gerd
