I've updated my queues, mostly small changes, mostly to the kernel bits.=20
Besides the already announced places, you can also find them as PR=20
targets on

https://github.com/siemens/qemu/commits/wip/ivshmem2
https://github.com/siemens/linux/commits/queues/ivshmem2

To give the whole thing broader coverage, I will now also move forward=20
and integrate the current state into Jailhouse - at the risk of having=20
to rework the interface there once again. But there are a number of=20
users already requiring the extended features (or even using them), plus=20
this gives a nice test coverage of key components and properties.
