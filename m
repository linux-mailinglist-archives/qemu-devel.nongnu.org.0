vhost-user-net works in the same way.  The ctrl queue is handled by QEMU
and the rx/tx queues by the vhost device.  This is in fact how vhost was
initially designed: the vhost device is not a full virtio device, only
the dataplane.

Send all READ/WRITE requests to QEMU instead of virtiofsd.

Only handle metadata requests in virtiofsd (OPEN, RELEASE, READDIR,
MKDIR, etc).

There are two cases:
1. mmapping multiple inode.  This should benefit from parallelism,
   although mmap is still expensive because it involves TLB shootdown
   for all other threads running this process.
2. mmapping the same inode.  Here the host kernel is likely to serialize
   mmaps even more, making it hard to gain performance.

It's probably worth writing a tiny benchmark first to evaluate the
potential gains.
