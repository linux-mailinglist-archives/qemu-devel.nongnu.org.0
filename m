Pretty much, yes.  Plus, in future if we discover other things that
don't make sense in the context of a guest whose memory we can't
freely access, it can check for those and set sane defaults
accordingly.

That's true for now, but I believe there are plans to make secure
guests migratable, so that's not an inherent property.

Right, because your platform code is aware of the switchover.  On
POWER, we aren't.
