My point is, the interesting part is what the program does before
SIGKILL happens. There is value in reporting memory errors as long as we
can, even if the final check doesn't happen because of SIGKILL.

Well, valgrind can't do anything with SIGKILL, obviously, because it's
killed immediately. But maybe the kernel does get confused for some
reason. I get the main threads as a zombie, but a second is still
running. Sending SIGKILL to the second thread, too, makes the test case
complete successfully.

So I guess the main question is why the second thread isn't
automatically killed when the main thread receives SIGKILL.
