Looking further at the implementation, if we don't encode the LVL in the
key (but just encode the block addr), on invalidation, we are not able
to remove the associated entry in one shot, using g_hash_table_remove().
We are obliged to use g_hash_table_foreach_remove and sort out the
entries according to the invalidation parameters.

Putting the TG and LVL in the key allows to do this in one short if
num_pages == 1. See [8/9] hw/arm/smmuv3: Get prepared for range
invalidation, smmu_iotlb_inv_iova() implementation.

So my understanding is it is obviously feasible to get rid of TG/LVL in
the key but may be less optimal when range invalidation gets used by the
guest (most invalidations having num_pages == 1)
