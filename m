Well, some of them are.  At least historically both synchronous and
asnchronous MCEs were possible.  Are there really no versions where
you can report an MCE with unknown address?

How so?  AFAICT, from the point of view of the guest this is not
observably different from supporting the NMI mechanism but NMIs never
occurring.
