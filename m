This utility module builds a decision tree to decode instructions, starting from a human readable list of instruction bit patterns.
Automatic tree generation will hopefully be more efficient and more maintainable than a hand-designed opcode parser.

Tree generation happens at startup because this seemed simpler to implement than adding a new build step.

+ * # Why is this here?
+ * This decoder takes a list of human readable descriptions of instructions
+ * and uses it to build a binary decision tree used to choose translation
+ * functions for opcodes.
+ * It's built like this because figuring out the structure of AVR instructions
+ * was too hard and writing a Big Nested Switch by hand seemed too painful.
+ * This seems to be the simplest answer that doesn't use loads (>0.5MB) of RAM.
+ *
+ * # How does it work?
+ * This is based J. R. Quinlan's ID3 algorithm, tweaked to add weights to each
+ * instruction.
+ * Having a binary tree branch on opcode bits seems obvious, but the awkward
+ * part is deciding which order to test the bits.
+ * Getting the order right means that redundant bits can be ignored and fewer
+ * branches are needed; i.e. less memory and faster lookups.
+ * Here, the tests are ordered by an estimate of information gain based on
+ * Shannon Entropy.
+ * In short, we guess how much each bit tells us and pick the one that gives
+ * us most progress toward knowing which instruction we're seeing.
+ * The weights are currently only used to prioritise legal opcodes over
+ * illegal opcodes, which significantly reduces the tree size.
+ *
+ * # Why are you doing this at run time?
+ * It was easier than building and running a special purpose tool during
+ * QEMU's build process.
+ * The tree is only built once, during startup, and hopefully doesn't take long
+ * enough to be noticeable.
