This is a really good point, and I strongly agree with it.
Letting code do funny tricks at runtime is one of the reasons QOM
properties became hard to introspect.

This would be very easy to implement.

This is also a strong argument.  The QEMU code base has ~500
matches for "object*_property_add*" calls, and ~2100 for
"DEFINE_PROP*".

Converting qdev arrays to object_class_property_add_*() calls
would be a huge effort with no gains.  The end result would be
two different APIs for registering class field properties
coexisting for a long time, and people still confused on what's
the preferred API.
