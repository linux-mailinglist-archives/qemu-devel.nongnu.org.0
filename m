Thanks for the KVM_RUN explanation, that makes a lot of sense.  Though I'm
pretty sure I'm getting the live program counter value because I use the
"info registers" command in QEMU monitor and that calls
kvm_cpu_synchronize_state().  And also to be more sure, I added a few
assembly instructions into the kernel code that stored a value that
constantly incremented and the program counter into two general purpose
registers.  I was able to see both of these in QEMU monitor so the program
counter must actually be stuck at 0xfffffffc.

KVM_RUN is the ioctl which QEMU uses to tell the kernel &quot;hey, please<b=

start running the guest&quot;. The kernel will not return control to QEMU<b=
r>
(ie the syscall will not return) until something happens that needs<br>

accel/kvm/kvm-all.c:kvm_cpu_exec()). So in normal operation,<br>
QEMU will do a bunch of setup, and then call KVM_RUN, which<br>
will cause the guest to run, probably for quite a long time. The<br>
ioctl will return when the guest does some IO a QEMU-provided<br>
device, and QEMU will then do that device emulation, set up the<br>
kvm_run struct fields to hold the results of the device access,<br>
and call KVM_RUN again. The cycle continues like this until the<br>
VM is shut down. If the guest goes into an infinite loop, you<br>
should expect that KVM_RUN will never return, as there&#39;s never<br>
any need for the kernel to ask QEMU to do anything.<br>
<br>
Also important to note: before we call KVM_RUN we push<br>
the CPU register state up to the kernel (using various arch-specific<br>
ioctls), and after that the &#39;live copy&#39; of the data is in the kerne=
l,<br>
and values in the CPU state struct in QEMU are stale. We only<br>
get the up to date data out of the kernel when we need it, by<br>
calling kvm_cpu_synchronize_state(). So if your 0xfffffffc value<br>
comes from the CPU state struct and you&#39;re reading it at a<br>
point before the state has been synchronized back from the<br>
kernel it&#39;s not going to be the actual PC value.<br>
