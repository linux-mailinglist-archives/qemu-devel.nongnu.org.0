The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  vfio-pci passthrough issue after resume from suspend

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  =

  I'm running into a weird issue with the vfio-pci driver through qemu

  I use it on a laptop and I passthrough an external GPU connected via
  PCI express. In general this works well, however if the laptop has
  *ever* suspended since its last boot, then the windows guest reports
  an error 43 on the card and I get no output on the monitor that it is
  connected to. This is really weird to me since it works fine if I boot
  the latop from power-off, and hotplug the card. It's only if the
  laptop has ever suspended since it's last boot that I see this issue.
  Even if it was suspended before the card was ever hotplugged.

  In other words:
  laptop off -> boot -> hotplug GPU : works great
  laptop off -> boot -> do stuff (GPU *NOT* connected) -> sleep -> resume -=
> hotplug GPU: problem
  laptop off -> boot -> hotplug GPU -> unplug GPU -> hotplug GPU : works gr=
eat
  laptop off -> boot -> hotplug GPU -> unplug GPU -> sleep -> resume -> hot=
plug GPU: problem

  Weird stuff...

  I'm honestly not sure that vfio-pci/qemu is to blame here since there
  are so many moving parts, but im not really sure where else to report
  this to

  What I have tried is using the sysfs interface to
  remove/rescan/poweroff/etc the PCI devices in questions (graphics card
  and it's HDMI audio) and this also does help.

  QEMU version: 2.6.1

  Please let me know what other information I can provide
