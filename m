The idea of having the buffer overwritten is still seriously worrying
me. I get the idea that in theory the "worst" that should happen is
that we unexpectedly transmit newer guest memory contents. There are
so many edge cases in migration code though that I'm worried there
might be scenarios in which that is still going to cause problems.

The current migration code has a synchronization point at the end of
each iteration of the migration loop. At the end of each iteration,
the source has a guarantee that all pages from the dirty bitmap have
now been sent. With the ZEROCOPY feature we have entirely removed all
synchronization points from the source host wrt memory sending. At
best we know that the pages will have been sent if we get to close()
without seeing errors, unless we're going to explicitly track the
completion messages. The TCP re-transmit semantics are especially
worrying to me, because the re-transmit is liable to send different
data than was in the original lost TCP packet.

Maybe everything is still safe because TCP is a reliable ordered
stream, and thus eventually the dst will get the newest guest
page contents. I'm still very worried that we have code in the
source that implicitly relies on there being some synchronization
points that we've effectively removed.

A callback is fairly simple, but potentially limits performance. Reading
the kernel docs it seems they intentionally merge notifications to enable
a whole contiguous set to be processed in one go. A callback would
effectively be unmerging them requiring processing one a time. Not
sure how much this matters to our usage.

Considering that we're using TCP, we get a reliable, ordered data
stream. So there should never be a failure that requires use to
know specific IOVs to re-sent - the kernel still handles TCP
re-transmit - we just have to still have the buffer available.
As noted above though, the re-transmit is liable to send different
data than the original transmit, which worries me.

So the only errors we should get from the completion notifications
would be errors that are completely fatal for the TCP stream. So
for errors, we only need to know whether an error has ocurred or
not. The second reason for the completion notifications is for
providing a synchronization, to know when the buffer can be released
or overwritten. That is the only scenario we need to know list of
IOVs that completed.

Well it depends whether there are synchonization requirements in the
caller. For example, current migration code knows that at the end of
each iteration sending pages, that the data has all actally been
sent. With this new logic, we might have done several more iterations
of the migration loop before the data for the original iteration has
been sent. The writes() for the original iteration may well be sending
the data from the later iterations. Possibly this is ok, but it is
a clear difference in the data that will actually go out on the wire
with this code.

Maybe we need to check completions at the end of each iteration of the
migration dirtypage loop ?

Yes, that is a bug fix we need, but actually I was refering
to the later sendmsg() call. Surely we need to clear MSG_ZEROCOPY
from 'flags', if zerocopy_enabled is not set, to avoid EINVAL
from sendmsg.

I would hope it is zerocopy, in so much as the kernel can directly
use the userspace pages as the plaintext, and then the ciphertext
in kernel space can be sent directly without further copies.

What i'm not sure is whether this means it also becomes an effectively
asynchronous API for transmitting data. ie does it have the same
constraints about needing to lock pages, and not modify data in the
pages? I've not investigated it in any detail, but I don't recall
that being mentioned, and if it was the case, it would be impossible
to enable that transparently in gnutls as its a major semantic changed.

If gnutls is going to support KTLS in a way we can use, I dont want to
have any of that duplicated in QEMU code. I want to be able delegate
as much as possible to gnutls, at least so that QEMU isn't in the loop
for any crypto sensitive parts, as that complicates certification
of crypto.
