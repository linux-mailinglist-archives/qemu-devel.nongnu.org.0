For now, QEMU cannot accept images with extra bitmap data, because QEMU
isn't aware of the semantics of those fields, so we cannot even allow
the image to load, just in case.

However, we SHOULD allow qemu-img check --repair to detect such bitmaps
as corruption so that images can be scrubbed and recovered. I will add
that to my TODO list.

Meanwhile, I believe the root cause of your problem here is a data
corruption event, but it's hard to tell exactly what it might be because
of the extra_data flag ... I can try to have some patches ready for you
in January that try to "ignore" the data and analyze the rest of the
image as best as possible, which might help us see what else went wrong.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  i am using dirty bitmaps and drive-backup. It works as aspected.

  Lately, i encounter a disastrous error. There is not any information
  about that situation. I cannot reach/open/attach/info or anything with
  a qcow2 file.

  virsh version
  Compiled against library: libvirt 4.10.0
  Using library: libvirt 4.10.0
  Using API: QEMU 4.10.0
  Running hypervisor: QEMU 2.12.0

  "qemu-img: Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/test.qcow2': Bitmap
  extra data is not supported"

  what is that mean? what should i do?
  i cannot remove bitmap. i cannot open image or query.
