Be careful what happens if migration fails and you continue on the
source - is that OK - or are you going to have to flip that back somehow
(in a post_save).

Another way to do the same is to have a dummy field; tmp_cmd, and the
tmp_cmd is the thing that's actually migrated and filled by pre_save
(or use VMSTATE_WITH_TMP )

=46rom the migration point of view yes; I don't know enough about pflash
to say if it makes sense;  for example could there ever be a 00 command
really used and then you'd have to distinguish that somehow?
