+CC Dan for a question on status of Generic Ports ACPI code first ECN.
Given that was done on the mailing list I can find any public tracking
of whether it was accepted or not - hence whether we can get on with
implementation.  There hasn't been a release ACPI spec since before
that was proposed so we need that confirmation of the code first proposal
being accepted to get things moving.

Whilst this is one option, it is certainly not the case that all CXL 2.0
platforms will decide to do any setup of CXL memory (volatile or not) in the
firmware.  They can leave it entirely to the OS, so a cold plug flow.
Early platforms will do the setup in BIOS to support unware OSes, once
that's not a problem any more the only reason you'd want to do this is if
you don't have other RAM to boot the system, or for some reason you want
your host kernel etc in the CXL attached memory.

I'd expect to see BIOS having OS managed configuration as an option in the
intermediate period where some OSes are aware, others not.
OS knows more about usecase / policy so can make better choices on interleaving
etc of volatile CXL type 3 memory (let alone the fun corner of devices
where you can dynamically change the mix of volatile and non volatile
memory).

SRAT setup for CXL type 3 devices is to my mind is a job for a full BIOS,
not QEMU level of faking a few things. That BIOS should also
be doing the full configuration (HDM Decoders and all the rest).  ARM has
a prototype for one of the fixed virtual platforms that does this (talk
at Plumbers Uconf), we should look to do the same if we want to test
those flows using QEMU via appropriate changes in EDK2 to walk topology
and configure everything.  Until the devices are configured there is no
way to configure the SLIT, HMAT entries that align with the SRAT ones
(in theory those can be updated at runtime via _SLI, _HMA but in 
practice, I'm fairly sure Linux doesn't support doing that.)

For the Numa node bit...

So far, the CDAT table isn't used in Linux (read out for debug purposes
is supported only).  That all needs to be added yet to get the NUMA node
allocations to work correctly.  It shouldn't have anything to do with SRAT
unless the BIOS has done the full full configuration (same way CXL will work
with a legacy OS).  Come to think of it, that should definitely be on the
priority list for kernel support (don't think it was on the list on Tuesday?)

Agreed. This is same place as Ben's original CXL QEMU work on non volatile.
Need something to develop against so we'll at least have QEMU patches
available whilst the kernel side is in development (hopefully this cycle)

For hotplug, needs to be the region driver, not here (or BIOS if you
are doing a BIOS driven flow - in which case the whole topology is
discovered and mostly configured by the BIOS before the OS reaches it
- including filling in SRAT, SLIT, HMAT etCc).

Yup, and I doubt it ever will be for reasons above. 

BIOS does it all, or OS does it all.  Mixing and matching is a mess
(there is an exception - Generic Port entries in SRAT - those we do
need for the OS driven flow and possibly also the BIOS flow
- patches welcome! I'd forgotten that on my list of QEMU stuff that
needs doing.)

If anyone is implementing that, also good to do Generic Initiators
as they are very similar.
