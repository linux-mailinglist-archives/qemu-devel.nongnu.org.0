I fear we're getting lost in the weeds.  The question what qom-get /
qom-set / info qtree should show is of no concern to me when writing a
device model.  I need guidance on how to spread the work between
instance initialization and realize, and on the requirements for
unrealize and finalize.

Let's try to separate the self-evident parts from the unclear parts,
starting with the self-evident.  Please correct mistakes.

Object instantiation must be completely reverted by finalization.

device-introspect-test guards against a particularly egregious violation
of this rule, namely output of "info qtree" after initialization +
finalization differing from output before.  Surprisingly common issue.
It's what made Peter invite me to this thread.

Device realization must be completely reverted by unrealization.

We don't always implement unrealize.  Fine when the device cannot be
unrealized.  But the code doesn't seem to guard against omitting
unrealize when the device actually can be unrealized.

Properties for use with device_add must exist after object
instantiation.

But is that true?  Setting a property can run arbitrary code.  What if
setting property P to value V runs code that adds property Q?  Then
device_add P=3DV,Q=3DW works provided P gets set before Q, which is
anybody's guess.

So "must exist" is actually "should exist", and we' already moved from
the self-evident to the unclear.

Even less clear: what side effects may be visible between object
initialization and realization / finalization?

A safe but constricting answer would be "only host resource
reservation".

What's your answer?

I've hardly begun talking about the distribution of work between
initialization and realize, and I'm floundering already.  May I have
some clear, hard rules, please?
