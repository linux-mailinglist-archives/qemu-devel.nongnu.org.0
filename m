Hi Pavel.

Please see my answers below.

This is a question for Sara as she built it. (I think it was ATmega2560)

You are right.

Gladly.
You are welcome.
My initial intent was to provide CPU only and I hoped that others will
model the devices.

*Richard, Phil & all,*
what would be the right mechanism / procedure to split the work?
