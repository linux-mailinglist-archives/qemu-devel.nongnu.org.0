Max, did we get the logic backwards?

Hmm. Do we actually set the zero flag on unallocated clusters when=20
resizing a qcow2 image?  That would be an O(n) operation (we have to=20
visit the L2 entry for each added cluster, even if only to set the zero=20
cluster bit).  Or do we instead just rely on the fact that qcow2 is=20
inherently sparse, and that when you resize the guest-visible size=20
without writing any new clusters, then it is only subsequent guest=20
access to those addresses that finally allocate clusters, making resize=20
O(1) (update the qcow2 metadata cluster, but not any L2 tables) while=20
still reading 0 from the new data.  To some extent, that's what the=20
allocation mode is supposed to control.

What about with external data images, where a resize in guest-visible=20
length requires a resize of the underlying data image?  There, we DO=20
have to worry about whether the data image resizes with zeroes (as in=20
the filesystem) or with random data (as in a block device).
