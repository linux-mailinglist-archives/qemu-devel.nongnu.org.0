I did use patches 1 & 2 in v1 of this series, as of v2 and higher I used a
workaround for the actual 9pfs test case patches not to depend on these 2
libqos patches. This happened after Paolo's feedback, who wrote that qos
patches 1 & 2 would be useful for other, future use cases, but argued it
would not be appropriate for my intended use case:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/95ef57d0-b35e-f16a-f957-06bc3692cb7c@redhat.com/

I preserved patches 1 & 2 in this series though as he noted they might be
useful for future purposes and applied his requested changes. I personally
probably won't need thise 2 patches any time soon. So it's up to you what
shall happen with them. I don't mind if you postpone or nack them.

I'll respond to that on your patch 4 response.
