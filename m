The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  window 8 stuck during boot on Qemu

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Description of problem:
  I've got windows 8 image(64 bit), installed on Qemu(x86-64_softmmu) and t=
hen i'm trying to boot/shutdown it in the same Qemu configuration. Windows =
8 has feature - when you click "Shutdown" in UI, windows 8 doesn't actually=
 power off, it goes to "Suspend to disc" ACPI state. After shutdown, i'm tr=
ying to boot it again, but it stucks during boot.

  I've discovered, that it hangs when windows 8 writes to AHCI's command re=
gister, AHCI triggers irq, but windows 8 sends EOI, don't accessing AHCI re=
gister,so irq line stills in high state, and irq will be injected again and=
 again, while windows will send EOI on each AHCI interrupt. Strange thing i=
s that it happens only on TCG mode or =

  with option "kernel-irqchip=3Doff/split", with "kernel-irqchip=3Don" ever=
ything works ok(windows 8 accesses AHCI register and line goes to low state=
).

  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
  Qemu revision: d8276573da58e8ce78dab8c46dd660efd664bcb7

  =

  Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Install Windows 8 on QEMU(qemu command line: "-enable-kvm -m 1G -hda <=
image>  -serial stdio  -cpu core2duo -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Doff"
  2. Click shutdown in UI.
  3. Try to boot again(it will stuck)
  4. Kill Qemu and boot again, it will boot, now go to 2) :)
