Thanks Thomas for Your suggestion. Unfortunately I cannot achieve the
reconnection:

KVM runs with following parameters:

-usb -device usb-host,vendorid=3D0x04e8,productid=3D0x3242,id=3Ddrucker
-monitor unix:qemu-monitor-socket,server,nowait

With the Unix socket, I can now pipe commands to the qemu monitor. This
info command works:

echo 'info status' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info status
VM status: running

What I have is this:
- disconnect USB printer (Product Samsung ML-1510_700)
- stop KVM
- connect USB printer
- start KVM

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.1, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.2, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.3, Port 2.1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product Samsung ML-1510_700, ID: dru=
cker

Printer works.
- disconnect printer

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.4, Port 2.1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product Samsung ML-1510_700, ID: dru=
cker

USB Info still shows the printer, allthough it is disconnected.

Remove device from KVM:

echo 'device_del drucker' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket

Printer is removed from the device list:

info usbdrucker' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub

-connect printer

printer is not shown:

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub

Add printer device:

echo 'device_add usb-host,vendorid=3D0x04e8,productid=3D0x3242,id=3Ddrucker=
 ' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) device_add usb-host,vendorid=3D0x04e8,productid=3D0x3242,id=3Ddrucker

echo 'info usb' | socat - unix-connect:/qemu-monitor-socket
QEMU 4.2.0 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info usb
  Device 0.2, Port 1, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Tablet
  Device 0.3, Port 2, Speed 12 Mb/s, Product QEMU USB Hub
  Device 0.0, Port 2.2, Speed 1.5 Mb/s, Product USB Host Device, ID: drucker

Device is shown, but not like when KVM is started with connected
printer: Speed only 1.5 Mb/s, no vendor and product info.

Printer does _not_ work.

Title:
  KVM guest VM does not reattach a throughpassed USB printer from Host
  after switching printer off and on

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  =

  Host OS: Gentoo, all packages built 2014-10-01

  qemu version 2.1.0-r1

  Linux kernel 3.14.14   x86_64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3220T CPU @ 2.80GHz
  GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

  =

  Guest VM: Debian 7 (Wheezy) Linux 3.2.0 686

  =

  Start command:
  /usr/bin/qemu-system-i386 -enable-kvm -name wheezy -k de -serial null -pa=
rallel null -hda /var/kvm/wheezy.kvm-img -daemonize -net nic,macaddr=3D02:0=
0:00:00:01:31 -net tap,ifname=3Dtap3,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno -m 512 -pi=
dfile /var/run/kvm/wheezy.pid -usb -usbdevice tablet -runas myuser -vnc 127=
.0.0.1:3 -usbdevice host:04e8:3242

  Problem:
  USB printer pass-through from KVM host to guest vm only works if I start =
the qemu kvm when the USB printer (vendor/product ID 04e8:3242) is switched=
 on and therefore shown in lsusb on the host. Then it is available in the s=
tarted VM.

  But when I switch the usb printer attached to the host off, it
  disappears in lsusb both on the host and the VM (as expected) but when
  I switch the USB printer on again, it is shown on the host and also on
  the QEMU Monitor (Crtl Alt Shift 2 -> info usbhost), but in the VM
  lsusb does not show it again- so USB pass-through / hot plugging does
  not work. It worked with a previous Version of qemu (1.0 or
  something).

  That is very annoying, because every time I want to print something, I ne=
ed to shutdown the VM, start the printer, and then start the VM (which runs=
 cups as printer server).
  But after printing, I do not want the printer to keep running, so I switc=
h it off.
