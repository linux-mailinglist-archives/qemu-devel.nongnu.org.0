Yeah, we'll be able to cull this entirely very soon, including
both the C backcompat code and CI jobs at the same time, so I'll
just wait.

Yep, that looks similar to what we do in libvirt, though we don't override
the compiler at the job level. Instead we just ensure the dir containing
ccache symlinks appears first in $PATH.

So in containers we have this:

https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/blob/master/ci/containers/centos-8.Dockerfile

and in gitlab-ci.yml we have env vars set

  export CCACHE_BASEDIR="$(pwd)"
  export CCACHE_DIR="$CCACHE_BASEDIR/ccache"
  export CCACHE_MAXSIZE="500M"
  export PATH="$CCACHE_WRAPPERSDIR:$PATH"

And per-job caches:

  cache:
    paths:
      - ccache/
    key: "$CI_JOB_NAME"

note the "key" is important to avoid clashing caches from different
envs.

Regards,
Daniel
