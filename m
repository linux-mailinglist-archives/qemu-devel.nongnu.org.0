Yes 247 fits just fine. The 240 came up as extra space in case we expand
the rscpi even more in the future.

I used the

The SCCB_SIZE - sizeof(ReadInfo)) / sizeof(CPUEntry) < S390_MAX_CPUS

calculation as an example of what we could do if the SCCB_SIZE ever
increases (it would allow older machines to retroactively allow diag318
if they can also support a larger SCCB... but thinking out loud, there
might be many more moving parts that would make this preemptive approach
too tricky to implement today).
