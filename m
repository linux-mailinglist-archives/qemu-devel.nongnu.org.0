Yes, Python patches are not forgotten... they have been haunting me
every day and night for the last few months.  I have a *lot* of blame
to take here, so my sincere apologies.

One word of hope is that my resources (which were exhausted during the
last months towards the Avocado 82.0 LTS release, released last week)
are now freed.  And *a lot* of the Avocado features were eyeing QEMU,
so it's just natural that I will (because I want and have to) get
back to being more active and responsive.

ACK.  This is a good real example of my previous abstract explanation
above.

So, besides me getting back with more resources to review and maintain
the Python pathes, I have also requested Willian Rampazzo (thanks!) to
keep an eye on those patches and help with reviews.

So while more help is always welcome, I do sincerely hope with myself
and Willian back into the loop, the Python patches won't lag behind
anymore.

And thanks for raising the awareness of the issue Phil!
