Guest code is not part of QEMU.  We don't say that SeaBIOS, SLOF, etc. 
are part of QEMU; it constitutes mere aggregation with the GPLv2 QEMU 
sources, so it _is_ possible to distribute APSL2 guest code with QEMU.  
IANAL, but I'm fairly sure about this.

However I agree that LICENSE needs to be updated, something like this:

diff --git a/LICENSE b/LICENSE
