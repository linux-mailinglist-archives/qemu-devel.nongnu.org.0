That's an interesting idea. Using InetSocketAddress would mean that we could
get support for this enabled "for free" everywhere in QEMU that uses an
InetSocketAddress as its master config format.

Of course there's plenty of places not using InetSocketAddress that would
still require some glue to wire up the code which converts the custom
format into InetSocketAddress
