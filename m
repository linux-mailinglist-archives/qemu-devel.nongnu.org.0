The NO_FALLBACK changes were based on the Linux code rather than
documentation because no interface is explicitly documented to forbid
fallbacks.

I think for file systems, we can generally assume that we don't get
fallbacks because for file systems, just deallocating blocks is the
easiest way to implement the function anyway. (Hm, or is it when we
don't punch holes...?)

And for block devices, we don't try FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE because it also
involves the same slow fallback as BLKZEROOUT. In other words,
bdrv_co_pwrite_zeroes() with NO_FALLBACK, but without MAY_UNMAP, always
fails on Linux block devices, and we fall back to emulation in user
space.

We would need a kernel interface that calls blkdev_issue_zeroout() with
BLKDEV_ZERO_NOUNMAP | BLKDEV_ZERO_NOFALLBACK, but no such interface
exists.

When I talked to some file system people, they insisted that "efficient"
or "fast" wasn't well-defined enough for them or something, so if we
want to get a kernel change, maybe a new block device ioctl would be the
most realistic thing.

We do use FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE | FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE for MAY_UNMAP,
which works for both file systems (I assume - each file system has a
separate implementation) and block devices without slow fallbacks.

qemu-img create sets MAY_UNMAP, so the case we are most interested in is
covered with a fast implementation.

Hm, the original case came from Nir, maybe he can suggest something.

You'll definitely need a block device that doesn't support
FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, otherwise you can't trigger the fallback. My
first though was a loop device, but this actually does support the
operation and passes it through to the underlying file system. So maybe
if you know a file system that doesn't support it. Or if you have an old
hard disk handy.

Or... Actually there is an easily available block device that doesn't
suppport zero writes: The in-kernel NBD client! :-)

And I think I remember now how I tested this back then:

1. qemu-nbd exports an image with very slow throttling enabled
   (throttling affects writes, but not write_zeroes)

2. Attach the NBD device to /dev/nbd0

3. Convert to there (use a second NBD connection to test the fix)

Right, this should be moved inside the if (!NO_FALLBACK) block.
