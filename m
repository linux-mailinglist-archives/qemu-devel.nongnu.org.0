Punting bug fixes to a later release is always kind of sad, but getting
that many patches reviewed properly in time for -rc2 feels hopeless, and
the bugs old and unthreatending on first glance.

I'm okay with punting the whole series to 5.1.

We have quite some Error work pending for 5.1.  Beware of conflicts.

In particular, I now plan to make object_property_set() & friends return
a useful value.  This should make your patches a bit smaller.
