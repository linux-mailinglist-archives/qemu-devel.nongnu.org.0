Anyway, the underlying problem is that the phy chips are not connected
to the MDIO bus associated with each Ethernet controller. In other words,
unlike the current imx fec emulation suggests, there is no 1:1 connection
between Ethernet and phy. This is even mentioned in commit 461c51ad42
("Add a phy-num property to the i.MX FEC emulator"):

"As an example with the i.MX6UL the NXP SOC has 2 Ethernet devices but
 only one MDIO bus on which the 2 related PHY are connected but at unique
 addresses."

Unfortunately that commit doesn't actually solve the problem where 2 Ethernet
devices are connected to a single MDIO bus; it just adds support for setting
the phy address.

I have no idea how to solve that in a clean way in qemu.
