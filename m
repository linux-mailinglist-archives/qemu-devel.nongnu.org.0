I based this patch on performance results and my measurements say that 
tcg implementation is still significantly superior to helper 
implementation, regardless of somewhat large number of instructions.

I can attach both performance measurements results and disassembly of 
both helper and tcg implementations, if you want me to do this.

I agree with this, but currently we don't have this implemented in tcg, 
so I worked with what I have.

Kind Regards,
