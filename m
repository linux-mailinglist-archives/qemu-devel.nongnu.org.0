This is implementing the host side of the net_failover concept
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/net_failover.html)

Changes since v2:
* back out of creating failover pair when it is a non-networking
  vfio-pci device (Alex W)
* handle migration state change from within the migration thread. I do a
  timed wait on a semaphore and then check if all unplugs were
  succesful. Added a new function to each device that checks the device
  if the unplug for it has happened. When all devices report the succesfu=
l
  unplug *or* the time/retries is up, continue with the migration or
  cancel. When not all devices could be unplugged I am cancelling at the
  moment. It is likely that we can't plug it back at the destination whic=
h
  would result in degraded network performance.
* fix a few bugs regarding re-plug on migration source and target=20
* run full set of tests including migration tests
* add patch for libqos to tolerate new migration state
* squashed patch 1 and 2, added patch 8=20
=20
The general idea is that we have a pair of devices, a vfio-pci and a
virtio-net device. Before migration the vfio device is unplugged and data
flows to the virtio-net device, on the target side another vfio-pci devic=
e
is plugged in to take over the data-path. In the guest the net_failover
module will pair net devices with the same MAC address.

* Patch 1 adds the infrastructure to hide the device for the qbus and qde=
v APIs

* Patch 2 sets a new flag for PCIDevice 'partially_hotplugged' which we
  use to skip the unrealize code path when doing a unplug of the primary
  device

* Patch 3 sets the pending_deleted_event before triggering the guest
  unplug request

* Patch 4 and 5 add new qmp events, one sends the device id of a device
  that was just requested to be unplugged from the guest and another one
  to let libvirt know if VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY was negotiated

* Patch 6 make sure that we can unplug the vfio-device before
  migration starts

* Patch 7 adds a new migration state that is entered while we wait for
  devices to be unplugged by guest OS

* Patch 8 just adds the new migration state to a check in libqos code

* Patch 9 In the second patch the virtio-net uses the API to defer adding=
 the vfio
  device until the VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY feature is acked. It also
  implements the migration handler to unplug the device from the guest an=
d
  re-plug in case of migration failure

* Patch 10 allows migration for failover vfio-pci devices, but only when =
it is
  a networking device=20

Previous discussion:
  RFC v1 https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/989098/
  RFC v2 https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg606906.htm=
l
  v1: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg03968.html
  v2: https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg635214.html

To summarize concerns/feedback from previous discussion:
1.- guest OS can reject or worse _delay_ unplug by any amount of time.
  Migration might get stuck for unpredictable time with unclear reason.
  This approach combines two tricky things, hot/unplug and migration.
  -> We need to let libvirt know what's happening. Add new qmp events
     and a new migration state. When a primary device is (partially)
     unplugged (only from guest) we send a qmp event with the device id. =
When
     it is unplugged from the guest the DEVICE_DELETED event is sent.
     Migration will enter the wait-unplug state while waiting for the gue=
st
     os to unplug all primary devices and then move on with migration.
2. PCI devices are a precious ressource. The primary device should never
  be added to QEMU if it won't be used by guest instead of hiding it in
  QEMU.
  -> We only hotplug the device when the standby feature bit was
     negotiated. We save the device cmdline options until we need it for
     qdev_device_add()
     Hiding a device can be a useful concept to model. For example a
     pci device in a powered-off slot could be marked as hidden until the=
 slot is
     powered on (mst).
3. Management layer software should handle this. Open Stack already has
  components/code to handle unplug/replug VFIO devices and metadata to
  provide to the guest for detecting which devices should be paired.
  -> An approach that includes all software from firmware to
     higher-level management software wasn't tried in the last years. Thi=
s is
     an attempt to keep it simple and contained in QEMU as much as possib=
le.
     One of the problems that stopped management software and libvirt fro=
m
     implementing this idea is that it can't be sure that it's possible t=
o
     re-plug the primary device. By not freeing the devices resources in =
QEMU
     and only asking the guest OS to unplug it is possible to re-plug the
     device in case of a migration failure.
4. Hotplugging a device and then making it part of a failover setup is
   not possible
  -> addressed by extending qdev hotplug functions to check for hidden
     attribute, so e.g. device_add can be used to plug a device.


I have tested this with a mlx5 and igb NIC and was able to migrate the VM=
.

Command line example:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 3072 -smp 3 \
        -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Dsplit -cpu host   \
        -serial stdio   \
        -net none \
        -qmp unix:/tmp/qmp.socket,server,nowait \
        -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot0,multifunction=3Don,chassis=3D0,=
addr=3D0xa \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot1,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D1 \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot2,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D2 \
        -netdev tap,script=3D/root/bin/bridge.sh,downscript=3Dno,id=3Dhos=
tnet1,vhost=3Don \
        -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet1,id=3Dnet1,mac=3D52:54:00=
:6f:55:cc,bus=3Droot2,failover=3Don \
	-device vfio-pci,host=3D5e:00.2,id=3Dhostdev0,bus=3Droot1,net_failover_p=
air_id =3Dnet1 \
        /root/rhel-guest-image-8.0-1781.x86_64.qcow2

I'm grateful for any remarks or ideas!

Thanks!
