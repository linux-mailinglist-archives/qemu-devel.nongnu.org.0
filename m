So if we can't mandate this or there's no way to validate this. Vendor 
is still free to implement their own protocol which could lead a lot of 
maintaining burden.

For VFIO-user, how management know that a VM can be migrated from src to 
dst? For kernel, we have sysfs.

It looks worse than 
"pci://vendor_id.device_id.subvendor_id.subdevice_id". "e1000e" means a 
lot of different 8275X implementations that have subtle but easy to be 
ignored differences.

And is it possible to have a list of URIs here?

Do we allow the migration from "rx-filter-size=16" to 
"rx-filter-size=32" (I guess not?) And should we extend the concept to 
"device capability" instead of just state representation.  E.g src has 
CAP_X=on,CAP_Y=off but dst has CAP_X=on,CAP_Y=on, so we disallow the 
migration from src to dst.

Yes, but the task needs to be done by management somehow. So do you 
expect a vendor specific provisioning API here?

I'm not sure how to apply the device versions consider the device state 
is opaque or the device needs to export another API to do this?

In qemu we have subsection to facilitate the case when some fields were 
forgot to migrate. Do we need something similar here?
