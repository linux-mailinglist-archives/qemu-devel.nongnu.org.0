Yes, the x509 cert validation is precisely the reason.

The client must validate the hostname it is connecting to, against
the x509 certificate received from the server. If it doesn't use
IP, then it had no hostnmae to validate the cert against.

Since that time though, we added support for PSK credentials with
TLS which requires no hostname validation, so the restriction no
longer makes sense.

Adding ability to set a tls-hostname parameter further enables its
use with x509 credentials.

It is a bit complex to debug this because unfortunately gnutls API
doesn't allow us to propagate the root cause error accurately.

We return ECONNABORTED when GNUTLS reports GNUTLS_E_PREMATURE_TERMINATION.
It reports this when it tries to read a packet header and gets EOF from
the socket.

We return EIO in other cases where there's no GNUTLS error code we
want to handle explicitly. With some debugging I find that GNUTLS
is returned GNUTLS_E_PULL_ERROR which is a generic code it returns
whenever the read() callback fails for a reason which isn't EAGAIN.

With more debugging I find the original recvfrom() is returning
ECONNRESET, so this is basically just another name for EOF.

I'm curious why we see EOF sometimes and ECONNRESET at other times.
I disabled the qio_channel_shutdown call on the server and that just
changed to a different race. Now we sometimes get ECONNRESET, and
sometimes get EIO when trying to send the first NBD option header
instead.

I'm not sure there is a bug - it feels like there's just a few different
shutdown scenarios we can hit based on timing, due to the fact there is
no synchronization with the client when we drop the connection if
authz fails.

We don't need to forbid this. Consider if you have setup an SSH tunnel
from localhost:someport, over to your remote server. NBD will get told
to connect to localhost, but will need to validate the cert against
the real remote hostname.

I don't think we need any of this switch, instead just something like thus:

   hostname = qemu_opt_get(opts, "tls-hostname");
   if (!hostname) {
       if (s->saddr->type == SOCKET_ADDRESS_TYPE_INET) {
           hostname  = s->sadddr->u.inet.host;
       } else {
           error_setg(errp,  "tls-hostname is required for non-IP sockets");
	   goto error;
       }
   }

I was a bit confused by the "bindto" name being used as the hostname
to connect to for the --list client. Perhas we should rename it to
something neutral - just hostname perhaps.
