Yeah, there can indeed be a difference between a pre-zeroing which can 
be super-fast (on a posix file, truncate to 0 and back to the desired 
size, for example), and where it is faster than writes but still slower 
than a single pass.

Is the kernel able to tell us reliably when we can perform a fast 
pre-zero pass?  If it can't, it's that much harder to define when 
BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK makes a difference.

I'm still hoping to revive my work on making bdrv_make_zero a per-driver 
callback with smarts for the fastest possible pre-zeroing that driver is 
capable of, or fast failure when BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK is set and it is 
no faster to pre-zero than it is to just write zeroes when needed.  I 
can certainly construct NBD scenarios in either direction (where a 
pre-zeroing pass is faster because of less network traffic, or where a 
pre-zeroing pass is slower because of increased I/O - in fact, that was 
part of my KVM Forum 2019 demo on why the NBD protocol added a FAST_ZERO 
flag mirroring the idea of qemu's BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK).

Matching what we recently did with --target-is-zero.
