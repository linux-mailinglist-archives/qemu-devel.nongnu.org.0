Basically it covers everything that isn't yet covered by
bdrv_inc/dec_in_flight() on the node level, but completion is probably
the most important part.

Start, too, because actually something very interesting is happening
between blk_aio_prwv() and blk_do_*(): It uses bdrv_coroutine_enter(),
which in some circumstances may end up only scheduling the coroutine
instead of immediately entering it.
