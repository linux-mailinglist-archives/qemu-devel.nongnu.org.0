Actually, even for a backing file, I think bs->probed should be set, so
the raw driver would return an I/O error if you write the magic of an
image format to the first sector. We should just add a test case to
verify this behaviour for backing files (e.g. in the context of a commit
job).

Of course, if you edit the backing file outside of QEMU, that's your
problem.

This plan makes sense to me.
