Yes, of course.

xen_device_backend_scanf, xs_node_vscanf, xs_node_scanf,=20
xen_device_frontend_scanf

Maybe more. The compiler can tell you missing attributes.

No, because we don't want lots of conditional code with different format=20
strings for POSIX and Windows (I made that commit 9 years ago).

I could do that when adding the new macro, but would like to hear more=20
opinions on that.

Thank you,
