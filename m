Title:
  QEMU aarch64 can't run Windows ARM64 iso's

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  Hi,
  recently Windows ARM64 ISOs have been posted on the internet..
  just checked with latest QEMU 2.10 release from =

  https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/qemu-w64-setup-20170830.exe =

  "h:\qemu\qemu-system-aarch64.exe" -boot d -cdrom h:\iso\16353.1000.170825=
-1423.RS_PRERELEASE_CLIENTPRO_OEMRET_ARM64FRE_ES-ES.ISO -m 2048 -cpu cortex=
-a57 -smp 1 -machine virt
  seems no video output..
  checked various machine options for example versatilepb (says guest has n=
ot initialized the guest)..

  so don't know if it's a QEMU bug or lacking feature but can support
  running Windows ARM64 builds (would be nice if you can add a
  Snapdragon835 machine type which is which first machines will be
  running..)

  =

  note running a Windows x64 ISO with similar parameters works (removing -c=
pu and -machine as not needed)

  thanks..
