Hello, Peter.

My intented meaning (of my Acked-by) is:

=E2=80=9CI agree that this patch is valuable in general, I took a look at t=
he code
changes and they look good to me implementation-wise, but I am not a
reviewer nor an expert in rst and related areas, so I am not comfortable
=E2=80=9Creviewing-it-by=E2=80=9D - however as a potential user/writer of r=
st files, I want
to acknowledge the significance and the rightness of the patch by
=E2=80=9Cacking-it-by=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=9D

I am not sure how it fits in other definitions, but I am comfortable with
your changing my =E2=80=9CAcked-by=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9CReviewed-by=E2=80=
=9D, leaving it as is, or changing
it to nothing- whatever you deem being suitable.

The same applies to the other patch of this series, of course.

Yours,
Aleksandar
