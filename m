The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Qemu evdev multiple guests/host switch

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hello,

  Qemu up to version 3.1

  it would be nice if passed through evdev can be switched (using lctrl
  + rctrl) through all running guests configured for evdev passthrough
  and the host. Currently, only the last started guest and host can be
  switched only so the previously started guests can't be controlled.
