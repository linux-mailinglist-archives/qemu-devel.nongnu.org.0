The virtiofs security guide that Stefan wrote doesn't really fit in the exi=
sting ones.
It's not about the use of qemu itself so it's not docs/user or
docs/system.
It's not specifying protocols or commands so it's not docs/interop.
It's not hardware.
And it's for end users not developers, so it's not docs/devel.

However, there's a question about whether it makes sense to bundle
the docs for all of the tools into one big manual when they're
really independent.

Dave
