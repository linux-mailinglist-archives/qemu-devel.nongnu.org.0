Qemu still waits. This will not work in my case, as the endpoint VMs could =
start and stop at any time, and I don't even know how many network interfac=
es the endpoint VMs will have.

The "server" mode simply creates a listen socket instead of connecting.
It does not mean that QEMU acts as the vhost-user device backend. QEMU
is still the frontend. The UNIX domain socket "client" and "server"
relationship is independent of the vhost-user protocol frontend
(previously called "master") and device backend (previously called
"slave") relationship.

=A0thinking that I could at least start the packet-switching VM, and then l=
et the DPDK app inside it do the forwarding of the packets. But from what I=
 understand, this creates a single network interface inside the VM on which=
 the DPDK app can bind. The limitation here is that if another VM wants to =
connect to the packet-switching VM, I need to manually add another virtio-v=
host-user-pci device (and a new vhost-user.sock) before this packet-switchi=
ng VM starts, so this is not dynamic.

Yes, each switch port needs its own virtio-vhost-user device because it
is the partner to a VM's virtio-net device.

It is possible to write a guest application that:

1. Opens multiple virtio-vhost-user devices and handles the connection
   lifecycle so that devices may be disconnected some of the time.

and/or

2. Reacts to virtio-vhost-user hotplug (i.e. udev/uevents) to
   dynamically add/remove ports.

 not fully understand how it=C2=A0works, but I think it presents a network =
interface to the guest kernel after another VM connects to the first one.

This also requires multiple vhost-pci device instances if you want
multiple switch ports.

> > I realize I made a big story and probably don't make too much sense, bu=
t one more thing. The ideal solution for me would be a combination of the v=
host-user socket and the vhost-pci socket. The Qemu will start the VM and t=
he socket will wait in the background for vhost-user connections. When a ne=
w connection is established, Qemu should create a hot-plugable PCI network =
card and either the guest kernel or the DPDK app inside to handle the vhost=
-user messages.

vhost-pci and virtio-vhost-user don't present a network card to the
switch. Instead the switch acts as the device emulator for the
virtio-net NICs that other VMs are using. This has performance
advantages because no data copy and extra packet queuing is necessary
when there is just 1 NIC instead of 2 point-to-point NICs.
