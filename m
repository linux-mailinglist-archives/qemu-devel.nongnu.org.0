Another criteria might be: Do we have a tcg, qtest or acceptance test to
check that the target is still working?

- avr has an acceptance test

- cris has tcg tests

- lm32 has tcg tests

- microblaze has acceptance tests (and one trivial qtest)

- moxie ... has only one very trivial qtest (boot-serial-test)

- nios2 has an acceptance test

- tilegx does not have any tests at all

- unicore32 does not have any tests at all
  (not counting the trivial machine-none-test)

So from that point of view, unicore32, tilegx and moxie are the
candidates for deprecation.

Ok, good idea, I'll try to write a mail later today.
