Yes, I think this would be a good idea.  KVM Forum is probably later
than we want, plus since it is virtual, I probably won't be shifting
into the right timezone to attend much of it.

I don't know when that Tuesday KVM call is.  Generally the best
available time for Australia/Europe meetings this time of year is 9am
CET / 5pm AEST.  As a once off I could go somewhat later into my
evening, though.
