Yes, the QMP dispatcher still processes one request after another. The
only visible effect should be that the guest and other background tasks
aren't blocked.

Marc-Andr=E9's first proposal (maybe two years ago) actually added real
asynchronous commands to the protocol. But his latest versions gave up
on this and made commands only internally asynchronous, with pretty much
the same effect as this series.

If we ever do want to extend the protocol to have async commands on the
protocol level, this can still be done on top. There is no fundamental
problem that would prevent just launching a coroutine for each parallel
request. In fact, this series is probably the first step that you would
make anyway to even have something that can be parallelised.
