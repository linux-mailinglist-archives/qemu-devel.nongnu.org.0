No, they can be proprietary formats that neither the Linux kernel nor
userspace can parse. For example, look at linux-firmware
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.gi=
t/about/)
it's just a collection of binary blobs. The format is not necessarily
public. The only restriction on that repo is that the binary blob must
be redistributable and users must be allowed to run them (i.e.
proprietary licenses can be used).

Or look at other passthrough device interfaces like /dev/i2c or libusb.
They expose data to userspace without requiring a defined format. It's
the same as VFIO.

In addition, look at kernel uAPIs where userspace acts simply as a data
transport for opaque data (e.g. where a userspace helper facilitates
communication but has no visibility of the data). I imagine that memory
encryption relies on this because the host kernel and userspace do not
have access to encrypted memory or associated state - but they need to
help migrate them to other hosts.

I hope these examples show that such APIs don't pose a problem for the
Linux uAPI and are already in use. VFIO device state isn't doing
anything new here.

I will send a separate email that describes how VFIO live migration can
work in more detail. I think it's possible to do it with existing ioctl
interface that Kirti has proposed and still prevent the risk of
incorrectly interpreting data that you have pointed out.

The document that I'm sending will allow us to discuss in more detail
and make the approach clearer.
