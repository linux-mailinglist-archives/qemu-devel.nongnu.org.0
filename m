Yes, but if you specify any <backingStore> including the terminator you
basically configure the image chain yourselves. The part which is
configured explicitly will not undergo any form of detection, not even
looking for the backing file.

I assume you meant that none of the 'qcow2' files have format of the
backing file recorded in the metadata.

1) was working before, but is now forbidden
2) was working before, and is now forbidden
3,4) were possibly working (without sVirt), or would get permission
denied reported by qemu during startup, currently they are forbidden by
a libvirt error message

After this patch:
1) will be fixed by this patch
2) will be fixed by this patch
3, 4) will report a libvirt error rather than relying on sVirt or others

Pre-blockdev and post-blockdev every scenario of the above is working.
We can't even inspect the top file for backing store so everything is
just ignored.

Now what partially changes is when we have something introspectable in
the way:

1,2) file:top.qcow2 -> iscsi:base.whatever

The current code would report an error if the format was not recorded
in the overlay (top.qcow2) and we can't introspect the backing file
we'll reject it.

This can be relaxed though.

3,4) will work if top.qcow2 has the format but any subsequent don't since
we don't introspect it

It fixes also gluster since the backends for that are already
implemented.

I'll post another rebased version with some updated docs and one fix. We
can continue there perhaps.
