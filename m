I still hope that we'll convert bs->total_sectors to something based on
bytes so we can actually handle byte-granularity image sizes, but for
the time being, I guess this fix makes sense (though we don't have the
check in other drivers which have the same problem).

A qcow2 image should be able to provide an image for any disk the user
wants to expose to the guest, and 4k alignment would certainly limit
that ability. I suspect that if CHS geometry matters for a guest, not
having a 4k aligned size is actually quite likely.
