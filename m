I think the question does matter. Reusing existing code is not an end in
itself, but it has to actually improve something. Usually this would be
simplifying the code because a lot of the work is done by something
external now.

"The job" is defining APIs in a way that we they describe JSON messages
and we can generate C boilerplate code and documentation from the
description.

If we look for a standard format, then we should start with this rather
than keeping the non-standard thing that we have, but wrapping a new
syntax around it.

I'm not worried about the work to convert the QAPI generator.
QAPISchemaParser is 264 lines of code, presumably not a lot of work to
rewrite. This is also the upper limit of code that could be improved.

Given the discussion so far, I wouldn't even be sure that the diffstat
after pulling in an external dependeny would be at least minimally
favourable.

More time will be spent with dealing with the results of the actual
conversion of the schema file because people will get lots of merge
conflicts.

Sometimes this is worth it, but then the benefit has to be a little more
than just that we could say we've reused an external library.

The differences between JSON and the QAPI schema lower layer language is
structured documentation comments (I don't think any of the proposed
alternatives have this - might be a compelling benefit) and having
multiple objects in a single file (I would rather put brackets around
the whole file and commas between each definition and live with that
ugliness than taking the pain of a merge conflicts).

I doubt documentation comments and having multiple objects in a single
file makes QEMU less attractice to contribute to.

Almost every subsystem has some QAPI parts that would be affected.

If it's an actual duplicate and exact match, sure. But if using the GLib
functions results in double the code size that implementing the
functionality from scratch was, it becomes questionable in my opinion.
