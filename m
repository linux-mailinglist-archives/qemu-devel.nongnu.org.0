OK - but that doesn't give you any way to figure out 'why' it failed;
I guess I was expecting you to then read an 'error' register to find
out what happened.
Assuming the write() to transition to stop-and-copy fails and you're
still in pre-copy, what's the defined thing you're supposed to do next?
Decide migration has failed and then do a write() to transition to running?
