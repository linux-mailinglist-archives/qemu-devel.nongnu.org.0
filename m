If you avoid the resize, it should be ok for both precopy & postcopy.

But, as you point, if acpi guest is the one changing sizes, we are in
trouble.  But really, it makes exactly zero sense to reset during
migrate.  if we _could_ catch the reset, the "intelligent" thing to do
is:

- detect reset
- launch guest on destination from zero.

I.e. not migration at all.  This would be my "better" idea, but I have
no clue how to catch that kind of things in a sane way that works in
every architecture.

You get the:

because:
- your code change makes sense
- the documentation update is good.

Thanks, Juan.
