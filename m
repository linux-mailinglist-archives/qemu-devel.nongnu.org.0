Did we ever arrive at a conclusion for a good definition?

I mean I can give a definition like "it's coroutine safe if it results
in the right behaviour even when called in coroutine context", but
that's not really helpful.

FWIW, I would also have a hard time giving a much better definition than
this for thread safety.

Yes, it must *always* be called from coroutine context. This is the
reason why I included HMP after all, even though I'm really mostly just
interested in QMP.

When the command handler tries to yield and it's not in coroutine
context, it will abort(). If it never tries to yield, I think it would
just work - but of course, the ability to yield is the only reason why
you would want to run a command handler in a coroutine.
