Thanks a lot for this documentation, I could learn new things,
use cases out of my interest area. Useful as a developer to
better understand how are used the areas I'm coding. This
shorten a bit that gap between developers and users.

What would be more valuable than a developer review/feedback is
having feedback from users and technical writers.
Suggestion: also share it on qemu-discuss@nongnu.org which is
less technical (maybe simply repost the cover and link to the
Wiki).

--

What is not obvious in this cover (and the documents pasted on
the list) is there are schema pictures on the Wiki pages which
are not viewable and appreciable via an email post.

I had zero knowledge on Kubernetes. I have been confused by their
use in the introduction...

From Index:

"The intended audience is people who are familiar with the traditional
virtualization stack (QEMU plus libvirt), and in order to make it
more approachable to them comparisons, are included and little to no
knowledge of KubeVirt or Kubernetes is assumed."

Then in Architecture's {Goals and Components} there is an assumption
Kubernetes is known. Entering in Components, Kubernetes is briefly
but enough explained.

Then KubeVirt is very well explained.

--

Sometimes the "Other topics" category is confusing, it seems out
of the scope of the "better understanding and documenting the
interactions between KubeVirt and KVM" and looks like left over
notes. I.e.:

"Another possibility is to leverage the device-mapper from Linux to
provide features such as snapshots and even like Incremental Backup.
For example, dm-era seems to provide the basic primitives for
bitmap tracking.
This could be part of scenario number 1, or cascaded with other PVs
somewhere else.
Is this already being used? For example, cybozu-go/topolvm is a
CSI LVM Plugin for k8s."

"vhost-user-blk in other CSI backends
Would it make sense for other CSI backends to implement support for
vhost-user-blk?"

"The audience is people who are familiar with the traditional
virtualization stack (QEMU plus libvirt)". Feeling part of the
audience, I have no clue how to answer these questions...
I'd prefer you tell me :)

Maybe renaming the "Other topics" section would help.
"Unanswered questions", "Other possibilities to investigate",...

--

Very good contribution in documentation,

Thanks!

Phil.
