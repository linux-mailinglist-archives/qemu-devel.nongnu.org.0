From the top of my mind, this is the pain point when trying to use GObject:
- static/inlined object, not supported by GObject, unlikely to ever be
- few users in qemu, transition possible.
- 64k limit of GObject, for some reason, unlikely to change but I will
take a look. Some users in qemu, code adaptation possible.
- dynamic properties, possible in GObject with hacks, but not
recommended and going to be deprecated from what I remember
- "array" properties - would need extra layer/tweaks for compatibility
- link properties - would need special handling
- different limitations for type names and properties names

A possible initial approach is to have all the type system and object
allocation done by GObject under the hood (what I hacked), while
keeping all the properties handled by QOM. Then, figure out a
migration to GObject properties (which are also being refactored a bit
upstream). If there is enough interest, I will keep investigating. But
for now, helping with meson seems more urgent.
