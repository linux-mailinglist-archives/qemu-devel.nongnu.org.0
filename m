AFAIK, Google will index closed bugs, so they'll still appear in the
search results.

If we really want to, we could put a comment in the bugs we're about
to close, telling people that we're using gitlab now, and to re-file
their bug there if they care about it. I'm not sure that's needed
though, since it is no different a situation to what we have already
with the 1000's of bugs we've closed over the years.

IMHO they can just file a fresh bug in GitLab from scratch easily
enough by just copy+pasting the existin bug description. I don't
see a benefit in creating 100's of bugs in GitLab that we will
immediately close as being stale.
