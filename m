@Andreas - If we find nothing else to try I'll ping you when I have a
newer qemu&libvirt build for Ubuntu 20.10 for you to try.

Title:
  KVM Win 10 guest pauses after kernel upgrade

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hello!
  Unfortunately the bug has apparently reappeared. I have a Windows 10 runn=
ing in a VM, which after my today's "apt upgrade" goes into pause mode afte=
r a few seconds of running time.

  Until yesterday it used to work and I was able to boot the VM. During
  the kernel update (from 5.4.0-28.33 to 5.4.0-29.34) the VM was active
  and then went into pause mode. Even after a reboot of my host system
  the problem still persists: the VM boots for a few seconds and then
  switches to pause mode.

  Current Kernel: Linux andreas-laptop 5.4.0-29-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP
  Wed Apr 29 14:32:27 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

  Maybe relevant logfile lines:
