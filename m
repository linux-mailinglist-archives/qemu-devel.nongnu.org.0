I usually put the commit messages to a spellchecker, but this time
I forgot to do this. I will try not to in the future.

I think I didn't wrote the double negative correctly here.
I meant a write that doesn't cover first sector fully and doesn't cover second sector.
I'll just write it like that I guess.

I actually meant to write 'area' here. I just haven't proofed the commit
message at all I confess. Next time I do better.
