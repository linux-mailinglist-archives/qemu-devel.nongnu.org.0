Common code for dealing with encryption, backing files, and so on.  It=20
felt like I had a lot of code repetition when keeping functions separate.

The qemu-img.c caller in patch 10 checks ZERO_CREATE | ZERO_OPEN, so we=20
DO have situations of checking more than one bit, vs. needing two=20
function calls.

In looking at the rest of the series, drivers were either completely=20
trivial (in which case, declaring:

.bdrv_has_zero_init =3D bdrv_has_zero_init_1,
.bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate =3D bdrv_has_zero_init_1,

was a lot wordier than the new:

.bdrv_known_zeroes =3D bdrv_known_zeroes_truncate,

), or completely spelled out but where both creation and truncation were=20
determined in the same amount of effort.

True, but only to a minor extent; and the documentation mentions that=20
the BDRV_ZERO_OPEN calculation MUST NOT be as expensive as a blind=20
block_status loop.  Meanwhile, callers tend to only care about=20
bdrv_known_zeroes() right after opening an image or right before=20
resizing (not repeatedly during runtime); and you also argued elsewhere=20
in this thread that it may be worth having the block layer cache=20
BDRV_ZERO_OPEN and update the cache on any write, at which point, the=20
expense in the driver callback really is a one-time call during=20
bdrv_co_open().  And in that case, whether the one-time expense is done=20
via a single function call or via three driver callbacks, the amount of=20
work is the same; but the driver callback interface is easier if there=20
is only one callback (similar to how bdrv_unallocated_blocks_are_zero()=20
calls bdrv_get_info() only for bdi.unallocated_blocks_are_zero, even=20
though BlockDriverInfo tracks much more than that boolean).

In fact, it may be worth consolidating known zeroes support into=20
BlockDriverInfo.

Those are still viable options, but before I repaint the bikeshed along=20
those lines, I'd at least like a review of whether the overall idea of=20
having a notion of 'reads-all-zeroes' is indeed useful enough,=20
regardless of how we implement it as one vs. three driver callbacks.
