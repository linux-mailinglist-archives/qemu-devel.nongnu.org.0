I think so!

This has come up before:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/59C139D0.3040507@arm.com

I agree Qemu should opt-in to this, it needs to be a feature that is enabled.

I had an early version of something like this for testing SDEI before there was firmware
available. The review feedback from Christoffer was that it should include HVC and SMC,
their immediates, and shouldn't be tied to SMC-CC ranges.

I think this should be a catch-all as Heyi describes to deliver 'unhandled SMC/HVC' to
user-space as hypercall exits. We should include the immediate in the struct.

We can allow Qemu to disable the in-kernel PSCI implementation, which would let it be done
in user-space via this catch-all mechanism. (PSCI in user-space has come up on another
thread recently). The in-kernel PSCI needs to be default-on for backwards compatibility.

As Mark points out, the piece that's left is the 'arch workaround' stuff. We always need
to handle these in the kernel. I don't think these should be routed-back, they should be
un-obtainable by user-space.
Ideally there would be a way for user-space to discover the immediate/x0 values that the
kernel will not deliver via the catch-all. This could be done via some co-processor
register... thing...

I don't think we'd ever need a physical interrupt to be delivered via Qemu as an SDEI event.
The use-cases for this stuff mean it can be done 'higher-up'. For example, your timer is
probably used as a watchdog. On a real system this may well be a device with an interrupt,
but Qemu could happily emulate a watchdog using some other linux API. (e.g. SIGALRM).



Thanks,

James
