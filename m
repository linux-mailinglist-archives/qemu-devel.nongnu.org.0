This patch series is bunch of cleanups to the hmp monitor code.
It mostly moves the blockdev related hmp handlers to its own file,
and does some minor refactoring.

No functional changes expected.

Changes from V1:
   * move the handlers to block/monitor/block-hmp-cmds.c
   * tiny cleanup for the commit messages

Changes from V2:
   * Moved all the function prototypes to new header (blockdev-hmp-cmds.h)
   * Set the license of blockdev-hmp-cmds.c to GPLv2+
   * Moved hmp_snapshot_* functions to blockdev-hmp-cmds.c
   * Moved hmp_drive_add_node to blockdev-hmp-cmds.c
     (this change needed some new exports, thus in separate new patch)
   * Moved hmp_qemu_io and hmp_eject to blockdev-hmp-cmds.c
   * Added 'error:' prefix to vreport, and updated the iotests
     This is invasive change, but really feels like the right one
   * Added minor refactoring patch that drops an unused #include

Changes from V3:
   * Dropped the error prefix patches for now due to fact that it seems
     that libvirt doesn't need that after all. Oh well...
     I'll send them in a separate series.

   * Hopefully correctly merged the copyright info the new files
     Both files are GPLv2 now (due to code from hmp.h/hmp-cmds.c)

   * Addressed review feedback
   * Renamed the added header to block-hmp-cmds.h

   * Got rid of checkpatch.pl warnings in the moved code
     (cosmetic code changes only)

   * I kept the reviewed-by tags, since the changes I did are minor.
     I hope that this is right thing to do.

Changes from V4:
   * Rebase with recent changes
   * Fixed review feedback

Best regards,
