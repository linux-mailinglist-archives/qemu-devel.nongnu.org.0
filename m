Hi,

It=E2=80=99s my understanding that we want better test coverage for qcow2=
=E2=80=99s
external data files.  I think the natural thing to do is to let all
tests create images with external data files.

We already have the -o option for ./check for additional image options
(and I regularly use it for recount_bits=3D1 and compat=3D0.10).
Unfortunately, we cannot use it directly for data_file, because of
course every test image needs its own data file.  What I think we want
is a pattern: Something like -o 'data_file=3D$TEST_IMG.data_file', and
then =E2=80=9C$TEST_IMG=E2=80=9D is replaced by the qcow2 image name.

This is done by the final patch in this series.  There is a lot of
preparatory work to be done, though.

(1) Some tests overwrite IMGOPTS.  This will make them ignore
    user-specified options.  That was always a problem (that means those
    tests ignored my pleas for refcount_bits=3D1 and compat=3D0.10) but
    someone needs to fix this at some point, and I guess that=E2=80=99s m=
e right
    now.
    So we need to stop tests from overwriting IMGOPTS.  This is done by
    patches 1 through 9.

    In addition, patch 10 fixes other cases where user-specified options
    are ignored (because some tests use qemu-img create directly instead
    of _make_test_img).

(2) Some tests access image files directly.  This can only work for
    images without external data files.  There are two subcases:
    (A) rm: Fixed by patch 11
    (B) cp/mv: Fixed by patch 12

(3) Some tests are broken with data_file, but we can fix it.  Done by
    patches 13 through 16.

(4) Some tests are broken with data_file, and I don=E2=80=99t think we ca=
n fix
    it.  So patch 17 adds _unsupported_imgopts data_file for them.

(5) And then there=E2=80=99s patch 18, which does what we really want.


Future work:
- Python tests currently completely ignore IMGOPTS.  Preexisting
  problem, needs to be addressed in another series, but for the moment
  it at least means they won=E2=80=99t break if you run the tests with
  data_file.

- data_file_raw=3Don needs to be addressed in another series.  I suspect
  this will mainly consist of making it unsupported in all tests that
  use backing files.
