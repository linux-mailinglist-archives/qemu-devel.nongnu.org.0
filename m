Right, which is why I stated topology should not be inferred from
it.

I know, but how KVM assigns MPIDRs today is not really important
to KVM userspace. KVM userspace shouldn't depend on a KVM
algorithm, as it could change.

We can assign them to whatever we want, as long as they're
unique and as long as Aff0 is assigned per the GIC requirements,
e.g. GICv3 requires that Aff0 be from 0 to 0xf. Also, when
pinning VCPUs to PCPUs we should ensure that MPIDRs with matching
Aff3,Aff2,Aff1 fields should actually be peers with respect to
the GIC.

We shouldn't try to encode topology in the MPIDR in any way,
so we might as well simply increment a counter to assign them,
which could possibly be the same as the VCPU ID.
