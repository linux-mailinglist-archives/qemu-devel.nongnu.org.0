So this thread is a follow up on:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg546430.html

For Open Source software I can understand we want to be able to rebuild 
them, and should provide a link about how to rebuild.

I don't want to rebuild images myself, I want to focus on testing QEMU. 
I tried once to build a MIPSsim kernel and it was a total nightmare:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-04/msg04071.html
(Thomas Huth eventually succeeded using buildroot).

QEMU machines are not restricted to running Linux or other Open Source 
software. It seems important to be able to test for regressions with 
closed-source code too, because it usually has been well tested on real 
hardware.

I just posted a firmware test:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg651012.html

I could find it stored compressed and uuencoded on the Wayback Machine.
Since I don't want to abuse from this amazing service, and other script 
to decode/uncompress it, I stored it on a new repository with its SHA-1
(the default hash used by Avocado):
https://github.com/philmd/qemu-testing-blob/tree/master/hppa/hp9000/712

Is this acceptable? Incorrect?

Regarding Avocado tests, maybe we can simply add a "untrusted" or 
"closedsource" tag, so people willing to test untrusted binaries could 
still run the tests using 'avocado --tag untrusted_software', and we 
could skip these tests by default.

I am very interested because I already experimented with:

- AIX on PReP/40p
- some RTOS on Canon PowerShot A1100
- VxWorks on MIPS and SPARC
- closed-source bootloader for Raspi3/4

Regards,

Phil.
