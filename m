But, Eric, while, to some extent I understand your motivation and the idea,
there are still features working in in-tree builds only (some coccinele
scenarios, and some gcov-related scenarios - and perhaps others that nobody
seems to care to try to find out at all), and not in out-of tree builds.
And, now, if I understand well your proposal, and supposing that I use gcov
in-tree build (since I have to), this will stop me from doing out-of-tree
builds in this QEMU directory, since my in-tree gcov build will be
destroyed.

OK, I can use two separate directories as a workaround, but what bothers me
is that such proposal makes my workflow more complicated, driven by almost
obsesive desire to eradicate in-tree builds, instead on focusing on making
sure that out-of-build tree supports absolutely all and the same
functionality as in-tree builds, which is, I repeat, not the case right now=
.

Further, now speaking to Daniel, I don't have anything from the fact that
all CI tests are done with out-of-tree builds, if the feature I use works
only in in-tree builds. The whole message has some vieled disregarding tone
for people forced to use in-tree builds, and I see it as very close to
"pulling the rug under people" for such cases, and Peter said this should
not be happening.

Of course, many peaple are so wonderful when it comes to "exterminating"
in-tree builds, but when it comes to efforts to make sure everything works
in out-of-tree builds as in in-tree builds, suddenly everybody disappears,
don't have bandwith, don't care for something that doesn't affect them,
seem not to want to even think about such cases, etc.etc. Disappointing!

Sincerely,
Aleksandar

<p dir=3D"ltr">But, Eric, while, to some extent I understand your motivatio=
n and the idea, there are still features working in in-tree builds only (so=
me coccinele scenarios, and some gcov-related scenarios - and perhaps other=
s that nobody seems to care to try to find out at all), and not in out-of t=
ree builds. And, now, if I understand well your proposal, and supposing tha=
t I use gcov in-tree build (since I have to), this will stop me from doing =
out-of-tree builds in this QEMU directory, since my in-tree gcov build will=
 be destroyed.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">OK, I can use two separate directories as a workaround, but =
what bothers me is that such proposal makes my workflow more complicated, d=
riven by almost obsesive desire to eradicate in-tree builds, instead on foc=
using on making sure that out-of-build tree supports absolutely all and the=
 same functionality as in-tree builds, which is, I repeat, not the case rig=
ht now.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">Further, now speaking to Daniel, I don&#39;t have anything f=
rom the fact that all CI tests are done with out-of-tree builds, if the fea=
ture I use works only in in-tree builds. The whole message has some vieled =
disregarding tone for people forced to use in-tree builds, and I see it as =
very close to &quot;pulling the rug under people&quot; for such cases, and =
Peter said this should not be happening.</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">Of course, many peaple are so wonderful when it comes to &qu=
ot;exterminating&quot; in-tree builds, but when it comes to efforts to make=
 sure everything works in out-of-tree builds as in in-tree builds, suddenly=
 everybody disappears, don&#39;t have bandwith, don&#39;t care for somethin=
g that doesn&#39;t affect them, seem not to want to even think about such c=
ases, etc.etc. Disappointing!</p>
