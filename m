Hm, interesting. What is your exact fio configuration? Specifically,
which iodepth are you using? I guess with a low iodepth (and O_DIRECT),
the effect of draining the queue might not be as visible.

> - preallocation=off is still faster than preallocation=metadata.

Brian, can you help us here with some input?

Essentially what we're having here is a sparse image file on XFS that is
opened with O_DIRECT (presumably - Berto, is this right?), and Berto is
seeing cases where a random write benchmark is faster if we're doing the
64k ZERO_RANGE + 4k pwrite when touching a 64k cluster for the first
time compared to always just doing the 4k pwrite. This is with a 1 MB
extent size hint.

From the discussions we had the other day [1][2] I took away that your
suggestion is that we should not try to optimise things with
fallocate(), but just write the areas we really want to write and let
the filesystem deal with the sparse parts. Especially with the extent
size hint that we're now setting, I'm surprised to hear that doing a
ZERO_RANGE first still seems to improve the performance.

Do you have any idea why this is happening and what we should be doing
with this?

This makes some sense because then we're falling back to writing
explicit zero buffers (unless you disabled that, too).

Interesting, this means that the fallocate() call costs you basically no
time. I would have expected preallocation=falloc to be a little faster.

I guess this saves the conversion of unwritten extents to fully
allocated ones?

As the extent size hint doesn't seem to influence your test case anyway,
can I assume that ext4 behaves similar to XFS in all four cases?
