I don't disagree.  For icount in particular however we're about 12 years
too late.

If you want you can add to your accelerator ops series one for
qemu_get_clock_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL), cpu_get_ticks() and
qemu_start_warp_timer(), that would certainly work for me; those three
are the only non-TCG-specific functions that read use_icount, as far as
I can see.  qemu_start_warp_timer() does have an "if (qtest_enabled())"
even, so it's clearly fishy.

It may even be a good idea for TCG to have three sets of accelerator ops
for respectively multi-threaded, round-robin and icount.

My point is that this patch is not the right way to start the
refactoring because *for now* it's wrong to treat icount as a TCG-only
concept.  Having more separation between accelerators, as well as a
clear interface between core and accelerators is certainly a laudable
goal though.

If you can get rid of use_icount using a new accelerator ops member, it
would be even better. :)

Thanks.  But I don't think it's sweeping anything under the carpet; it's
great if we find a currently latent s390 bug, but it is orthogonal to
the design of that core<->accelerator interface.

(And by the way, my suggested patch to icount_enabled() was completely
wrong!).
