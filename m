The assumption from here was that this only appeared to be working due
to:

a) Deploy =3D netboot + reboot from disk =3D working

but at the same time

b) Start =3D netboot (fail) + no fallback =3D fail


To get that from Maas UI we stopped the guest (it went down as expected).
Then from Maas we said "power on" again.

There on (b) it failed as maas didn't provide it with an install image.
If you track it in the console you see:

$virsh start vm1 --console
setlocale: No such file or directory
Domain vm1 started

Maas tries a few times as we see the guest flip between "shut off" and "pau=
sed" state.
But then fives up.

The super-TL;DR matching the current insights is:
- deploy s390x Maas-KVM @ s390x worked and still does
- poweroff/poweron s390x Maas-KVM @ s390x never worked and still does not

To fix the latter we either need
a) upstream to implement a fallback to the next boot mechanism
b) maas to modify the XML after deploy to boot from disk

Title:
  [2.6] Unable to reboot s390x KVM machine after initial deploy

Status in MAAS:
  New
Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  MAAS version: 2.6.1 (7832-g17912cdc9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1)
  Arch: S390x

  Appears that MAAS can not find the s390x bootloader to boot from the
  disk, not sure how maas determines this.  However this was working in
  the past. I had originally thought that if the maas machine was
  deployed then it defaulted to boot from disk.

  If I force the VM to book from disk, the VM starts up as expected.

  Reproduce:

  - Deploy Disco on S390x KVM instance
  - Reboot it

  on the KVM console...
