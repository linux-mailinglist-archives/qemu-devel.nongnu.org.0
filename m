I screwed up the part of my argument that actually has a hope to be
valid, let me try again.

With qdev, you can always do frob->prop = 42, because properties are
always backed by a struct member.

With QOM, properties are built around visitor-based getters and setters.
This means you can always do (but never actually would do) something
like

    fortytwo = qnum_from_int(42);
    v = qobject_input_visitor_new(fortytwo);
    set_prop(OBJECT(frob), v, "prop", cookie, &err);
    visit_free(v);
    qobject_unref(fortytwo);

where set_prop() is the setter you passed to object_property_add(), and
@cookie is the opaque value you passed along with it.

*Maybe* set_prop() wraps around a simpler setter you can call directly,
or even a struct member you can set directy.  QOM does not care.

And that's my point: QOM does not care for the C layer.

qdev_device_add() is still stuck in the QemuOpts age.

It's a death trap:

/*
 * The string input visitor does not implement support for visiting
 * QAPI structs, alternates, null, or arbitrary QTypes. Only flat lists
 * of integers (except type "size") are supported.
 */

"Does not implement support for visiting" is polite language for
"crashes when you dare to visit".

True!
