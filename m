	I looked at this and think we could map VFIO commands over a
UNIX socket without a lot of difficulty.  We'd have to use SCM
messages to pass file descriptors from the QEMU process to the
emulation process for certain operations, but that shouldn't be
a big problem.  Here are the mission mode operations:

configuration

	VFIO defines a number of configuration ioctl()s that we could
turn into messages, but if we make the protocol specific to PCI, then
all of the information they transmit (e.g., device regions and
interrupts) can be discovered by parsing the device's PCI config
space.  A lot of the current VFIO code that parses config space could
be re-used to do this.

MMIO

	VFIO uses reads and writes on the VFIO file descriptor to
perform MMIOs to the device.  The read/write offset encodes the VFIO
region and offset of the MMIO. (the VFIO regions correspond to PCI
BARs) These would have to be changed to send messages that include the
VFIO region and offset (and data for writes) to the emulation process.

interrupts

	VFIO creates eventfds that are sent to the kernel driver so it
can inject interrupts into a guest.  We would have to send these
eventfds over the socket to the emulation process using SCM messages.
The emulation process could then trigger interrupts by writing on the
eventfd.

DMA

	This is one place where I might diverge from VFIO.  It uses an
ioctl to tell the kernel driver what areas of guest memory the device
can address.  The driver then pins that memory so it can be programmed
into a HW IOMMU.  We could avoid pinning of guest memory by adopting
the vhost-user idea of sending the file descriptors used by QEMU to
create guest memory to the emulation process, and having it mmap() the
guest itself.  IOMMUs are handled by having the emulation process
request device DMA to guest PA translations from QEMU.

       The emulation program API could be based on the current
libmuser API or the libvfio-user API.  The protocol itself wouldn=E2=80=99=

care which is chosen.  Our multi-processQEMU project would have to
change how devices are specified from the QEMU command line to the
emulation process command line.
