I took a quick look at the contents of those dockerfiles and while I
agree that it's the obvious place to start, I'm not sure I would say
that generating them using lcitool is going to be easy :)

Basically there seem to be a number of assumptions both in lcitool
and in the QEMU dockerfiles, and getting the two to agree on those
will require quite some work from what I can tell.

But again, I agree it's something that should be worked on.

Perhaps 'lcitool variables' could be of use here.
