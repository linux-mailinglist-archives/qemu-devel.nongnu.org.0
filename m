Some more info.

This evening I've tried some more things.

Qemu 5.2/Mac OS X Catalina (Qemu from home-brew)

Host OS - OpenBSD/i386
1. Booted with

2. Booted with
qemu-system-i386 -m 256M -hda openbsd-disk-i386.img -netdev user,id=3Dmynet=
0 -device virtio-net,netdev=3Dmynet0 =


With both ftp'ed ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.11/bind-9.16.11.tar.xz
Both were short and did not match the find at ISC.

See attached. SHA1 should be 1bfb5725c85fd9dffe868d8e826a1f8c0de509cc

Title:
  Short files returned via FTP on Qemu with various architectures and
  OSes

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  =

  Qemu 5.2 on Mac OS X Big Sur.

  I originally thought that it might be caused by the home-brew version of =
Qemu, but this evening I have removed the brew edition and compiled from sc=
ratch (using Ninja & Xcode compiler). =

  Still getting the same problem,.

  On the following architectures: =

  arm64, amd64 and sometimes i386 running NetBSD host OS; =

  i386 running OpenBSD host OS:

  I have seen a consistent problem with FTP returning short files. The
  file will be a couple of bytes too short. I do not believe this is a
  problem with the OS. Downloading the perl source code from CPAN does
  not work properly, nor does downloading bind from isc. I've tried this
  on different architectures as above.

  (Qemu 4.2 on Ubuntu/x86_64 with NetBSD/i386 seems to function fine. My
  gut feel is there is something not right on the Mac OS version of Qemu
  or a bug in 5.2 - obviously in the network layer somewhere. If you
  have anything you want me to try, please let me know - happy to help
  get a resolution.)
