Stick to imperative mood: Abort on error.

Do we need the sentence?  Doc comments of object_new(), qdev_new() and
i2c_slave_new() don't have it, they document *preconditions* instead,
using "must", and rely on the tacit understanding that a function may
abort or crash when its documented preconditions aren't met.  Matter of
taste, I guess.

Either consistently waste space for repeating the function name at the
beginning of its doc comment, or consistently don't :)

qdev_realize_and_unref()'s doc comment says "and drop a reference"
instead of "unref", because "unref" is not a word.

$ git-grep -h "@errp:" | sort -u
 *  @errp: pointer to Error*, to store an error if it happens
 * @errp:   error object
 * @errp: Error object
 * @errp: Error object which may be set by job_complete(); this is not
 * @errp: Error object.
 * @errp: If an error occurs, a pointer to an area to store the error
 * @errp: Output pointer for error information. Can be NULL.
 * @errp: Pointer for reporting an #Error.
 * @errp: Populated with an error in failure cases
 * @errp: a pointer to an Error that is filled if getting/setting fails.
 * @errp: a pointer to return the #Error object if an error occurs.
 * @errp: an error indicator
 * @errp: error
 * @errp: error object
 * @errp: error object handle
 * @errp: handle to an error object
 * @errp: if an error occurs, a pointer to an area to store the error
 * @errp: indirect pointer to Error to be set
 * @errp: location to store error
 * @errp: location to store error information
 * @errp: location to store error information.
 * @errp: location to store error, will be set only for exception
 * @errp: pointer to Error*, to store an error if it happens.
 * @errp: pointer to NULL initialized error object
 * @errp: pointer to a NULL initialized error object
 * @errp: pointer to a NULL-initialized error object
 * @errp: pointer to an error
 * @errp: pointer to error object
 * @errp: pointer to initialized error object
 * @errp: pointer to uninitialized error object

Aside: gotta love these two.

 * @errp: returns an error if this function fails
 * @errp: set *errp if the check failed, with reason
 * @errp: set in case of an error
 * @errp: set on error
 * @errp: unused
 * @errp: where to put errors

Plenty of choice, recommend not to invent another one :)

Recommend to use a separate paragraph for the return value.  Since your
comment style resembles GTK-Doc style[*], you may just as well use it
for the return value, like this:

      Returns: %true on success, %false on failure.

By convention, it goes after the function description.

The advice on use is more elaborate qdev_realize_and_unref()'s.  That
one simply shows intended use.  I doubt we need more.  But as the person
who wrote qdev_realize_and_unref(), I'm singularly unqualified judging
the need ;)

[*] A style I dislike, but it's common in QEMU, so you're certainly
entitled to use it.
