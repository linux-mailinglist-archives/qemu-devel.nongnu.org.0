The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  QEMU does not express a dependency on perl-Test-Harness

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  This is a minor thing; in Fedora you can install most of the developer
  dependencies by issuing something like `dnf builddep qemu-kvm` and
  this takes care of just about everything such that you can run
  ./configure and make.

  For "make check" though, configure doesn't catch that you'll need
  perl-Test-Harness; so it fails halfway through the check routine, and
  you'll see this:

  ```
  Can't locate TAP/Parser.pm in @INC (you may need to install the TAP::Pars=
er module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /u=
sr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /u=
sr/share/perl5) at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
  make: *** [/home/jhuston/src/qemu/tests/Makefile.include:905: check-unit]=
 Error 2
  ```

  I'm not sure how we should express this dependency; it shouldn't be a
  requirement for building, but it IS a dependency for testing. We
  probably ought not let users skip the qapi tests just because they
  don't have the perl requirement met.

  (And, separately, the Fedora package should list this as a builddep,
  but that's not an issue for here.)
