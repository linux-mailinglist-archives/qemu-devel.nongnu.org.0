"Not used commonly by the user" is a good argument for
"just use PCI" -- users who want the functionality can add
it to their QEMU command line or VM config, and the bulk of
users who don't don't have to worry about it.

PCI devices don't have to support hotplug; I agree you don't
need hotplug for this use case.

Using a PCI device would match up with the way the x86 pvpanic
device is an ISA bus device.

That's the kernel folks' problem to deal with, because they accepted
the kernel driver without having confirmed that QEMU was going to
implement it. If I were them I'd deprecate and delete that driver code.
(They should certainly fix the bit of the documentation that claims
that QEMU implements it.)
