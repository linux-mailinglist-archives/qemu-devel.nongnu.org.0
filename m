The idea behind possible_cpus is to allow users query topo information
board generates (based on -smp) at configuration time (or late) so users
could know what -numa cpu,topo_options [and -device foo-cpu,topo_options]
to use, initializing apic_id on the first access is secondary and I did
it only because I could do it without additional data.

But main purpose of possible_cpus is to keep topology information.
That includes numa node mapping, which should be stored in possible_cpus
along with the rest of cpu topology.

Looking [12/18] numa patch, it makes -numa node,cpus legacy option
to reintroduce data duplication, by storing mapping elsewhere and
then putting that mapping into possible_cpus at numa complete time
(that's what I dislike and don't see a valid reason to do so).

That also won't work if user queries hotpluggable-cpus before that time
and it also doesn't work if user uses preferable -numa cpu,topo_options
as both would initialize possible_cpus on the first access.

So if you need do some board specific post-processing done on topo
information when it's complete and recalculate apic_id do it at board
init time like was suggested before (x86_cpu_new() looks like a good
place to do it).
