I'm triaging old bugs: Can you provide command lines, versions, and
steps to test and measure the relative performance?

At the very least, please try to confirm on the latest version of QEMU
(5.2.0-rc0, if possible) to update this report.

Title:
  qemu system i386 poor performance on e5500 core

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I had been tested with generic core net building or with mtune e5500 but =
i have the same result: performances =

  are extremly low compared with other classes of powerpc cpu.
  The strange is the 5020 2ghz in all emulators been tested by me is compar=
able with a 970MP 2.7 ghz in speed and benchmarks but im facing the half of=
 performance in i386-soft-mmu compared with a 2.5 ghz 970MP.
