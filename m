The only other operating mode that's ever been mooted is softmmu-user
(and no implementation has been done so far). Even then I don't think
that is a distinction that should be reported to the plugin as we are
trying not to leak implementation details.

But yes the practical upshot is for system emulation you at least have
sort of bounded size for how many threads you may have running.

but what too? It would certainly be wrong because any user-space process
could create (and destroy) thousands of threads.

We could consider just asking plugins to deal with threads with their
own __thread variables but in that case we'd need to expose some sort of
thread exit/cleanup method so they can collect data from threads and
safely place it somewhere else - but I suspect that is a hairy
programming model to impose on plugins.

So far all the example plugins have just used locks to serialise things
and it's not been too bad. I guess we could do with an example that
tries to use this information to get an idea of how grungy the interface
is. Perhaps exposing the vCPUs at this point is pointless and we should
just stick to TARGET_NAME for now?
