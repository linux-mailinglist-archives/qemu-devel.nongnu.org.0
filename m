Yes, QAPI type 'int' is int64_t.  All of QAPI's integer types map to
exact-width C integer types.

If we had many places where we could forget to handle the
interoperability capability, I'd shoot down the idea of having it :)

Fortunately, we don't: the qobject visitors take care of it, and they
come with unit tests.

I listed the few exceptions above under "Let's talk implementation for a
bit."

* query-qmp-schema

  No input.

  Output contains no numbers.  Should it acquire numbers, we'll probably
  want to get rid of the hack, so the output goes through the visitor.

* netdev_add

  Input gets stringified anyway (misfeature).

  No output.

* device_add

  Input gets stringified anyway (misfeature).

  No output.
