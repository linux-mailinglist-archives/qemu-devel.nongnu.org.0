Yes, that's a known risk. SPICE lets you disable clipboard synchronization
in QEMU, and any client app should also support doing the same. Basically
only want clipboard sync if you're using a trustworthy guest. eg where
both host and guest admin are the same person, and even then you might
not want it sometimes.
