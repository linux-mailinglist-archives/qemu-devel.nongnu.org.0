The first step would be making the block drivers full replacements of
the old things, which unfortunately isn't true today.

After your "deal with filters" series, we should be a lot closer for the
core infrastructure at least.

Not sure about copy-on-read, but I know that throttle still doesn't have
feature parity with -drive throttling. At least I'm pretty sure that
something about changing the group or group options at runtime (and not
just dropping the x-) was missing.

Maybe the backup job wasn't that clever after all. At least if you care
about keeping the point-in-time snapshot at the start of the backup job
instead of just retrying and getting a snapshot of a different point in
time that is just as good.

If you do care about the specific point in time, the safe way to do it
is to take a snapshot and copy that away, and then delete the snapshot
again.

The only problem is that merging external snapshots is slow and you end
up writing the new data twice. If only we had a COW image format... :-)
