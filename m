Yeah, we definitely could do with improving things here, it is annoying
to have to write code for handling some of the oddball cases when you
have just one register that allows byte accesses or whatever.
The thing I have in the back of my mind as a concern is that we have
had several "is this a buffer overrun" questions where the answer has
been "it can't be, because the core code doesn't allow a call to the
read/write function for a 4 byte access where the address is not 4-aligned,
so my_byte_array[addr] is always in-bounds".
So if we change the core code we need to make sure we don't
inadvertently remove a restriction that was protecting us from a guest
escape...
