In 21/73.  I'll read it as soon as I can.

File contents is about *TCG* plugins, file name advertises plugins
without a qualifier.  We can rename when it bothers us.

Good move.

I think there are multiple ways to avoid the nuclear outcome.

Coming to a conclusion before the soft freeze is the nicest one.

Making an exception for late merging is another one, but Peter may
prefer not to.

Yet another one is merging the pull request before the soft freeze with
the understanding that it'll be reverted unless we come to a positive
conclusion before say -rc0 (Nov 5).  I'm confident we can work it out in
Lyon.
