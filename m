The Windows jobs are terribly slow, yes, and we've discussed that a couple 
of times before with no satisfying solution, e.g.:

 
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/e80726cc-633d-435c-7a2a-5cae43624282@redhat.com/

... so we currently settled on not running the qtests in the 64-bit job 
since that would take too long.

I also don't have a real good idea how to improve the situation ... we could 
switch to even simpler targets (e.g. s390x-softmmu should compile faster and 
run less tests than ppc64-softmmu, I think), or would it be still OK to bump 
the timeout to 80 minutes here? (90 minutes, like it has been discussed last 
year is already very borderline, but I think 80 minutes might still be OK, 
especially since those jobs don't wait for another job from the container 
stage?)

> We can add --disable-tools to the slower.

For the 32-bit job, this would further decrease the test scope ... should be 
OK as a last resort, I guess.

I think those Windows jobs are still quite a bit special ... e.g. until some 
months ago, the "timeout" setting was also not working at all IIRC.
