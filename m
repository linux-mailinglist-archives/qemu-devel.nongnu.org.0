Definitely emulate - I already have C code that can track which memory
addresses have been loaded into the cache (though not the actual data).
The idea for using QEMU for this project came from a research paper I read
awhile ago, but they were using version 0.12:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945730
I started trying to create this with helper functions, but when I heard
about the plugins, that sounded like a cleaner way to go.
The end goal is being able to use QEMU as a fault injection platform, to
test the effects of Single-bit upsets on baremetal C code.  So I would like
some way to interact with the plugin as QEMU is running; I have some ideas
on how to do this, but none fleshed out yet.
I actually saw this morning on qemu-discuss that someone was asking if
something like Valgrind could be created using the TCG plugins, so there is
certainly interest in this kind of thing.

The way you explained this, although it might seem simple, really helped me
understand better the level at which the TCG plugins operate.
I went and changed my code to be more based on the code in hotpages.c, and
it is much simpler now.
I'm going to go look at that Dinero Cache Simulator you linked to see if I
can get any ideas on how to improve my cache code.

I'm not familiar with cache management instructions.  What exactly do you
mean by that?  It sounds like something that would be dependent on the
guest architecture.
Or maybe it's things like pre-fetching hints?  Then the plugin would need
to take into account cache latencies, something my code doesn't deal with
right now.

I would be glad to share my implementation once it's in a better working
state.
Where can I find guidelines on the coding standard expected of QEMU
software?
Thanks

&gt;&gt; Some approaches we could take include:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- hook into tcg_global_*_new and allow plugin to intro=
spect registers<br>
&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- hook into gdbstub in some way<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The first approach elides over the fact that a lot of registers ar=
en&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt; actually known to the TCG - pretty much all vector registers tend =
to be<br>
&gt;&gt; loaded into anonymous TCG temps as we go. Maybe this could just be=
 fixed<br>
&gt;&gt; by just providing a few more registrations functions at the start =
even<br>
&gt;&gt; if the TCG itself wouldn&#39;t use that knowledge.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The gdbstub provides a lot more visibility of register state and f=
or<br>
&gt;&gt; some architectures this can be quite comprehensive - for example i=
n<br>
&gt;&gt; system mode you can access pretty much every ARM co-processor regi=
ster.<br>
&gt;&gt; However the gdb interface is a little clunky as there are a lot of=
 magic<br>
&gt;&gt; register id numbers and the canonical way to enumerate this is to =
chew<br>
&gt;&gt; through a bunch of XML that each target generates (see<br>
&gt;&gt; gdb_register_coprocessor). I&#39;m not keen on exposing that pile =
of XML via<br>
&gt;&gt; the register interface. Maybe there is scope to improve our intern=
al<br>
&gt;&gt; APIs so the enumeration of registers can be handled by helpers tha=
t<br>
&gt;&gt; record mappings and ids and generate the XML for the gdbstub centr=
ally?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; There may be other approaches we could take and I&#39;m open to su=
ggestions.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;d be happy to look into ways to implement this functionality.=C2=
=A0 However, I<br>
&gt; just started using Qemu this year, so these things sound like they wou=
ld<br>
&gt; have a steep learning curve for me.<br>
&gt; The gdbstub approach seems like it would provide the most introspectio=
n<br>
&gt; ability.=C2=A0 What would you suggest as a starting point for looking =
into this?<br>
&gt; All of this being said, if you think my project is too complicated, to=
<br>
&gt; implement a cache emulator with TCG plugins, then I could always try j=
ust<br>
&gt; hacking together some custom helper functions.<br>
<br>
As I said above I don&#39;t think you need register values to do cache<br>
emulation as you have the addresses. You will need to decode some of the<br=
>
cache management instructions though. Fortunately you can do that at<br>
translation time and only instrument the ones you need. See howvec for<br>
examples.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not familiar with cac=
