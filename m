+/*
+ * ARMCPRegInfo type field bits. If the SPECIAL bit is set this is a
+ * special-behaviour cp reg and bits [11..8] indicate what behaviour
+ * it has. Otherwise it is a simple cp reg, where CONST indicates that
+ * TCG can assume the value to be constant (ie load at translate time)
+ * and 64BIT indicates a 64 bit wide coprocessor register. SUPPRESS_TB_END
+ * indicates that the TB should not be ended after a write to this register
+ * (the default is that the TB ends after cp writes). OVERRIDE permits
+ * a register definition to override a previous definition for the
+ * same (cp, is64, crn, crm, opc1, opc2) tuple: either the new or the
+ * old must have the OVERRIDE bit set.
+ * ALIAS indicates that this register is an alias view of some underlying
+ * state which is also visible via another register, and that the other
+ * register is handling migration and reset; registers marked ALIAS will not be
+ * migrated but may have their state set by syncing of register state from KVM.
+ * NO_RAW indicates that this register has no underlying state and does not
+ * support raw access for state saving/loading; it will not be used for either
+ * migration or KVM state synchronization. (Typically this is for "registers"
+ * which are actually used as instructions for cache maintenance and so on.)
+ * IO indicates that this register does I/O and therefore its accesses
+ * need to be marked with gen_io_start() and also end the TB. In particular,
+ * registers which implement clocks or timers require this.
+ * RAISES_EXC is for when the read or write hook might raise an exception;
+ * the generated code will synchronize the CPU state before calling the hook
+ * so that it is safe for the hook to call raise_exception().
+ * NEWEL is for writes to registers that might change the exception
+ * level - typically on older ARM chips. For those cases we need to
+ * re-read the new el when recomputing the translation flags.

- * ALIAS indicates that this register is an alias view of some underlying

- * register is handling migration and reset; registers marked ALIAS will not be
- * migrated but may have their state set by syncing of register state from KVM.
- * NO_RAW indicates that this register has no underlying state and does not
- * support raw access for state saving/loading; it will not be used for either
- * migration or KVM state synchronization. (Typically this is for "registers"
- * which are actually used as instructions for cache maintenance and so on.)
- * IO indicates that this register does I/O and therefore its accesses
- * need to be marked with gen_io_start() and also end the TB. In particular,
- * registers which implement clocks or timers require this.
- * RAISES_EXC is for when the read or write hook might raise an exception;
- * the generated code will synchronize the CPU state before calling the hook
- * so that it is safe for the hook to call raise_exception().
- * NEWEL is for writes to registers that might change the exception
- * level - typically on older ARM chips. For those cases we need to
