So probably it's time to work on a "virt" machine. What style would you pre=
fer?
PC-like or SoC style?

In fact we've got two pseudo board (mips, mipssim) for MIPS,
but non of them seems modern enough.

I can launch a Loongson-3 style board after dealing with Kernel code clean-=
up.

Yeah. That's the truth.

mipsel (MIPS 32-bit Little Endian) is still alive. I believe Debian won't g=
ive up it as long as i386
still exist.
