So, with this tree I'm no longer getting problems if openssl-devel is
not installed, so that much looks good.

I am getting some different errors - I was seeing this before (with
openssl-devel installed) sometimes, but only sometimes.  I haven't yet
worked out a pattern for when they appeared.  They also don't appear
to be fatal, the rest of the tests seem to be running ok.  Any ideas?
