You proabably also need make distclean before going to use build dir.=20
Since in-tree build continues to work as before and hopefully even after=20
it won't some convenience functions will take care of it without the user=
=20
having to do it by hand I wonder if such a long warning is really needed=20
in configure now. Other than uselessly annoying users, what does this=20
patch achieve? The recommended way to build may change again when build=20
system is replaced and I won't change my usual way until it works and=20
going to just ignore this warning and I guess others who like in-tree=20
builds will do the same. But I've already said that so probably won't=20
mention it again.
