I understand that seeing the discussions going on and the patches
taking too long to be included might be frustrating.

These discussions shouldn't get into the way of addressing other
problems.  We don't need to wait until all discussions have
finished before proposing new patches or before merging patches
that are considered good.

About subdirectories, specifically, note that I explicitly said
it was a good idea.  If somebody wants to send patches, they are
welcome.

If I'm doing something else that could be blocking people from
getting work done, I'd like to fix that.  I'm aware that
sometimes I take too long to review patches, but I hope other
developers can help us on the review work.
