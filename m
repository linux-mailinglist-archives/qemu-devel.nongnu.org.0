This sounds almost like two other bugs we got fixed recently (in the
QEMU file-posix driver and in the XFS kernel driver) where two write
extending the file size were in flight in parallel, but if the shorter
one completed last, instead extending the file, it would end up
truncating it.

I'm not sure, though, why 8701 would try to change the file size because
it's entirely inside the already allocated file range. But maybe adding
the current file size at the start and completion of each request to
your debug output could give us more data points?
