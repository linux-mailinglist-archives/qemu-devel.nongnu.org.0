I guess the original message is trying to figure out what role that list
of people will play. If we go with your option and just add qemu-devel
to the list, then we wouldn't need to worry about adding anyone else to
the list. 
Otherwise, we will need to figure that out - I don't think anyone
currently on that list signed up to triage a bunch of fuzzing bugs :)

As a side note, the general fuzzers were just merged.

oss-fuzz should start using them for fuzzing sometime tommorrow.
