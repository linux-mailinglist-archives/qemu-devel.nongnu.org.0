If QEMU is hosting binaries, where any part contains GPL code, then we
need to be providing the full and corresponding source and the build
scripts needed to re-create the binary. Once we have such scripts it
should be trivial to trigger that from a CI job. If it isn't then
we're doing something wrong.  The CI quota is not an issue, because
this is not a job that we need to run continuously. It can be triggered
manually as & when we decide we need to refresh the binary, so would
be a small one-off CI quota hit.

Also note that gitlab is intending to start enforcing storage quota
on projects in the not too distant future. This makes it unappealing
to store binaries in git repos, unless we genuinely need the ability
to access historical versions of the binary. I don't believe we need
that for biosbits.

The binary can be published as a CI artifact and accessed directly
from the latest artifact download link. This ensures we only consume
quota for the most recently published binary artifact. So I don't see
a compelling reason to upload binaries into git.

With regards,
Daniel
