The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Xfer:features:read truncating xml sent to gdb frontends

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Around line 1326 in gdbstub.c:

              if (len > (MAX_PACKET_LENGTH - 5) / 2)
                  len =3D (MAX_PACKET_LENGTH - 5) / 2;

  is truncating processor reg description xml files longer than 2045
  bytes.  Deleting these lines works for my immediate need, but they
  seem to be trying to fix some buffer overrun condition so I won't
  offer a patch until we understand their purpose.
