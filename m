If it could actually track changes then I'd agree we shouldn't impose
any policy; but if it's just marking the whole area as dirty we're going
to need a bodge somewhere; this bodge doesn't look any worse than the
others to me.

Yes, agreed.

Without a way to prioritise the unpinned memory during that period,
we're going to be repeatedly sending the pinned memory which is going to
lead to a much larger bandwidth usage that required; so that's going in
completely the wrong direction and also wrong from the point of view of
the user.
