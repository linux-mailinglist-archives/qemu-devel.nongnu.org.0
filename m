I think we need to talk about how nvme patches are supposed to get
merged. I'm not familiar with the hardware nor the code, so the model
was that I just blindly merge patches that Keith has reviewed/acked,
just to spare him the work to prepare a pull request. But obviously, we
started doing things this way when there was a lot less activity around
the nvme emulation.

If we find that this doesn't scale any more, maybe we need to change
something. Depending on how much time Keith can spend on review in the
near future and how much control he wants to keep over the development,
I could imagine adding Klaus to MAINTAINERS, either as a co-maintainer
or as a reviewer. Then I could rely on reviews/acks from either of you
for merging series.

Of course, the patches don't necessarily have to go through my tree
either if this only serves to complicate things these days. If sending
separate pull requests directly to Peter would make things easier, I
certainly wouldn't object.
