According to the original commit (235fe3bfd46b1104575b540d0bc), it seems
like these were using for manual testing. If in all those years nobody
ever tried to integrate them into our "make check" test suite, I guess
they are just dead code.

I'd suggest to remove the "test tools" from commit 235fe3bfd46b1104575b5
since apparently nobody ever cared to integrate them into the test suite.

For the other scripts that are still used occasionally, I'd leave them
in their current location. If you don't want to maintain them, remove
them from your section in MAINTAINERS and add a new "QMP scripts"
section where you can mark the scripts/qmp folder as orphan.
