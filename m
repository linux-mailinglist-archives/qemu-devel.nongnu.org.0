Since I posted this bug report, I have done a little more research and
this specific part of this command is actually quite obsolete.  It use
to be documented (MMC v1.2 Draft), but later versions have actually
removed this part of the command, even stating "obsolete" in some of the
documentation.

If you want to still allow it, it actually does state 0x70 is an empty
drive.  However, being it is so obsolete, you may wish to change this
status to closed.

Thanks for asking.  I don't mind if you close this bug report.

Ben
