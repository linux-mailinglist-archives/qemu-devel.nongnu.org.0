Nope, I get the same even adding exec. I think it now also prints 
registers for already translated instructions where in_asm produces no 
ouput whereas before it was only dumping state when in_asm also had ouput. 
So now we get a lot more cpu state but we don't really know what they are 
for. Not sure what's the use of that, the previous output looked more 
useful.
