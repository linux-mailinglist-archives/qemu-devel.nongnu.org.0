After feature negotiation is complete? That feels like a regression in
behaviour: You would be able to add a device that may not be usable
(and you'll only find out after the guest tried to use it), instead of
making sure that only a non-transitional device can be added to start
with.

(We do not validate if the guest did not negotiate VERSION_1, but we
can certainly add a special case for the "guest did not accept offered
VERSION_1" case.)

That would be the best, but how do we get around the "transport does
not know the device type until it is too late" problem? Unless you want
to redo the internal interfaces.

Or keep it as-is, and disallow legacy for the individual device types,
with the validate check as a safety net during development.
