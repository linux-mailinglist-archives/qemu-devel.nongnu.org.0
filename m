    Crackling and clipping are two different things. Crackling is
    normally a timing problem where audio samples aren't delivered in
    time. Clipping produces harmonic distortions. For example a clipped
    sine wave will sound metallic because of the harmonic distortions.
    The difference between a clipped and a pure sine wave is clearly
    audible.<br>
