And specificially on the glib version question, we currently mandate 2.40.

If you try to use a glib API from a version newer than 2.40 we have things
setup so that you should get a fatal compile error due to our use of

   #define GLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED GLIB_VERSION_2_40


If you do think it is useful to have an API from glib > 2.40 you can put
some back compat logic in include/glib-compat.h so that you can use the
newer API and gracefully degrade on older glib.

Daniel
