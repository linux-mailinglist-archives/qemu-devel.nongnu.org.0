In general changed build pre-requisites such as new minimum software
versions are documented in the release notes:

   https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/5.0#Build_Information

We normally would not list build pre-requisites in the deprecation notes
at all, since they don't follow the deprecation process normally. We
just update minimum versions immediately that our supported OS build
platforms change due to an OS going end of life. So for example we
have in the past bumped gnutls, glib, nettle, gcc, etc min versions
with no warning.  So the fact that Python 2 was mentioned in the
deprecations at all was slightly unusual. This is mostly just to be
nice to users since the OS platforms here aren't going EOL and still
ship Python 2, we simply don't wish to support it any more, since
the distros also all have Py 3.

Yeah, I've said in the past that we should not be deleting deprecations
from the docs entirely.

If you look at GTK docs for example, you'll see they keep a record of
all incompatible or noteworth changes between release:

  https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-migrating-3-x-to-y.html

IMHO, we should follow this and have an appendix of removed features,
with sub-sections per QEMU release listing each removed feature. Thus
deprecation docs just get moved to this appendix at the right time.

Daniel
