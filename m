No, tieing this to machine types is not viable either. That is still
going to break essentially every single management application that
exists today using QEMU.

Breaking stuff existing apps is not acceptable for something that is
merely reporting sub-optimal performance. That's simply a documentation
task to highlight best practice to app developers.
