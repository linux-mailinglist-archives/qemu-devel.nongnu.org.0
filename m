Oops, I hadn't noticed that we were switching on reg.
Yeah, you might as well leave it as is. (We could have
a separate helper for each of TID0 and TID3 but that
seems like overkill.)

Arm conditional instructions are handled at a pretty
high level in the decode, because they all work the same way.
In disas_arm_insn() we have:

    if (cond != 0xe) {
        /* if not always execute, we generate a conditional jump to
           next instruction */
        arm_skip_unless(s, cond);
    }

and there's something similar in thumb_tr_translate_insn()
which puts in a branch based on the thumb condexec bits.
The target of the branch is a label whose position is
set either in arm_post_translate_insn() after the code for the
insn is emitted, or in arm_tr_tb_stop() if the insn is
the last in the TB (always true for branch or trap insns).
