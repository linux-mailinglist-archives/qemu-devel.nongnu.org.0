Yes that's it. In that case vfio_generic_window_address_quirk ops get
called when attempting to access this overlapping region.

When a physical level sensitive IRQ hits it is signaled through an
eventfd. The eventfd can be handled by QEMU. In this case,
vfio_intx_interrupt gets called, for PCI. It turns the mmap off (slow
path on) and injects the corresponding virtual IRQ into the guest. The
reason why we turn the mmap off is we need to trap the guest end of
interrupt to eventually deactivate the IRQ at physical level and unmask
it (it was auto-masked by the vfio driver). The first access into the
region is assumed to correspond to the servicing of the pending
interrupt by the guest handler (pending status clear) and at this point
we deactivate the physical IRQ. So .vfio_eoi gets called on the first
read/write BAR access after an INTx gets pending. Note the mmapping
(fast path) is not immediatly turned on after deactivating the physical
INTx. See comment before vfio_intx_mmap_enable.

When an irqfd/resamplefd is used we do not need that trick as the guest
EOI is trapped at KVM level through the virtual interrupt controller.
when the guest EOI is trapped KVM deactivates the associated physical
IRQ and notifies the userspace through the resamplefd for this latter to
unmask the physical IRQ.

Hope this helps.

Thanks

Eric
