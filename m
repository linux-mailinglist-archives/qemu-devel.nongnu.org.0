So it=E2=80=99s O(n/2) for each lookup on average, which is O(n). O:-)

I definitely don=E2=80=99t disagree about renaming, and if you think that
consolidating the functions is worth it, then it probably makes sense
(because you have the experience there, given this series).

But I=E2=80=99d still like to throw in that a rename is a more easily doabl=
e and
reviewable change than a consolidation, even if you get the same number
of hunks in the end.

I hope we can put off thinking about it if the known-zeroes check can
simply be put into make_zero(). O:-)

The same applies to reads-all-zeroes, though.  Only if both server and
client provide/understand this flag will it do something.
