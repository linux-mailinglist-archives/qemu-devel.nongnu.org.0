At what cost though ?   With this timeout, QEMU is going to start
reporting bogus failures for various QMP commands when running
under high load, even if those commands would actually run
successfully.  This will turn into an error report from libvirt
which will in turn probably cause an error in the mgmt application
using libvirt, and in turn could break the user's automation.
