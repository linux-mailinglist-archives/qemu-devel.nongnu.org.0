+=09 *
+=09 *  - When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel may send
+=09 *    read requests even for files opened with O_WRONLY. The
+=09 *    filesystem should be prepared to handle this.

+=09 *  - When writeback caching is disabled, the filesystem is

+=09 *    come through the kernel this will not work reliably. The
+=09 *    filesystem should thus either ignore the O_APPEND flag
+=09 *    (and let the kernel handle it), or return an error
+=09 *    (indicating that reliably O_APPEND is not available).
+=09 *
+=09 * Filesystem may store an arbitrary file handle (pointer,
+=09 * index, etc) in fi->fh, and use this in other all other file
+=09 * operations (read, write, flush, release, fsync).
+=09 *
+=09 * Filesystem may also implement stateless file I/O and not store
+=09 * anything in fi->fh.
+=09 *
+=09 * There are also some flags (direct_io, keep_cache) which the
+=09 * filesystem may set in fi, to change the way the file is opened.

+ *
+ * More than one such match may occur, in which case the action for
+ * each match is executed.
+ *
+ * There are three possible actions in case of a match:
+ *
+ * i) An integer (int or unsigned) variable determined by 'offset' is
+ *    set to 'value'
+ *
+ * ii) The processing function is called, with 'value' as the key
+ *
+ * iii) An integer (any) or string (char *) variable determined by
+ *    'offset' is set to the value of an option parameter
+ *
+ * 'offset' should normally be either set to
+ *
+ *  - 'offsetof(struct foo, member)'  actions i) and iii)
+ *
+ *  - -1=09=09=09      action ii)
+ *
+ * The 'offsetof()' macro is defined in the <stddef.h> header.
+ *
+ * The template determines which options match, and also have an
+ * effect on the action.  Normally the action is either i) or ii), but
+ * if a format is present in the template, then action iii) is
+ * performed.
+ *
+ * The types of templates are:
+ *
+ * 1) "-x", "-foo", "--foo", "--foo-bar", etc.=09These match only
+ *   themselves.  Invalid values are "--" and anything beginning
+ *   with "-o"
+ *
+ * 2) "foo", "foo-bar", etc.  These match "-ofoo", "-ofoo-bar" or
+ *    the relevant option in a comma separated option list
+ *
+ * 3) "bar=3D", "--foo=3D", etc.  These are variations of 1) and 2)
+ *    which have a parameter
+ *
+ * 4) "bar=3D%s", "--foo=3D%lu", etc.  Same matching as above but perform
+ *    action iii).
+ *
+ * 5) "-x ", etc.  Matches either "-xparam" or "-x param" as
+ *    two separate arguments
+ *
+ * 6) "-x %s", etc.  Combination of 4) and 5)
+ *
+ * If the format is "%s", memory is allocated for the string unlike with
+ * scanf().  The previous value (if non-NULL) stored at the this location =
