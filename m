I don't think using vhost-user with vDPA changes that. The VMM still
needs to emulate a virtio-pci/ccw/mmio device that the guest interfaces
with. If the device backend goes offline it's possible to restore that
state upon reconnection. What have I missed?

Regarding reconnection in general, it currently seems like a partially
solved problem in vhost-user. There is the "Inflight I/O tracking"
mechanism in the spec and some wording about reconnecting the socket,
but in practice I wouldn't expect all device types, VMMs, or device
backends to actually support reconnection. This is an area where a
uniform solution would be very welcome too.

There was discussion about recovering state in muser. The original idea
was for the muser kernel module to host state that persists across
device backend restart. That way the device backend can go away
temporarily and resume without guest intervention.

Then when the vfio-user discussion started the idea morphed into simply
keeping a tmpfs file for each device instance (no special muser.ko
support needed anymore). This allows the device backend to resume
without losing state. In practice a programming framework is needed to
make this easy and safe to use but it boils down to a tmpfs mmap.

Right, with vhost-user only the virtqueue processing is done in the
device backend. The VMM still has to do the virtio transport emulation
(pci, ccw, mmio) and vhost-user connection lifecycle, which is complex.

Going back to Marc-Andr=E9's point, why don't we focus on vfio-user so the
entire device can be moved out of the VMM?
