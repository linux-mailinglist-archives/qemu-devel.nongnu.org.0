One reason to NOT do this is that if the bug does wind up being 
legitimate -- perhaps it is still a top google hit for searching a 
particular error string -- once we have migrated, there will be no 
recourse for the hapless googler.

We can leave a generic forwarder to the new tracker once we migrate, but 
there's no way to "re-open" the issue. If someone re-files on the new 
tracker, they won't be able to update the bug to leave a new breadcrumb.

However, if we migrate the bug first, we can leave breadcrumbs on the 
old tracker pointing to the new one, and then if the bug winds up being 
legitimate, googlers can follow the breadcrumb to the gitlab issue and 
either update that bug, reopen it, etc.

So I might actually, though it seems strange, recommend migrating all of 
these bugs but labeling any that are over that 2 year mark with "stale", 
then closing them on the new system.

I might recommend a similar thing here: migrate-then-close.



P.S.: I am playing around with the Launchpad API right now. I think what 
I can see as a "non-contributor" is enough for us to migrate, but just 
in case, can I receive elevated privileges?
