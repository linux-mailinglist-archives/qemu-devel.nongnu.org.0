This doesn't directly affect Qemu, this is skiboot bug where it
creates device tree node for sensor-groups and does sensor
sanity check to initialize, but in negative scenario where there
is no sensors like in Qemu the sanity check fails but still device
tree populates the sensor-groups node wrongly. The cleanup is not
handled in skiboot and this patch does that.

I did a miss here, in skiboot there is check whether parsed pstate id
for pmin and pmax is valid or not. In this check, pmax to pmin for P8
it is 0 to -N and for P9 0 to N. But in Qemu for the MemoryRegionOps
structure read() callback function can have only uint64_t as return
type, so for P8 I got error from skiboot as we return postive value
and misunderstood to make this skiboot change. Cedric how can we handle
this from Qemu ?

Thanks for review,
