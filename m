I did it in v2.

I don't think this specific bug would be detected with a static
checker.  "die-id is mandatory" is not something that can be
extracted by looking at QOM data structures.  The new rule was
being enforced by the hotplug handler callbacks, and the hotplug
handler call tree is a bit complex (too complex for my taste, but
I digress).

We could have detected this with a simple CPU hotplug automated
test case, though.  Or with a very simple -device test case like
the one I have submitted with this patch.

This was detected by libvirt automated test cases.  It would be
nice if this was run during the -rc stage and not only after the
4.1.0 release, though.

I don't know details of the test job.  Danilo, Mirek, Yash: do
you know how this bug was detected, and what we could do to run
the same test jobs in upstream QEMU release candidates?
