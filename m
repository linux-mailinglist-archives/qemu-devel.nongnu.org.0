The virtio-rng driver waits until it receives enough entropy from the=20
RNG backend while a mutex is taken.

If the EGD daemon doesn't provide enough data to the RNG backend,=20
virtio-rng driver can hang.

It's easy to have if we start EGD backend with a socket in server,nowait=20
mode and no EGD daemon connects to the port.

Thanks,
Laurent
