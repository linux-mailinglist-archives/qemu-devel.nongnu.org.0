I think we could still do that.

As an example the WDC Swerv EL2 core
(https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-SweRV-EL2/blob/master/docs/RISC-V_SweRV_EL2_PRM.pdf)
has a custom power management CSR called mpmc. The code below is
completely untested (it won't compile), but wouldn't something like
this do what you want?

We can also add instructions in their own file. The higher level
decode tree will select these if required as Richard mentioned.

We do have to be careful with names, but I think we can just prefix
functions with the CPU name and we should be ok.

I don't see why it should be that bad.

We can then check to see if any custom CSR table or instruction
decoder exists. If there isn't we just wasted a few instructions to
perform the check, but if there is we can then run the custom logic.

RISC-V also has 4, but we shouldn't be adding any new ones.

It will be for guest accesses.

Things become tricky when you have knock on effects though, where a
custom CSR can affect the standard running of the machine. In that
case maybe we can override the generic instruction or set some state
in the CPU to have the desired outcome.
