This is implementing the host side of the net_failover concept
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/net_failover.html)

Changes since v5:
* rename net_failover_pair_id parameter/property to failover_pair_id
* in PCI code use pci_bus_is_express(). This won't fail on functions > 0
* make sure primary and standby can't be added to same PCI slot
* add documentation file in docs/ to virtio-net patch, add file to
   MAINTAINERS (added to networking devices section)
* add comment to QAPI event for failover negotiation, try to improve
   commit message=20

The general idea is that we have a pair of devices, a vfio-pci and a
virtio-net device. Before migration the vfio device is unplugged and data
flows to the virtio-net device, on the target side another vfio-pci device
is plugged in to take over the data-path. In the guest the net_failover
module will pair net devices with the same MAC address.

* Patch 1 adds the infrastructure to hide the device for the qbus and qdev =
APIs

* Patch 2 adds checks to PCIDevice for only allowing ethernet devices as
  failover primary and only PCIExpress capable devices

* Patch 3 sets a new flag for PCIDevice 'partially_hotplugged' which we
  use to skip the unrealize code path when doing a unplug of the primary
  device

* Patch 4 sets the pending_deleted_event before triggering the guest
  unplug request

* Patch 5 and 6 add new qmp events, one sends the device id of a device
  that was just requested to be unplugged from the guest and another one
  to let libvirt know if VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY was negotiated

* Patch 7 make sure that we can unplug the vfio-device before
  migration starts

* Patch 8 adds a new migration state that is entered while we wait for
  devices to be unplugged by guest OS

* Patch 9 just adds the new migration state to a check in libqos code

* Patch 10 In the second patch the virtio-net uses the API to defer adding =
the vfio
  device until the VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY feature is acked. It also
  implements the migration handler to unplug the device from the guest and
  re-plug in case of migration failure

* Patch 11 allows migration for failover vfio-pci devices

To summarize concerns/feedback from previous discussion:
1.- guest OS can reject or worse _delay_ unplug by any amount of time.
  Migration might get stuck for unpredictable time with unclear reason.
  This approach combines two tricky things, hot/unplug and migration.
  -> We need to let libvirt know what's happening. Add new qmp events
     and a new migration state. When a primary device is (partially)
     unplugged (only from guest) we send a qmp event with the device id. Wh=
en
     it is unplugged from the guest the DEVICE_DELETED event is sent.
     Migration will enter the wait-unplug state while waiting for the guest
     os to unplug all primary devices and then move on with migration.
2. PCI devices are a precious ressource. The primary device should never
  be added to QEMU if it won't be used by guest instead of hiding it in
  QEMU.
  -> We only hotplug the device when the standby feature bit was
     negotiated. We save the device cmdline options until we need it for
     qdev_device_add()
     Hiding a device can be a useful concept to model. For example a
     pci device in a powered-off slot could be marked as hidden until the s=
lot is
     powered on (mst).
3. Management layer software should handle this. Open Stack already has
  components/code to handle unplug/replug VFIO devices and metadata to
  provide to the guest for detecting which devices should be paired.
  -> An approach that includes all software from firmware to
     higher-level management software wasn't tried in the last years. This =
is
     an attempt to keep it simple and contained in QEMU as much as possible=
.
     One of the problems that stopped management software and libvirt from
     implementing this idea is that it can't be sure that it's possible to
     re-plug the primary device. By not freeing the devices resources in QE=
MU
     and only asking the guest OS to unplug it is possible to re-plug the
     device in case of a migration failure.
4. Hotplugging a device and then making it part of a failover setup is
   not possible
  -> addressed by extending qdev hotplug functions to check for hidden
     attribute, so e.g. device_add can be used to plug a device.


I have tested this with a mlx5 and igb NIC and was able to migrate the VM.

Command line example:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 3072 -smp 3 \
        -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Dsplit -cpu host   \
        -serial stdio   \
        -net none \
        -qmp unix:/tmp/qmp.socket,server,nowait \
        -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot0,multifunction=3Don,chassis=3D0,ad=
dr=3D0xa \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot1,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D1 \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot2,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D2 \
        -netdev tap,script=3D/root/bin/bridge.sh,downscript=3Dno,id=3Dhostn=
et1,vhost=3Don \
        -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet1,id=3Dnet1,mac=3D52:54:00:6=
f:55:cc,bus=3Droot2,failover=3Don \
=09-device vfio-pci,host=3D5e:00.2,id=3Dhostdev0,bus=3Droot1,failover_pair_=
id =3Dnet1 \
        /root/rhel-guest-image-8.0-1781.x86_64.qcow2

I'm grateful for any remarks or ideas!

Thanks!
