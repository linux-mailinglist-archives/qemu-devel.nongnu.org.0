The scenario which I tested this with was no <emulatorpin/> but using
'virsh emulatorpin' afterwards to pin emulator thread somewhere. For
those which are unfamiliar with libvirt, this is about placing the main
qemu TID (with the main eventloop) into a CGroup that restricts on what
CPUs it can run.

That's not exactly what I saw. I would have thought too that initially
the prealloc thread could be spawned just anywhere but after few
iterations the scheduler realized what NUMA node the thread is close to
and automatically schedule it to run there. Well, it didn't happen.

Indeed, but it's at least somewhat restricted. NB, in real scenario
users will map guest NUMA nodes onto host ones with 1:1 relationship.
And each guest NUMA node will have its own memdev=, i.e. its own set of
threads, so in the end, prealloc threads won't jump between host NUMA
nodes but stay local to the node they are allocating memory on.

Yes, I had to disable capability dropping in qemu.conf.

After all, I think maybe the right place to fix this is kernel? I mean,
why don't prealloc threads converge to the nodes they are working with?
