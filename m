Document work-flows for
  * enabling/detecting modern CPU hotplug interface
  * finding a CPU with pending 'insert/remove' event
  * enumerating present and possible CPUs

v2:
 - fix indent of "other values" that's just above
   being added "Typical usecases:" section
 - unindent "Typical usecases" to put it into right scope
   (Laszlo)
 - squash in ammended (using CPHP_GET_NEXT_CPU_WITH_EVENT_CMD)
   "acpi: cpuhp: spec: document procedure for  enabling modern CPU hotplug"
