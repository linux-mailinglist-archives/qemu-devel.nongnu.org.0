I donâ€™t really understand the problem here.Â  If the block job only 
operates on the sibling subgraph, why would it care whatâ€™s going on in 
the other subgraph?

Block jobs should own all nodes that are associated with them (e.g. 
because they intend to drop or replace them when the job is done), so 
when part of the graph is drained, all jobs that could modify that part 
should be drained, too.

Well, sounds complicated.Â  So Iâ€™m asking myself whether this would be 
noticeably better than just an RwLock for graph modifications, like the 
global lock Vladimir has proposed.
