Indeed, thanks.

I've switched to -1 as suggested. Regarding the alignment for reservations, the
specification does require this, although I do not recall seeing any enforcement
of this by qemu itself.

New diff follows.

Subject: [PATCH] Clear load reservations on qemu riscv target

This prevents a load reservation from being placed in one context/process,
then being used in another, resulting in an SC succeeding incorrectly and
breaking atomics.
