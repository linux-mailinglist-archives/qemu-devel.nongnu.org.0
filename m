OK, sounds good.  I'll look at the exact rewording on v+1.

I guess it has to do with packages that can interact or serve other
languages.  Or, that are (partially) written in another language?

AFAICT, the classifiers are about letting people search for packages
that match a given criteria.  It's all metadata, so the benefits are
not super tangible.  I've used those to keep track / document the
Python versions that I know the project has been actively tested on,
and that's the reason of my comment about (CI) test jobs.

Right, but I had the impression that activating it in develop mode (at
least) was the intention down the line.

This is a minor suggestion: use CentOS 8 stock Python 3.6 packages,
and then Fedora 33 with also stock Python 3.9.  Even though all
tools are pinned, it's still a good idea to test at least min/max
(if not all) Python versions.

- Cleber.
