What I see there is a discussion on the relation between relaxed access 
and MIO without explaining to Connie that we have in the kernel the 
possibility to know if a device support MIO or not independently of it 
supports the relaxed access.

The all point here is about taking decisions for the right reasons.

We have the possibility to take the decision based on functionalities 
and not on a specific PCI function.


If we keep the PFT check, and we can do this of course, but is it a good 
solution if it appears we have other PFT with the same functionalities?

Please note that this is a minor code change, keeping track of the MIO 
support just as we keep track of the PFT and check on this instead of on 
the PFT.

It does not modify the general architecture of the patch series neither 
in kernel nor in QEMU at all.
