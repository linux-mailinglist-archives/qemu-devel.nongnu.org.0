It's a vendor defined string, it should be considered opaque to the
user, the vendor can include whatever they feel is relevant.

I thought that was the purpose of this attribute.

What is "software version of vendor specific migration code"?  If
you're asking whether anything will check for parent device
compatibility or parent vendor driver compatibility, the answer is no,
that's what this interface is meant to provide.  Userspace should need
to do nothing more than verify the mdev types match and then use the
version attribute to confirm source to target compatibility.

We can make recommendations as "best practices", but ultimately it's an
opaque string defined by the vendor driver.

But you never addressed my comment that previous reviews asked for the
attribute to be named something more specific to migration.

We don't support aggregation yet, but yes, that's going to introduce
issues here.  Any configuration beyond the base mdev type would imply
that the base type could be compatible for migration, but the specific
instances might not.  Resolving that would imply that our version
information needs to be relative to an instance, not just the base type.

How would we extend this interface to support that?  We could have a
version attribute on each device instance, which might report something
like:

  0123456789,aggregate=3D2

IOW the device instance of version concatenates the mdev type version
with the additional create parameters for that device.  Writing this to
the type attribute should be parsed by the vendor driver as support for
given base device with specified additional create parameters.

I'm afraid this also bring us around to treacherous questions around
who is responsible for creating that device on the migration target and
where is this meta information about the device exposed.  Maybe instead
of a per instance version attribute we would instead expose the create
parameters as an attribute per instance and it would be userspace's
responsibility to create a version string from the mdev type and create
parameters similar to above.  This would also make it possible to
create a compatible instance on the target without pre-knowledge of how
the device was created.

Also, this issue exists already, but compatibility and capacity are two
separate things, I think we want to limit this interface to the
former.  For instance, if I want to migrate an i915-GVTg_V5_1 device to
another system where available_instances for that type is zero, the
version attribute should strictly report the device compatibility, it's
not responsible for returning an errno due to lack of resources.
Similarly if we were to do something with aggregation, the version
attribute would strictly report if the target supports creating that
device with those parameters, not whether it has capacity to create
such as device at that instant in time.

If we start adding creation parameters, PATH_MAX may actually be the

I think we're discussing an interface that validates "I [the vendor
driver] am able to import the state of this version", therefore it must
include every relevant aspect of the vendor support for that.

Yes, I think it might be overly complicated to provide different
attribute groups for different devices, we have more flexibility if the
user does not make any assumptions based only on the presence of a
version attribute.

The string is opaque to the user, so if you're asking in (3) that the
user read and parse some information in the string that indicates the
device is non-migratable then no, I don't agree with that policy.  If
reading the version attribute produces a result, the only thing the
user can do with that result is to test it by writing it to another
version attribute.  Thanks,
