  mailing list thread:

  A workaround for this problem would be to check for page crossings for
  both the user and system modes in the use_goto_tb() function across
  targets. Some targets like "hppa" already implement this fix but others
  don't.

  To solve the root cause of this problem, the linux-user/mmap.c should
  be fixed to do all the invalidations required. By doing so, better
  performance results could be achieved, compared to the case of the
