You need an expert opinion.

My non-expert opinion: we can't distribute anything that's not
compatible with GPLv2, at least as long as LICENSE makes the following
claims:

    1) QEMU as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License,
    version 2.

    2) Parts of QEMU have specific licenses which are compatible with the
    GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file contains
    its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing information
    are released under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your
    option) any later version.

    As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
    License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
    or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

    3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is released under the BSD license
       (see license headers in files).

Complicating things further just to distribute a firmware blob would be
a mistake.  Our licensing situation is already complex enough for me to
call it a mistake.
