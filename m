That's a better name. I was stuck in the old code (which was concerned
about what a symbol name means at which point) rather than thinking
about high-level concepts.

Both are valid spellings and I generally don't expect correct spellings
to be corrected, but arguably "free-form" is more standard. I'll change
it. (If we were consistent, the method should have been named
_append_free_form rather than _append_freeform originally...)

I would gladly correct a sentence not starting with a capital letter if
I could see any. The quoted sentence starts with a capital "A" in the
previous line.

Again both are valid, but this time, "any more" is the more standard
spelling.

If you use enums in a boolean context, you're doing something wrong
anyway. *shrug*

I'll change it, it's consistent with real Enum classes where the values
becomes non-integer objects (which therefore evaluate as True in boolean
contexts).

This is just what Python enums look like... I could move the class
outside of QAPIDoc to save that part of the prefix, but I'd prefer not
to.

I could just have added a boolean that decides whether a symbol is an
argument or a feature. That would have been a minimal hack that
wouldn't involve any enums.

I intentionally decided not to do that because the whole structure of
the parser was horribly confusing to me and I felt that introducing a
clear state machine would improve its legibility a lot. I still think
that this is what it did.

If you don't like a proper state machine, I can do that bool thing. I
don't think throwing in function pointers would be very helpful for
readers, so we'd get a major code change for no gain.
