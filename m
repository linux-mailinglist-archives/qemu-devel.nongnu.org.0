That's right.

(I'm realizing that this is maybe not a constraint that we should even 
anticipate here, because maybe we don't wish to say that the parent 
should always be of the same type. but hey, it led to a good mypy lesson.

I'm going to edit it to do the simpler thing for now and leave well 
enough alone. There's another chance to see an interesting pattern of 
TypeVars in the error series in part 4 that I think is actually more 
explicitly appropriate.)

Yup!

Here's a little sample program that shows what this kind of typing does:

```
from typing import TypeVar, Optional

class Example:
     T = TypeVar('T', bound='Example')
     def __init__(self: T, parent: Optional[T] = None):
         self.parent = parent

class SubExample(Example):
     pass


x = Example()
y = Example(x)
z = SubExample()
a = Example(x)            # OK
b = Example(z)            # OK
c = SubExample(x)         # BZZZT
d = SubExample(z)         # OK
```

If you check this with mypy, you'll get this error:

```
test.py:17: error: Argument 1 to "SubExample" has incompatible type 
"Example"; expected "Optional[SubExample]"
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```

You could, but I suggested on IRC the other day that I am not fully 
comfortable with the LSP rules that mypy (sometimes?) enforces. I tend 
not to want to override init with narrower types if I can avoid it, but 
it is true that we do this quite a lot in the codebase already.

(I believe I have seen mypy throw errors about this on occasion, but I 
can't pinpoint the exact circumstances in which it does. It's a point of 
confusion for me.)

I'm not sure if bound is strictly required or not. mypy docs just use it 
outright and don't mention why:

https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#generic-methods-and-generic-self

Generally, this constrains a TypeVar to some upper bound, see --

https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#type-variables-with-upper-bounds 


-- but in this case, we're only using that TypeVar for an init method 
that only exists for this type and below, so it might be redundant.

I modified my example program to remove the bound and it appears to fail 
in the same exact way, so it might be pointless in this case. It might 
have a stronger use if you want to re-use the 'T' typevar elsewhere 
where it isn't implicitly bound by the 'self' argument. Maybe it has 
implications for multi-inheritance too, I've not tested it to that level.


Thanks for the good question!
