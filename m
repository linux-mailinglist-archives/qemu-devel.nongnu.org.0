Some kind of somewhat standardized marker for driver/version seems like
a good idea. Further checking is also a good idea, but I think the
details of that need to be left to the individual drivers.

Getting both populated from the same source seems like a good idea.

Not sure if a string is the best value to put into a migration stream;
maybe the sysfs interface can derive a human-readable string from a
more compact value to be put into the migration region (and ultimately
the stream)? Might be overengineering, just thinking out aloud here.
