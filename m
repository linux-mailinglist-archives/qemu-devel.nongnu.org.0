BTW if after 4 weeks and 2 pings nobody sent negative feedback or
NAcked your series, it usually means the community is not against
your purposal, but has some doubts this feature is necessary or
well designed. Tests help to show your work is safe, as it doesn't
break anything. You might need to better explain why this feature
is needed, and what are the limitations of what is currently
possible.

OTOH QEMU has been in "feature freeze" for the next v6.0 release
for the same amount of time, so maybe the maintainers/reviewers
were busy with bugs and still have your series in their TODO list.

Regards,

Phil.
