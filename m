For Linux targets, it should be possible to have exclusively container
based testing environments. At worst you can run a privileged container
and expose arbitrary host resources to it, so you can do anything in
the container that you would otherwise do in bare metal. For non-Linux,
we should be able to satisfy our needs with VMs, and indeed VMs can
be used for Linux too if we want to emulate some specific hardware for
testing that we don't have accessible to containers on bare metal.
IOW, the testing environment can be entirely defined by the recipes
we have in tests/docker and tests/vm. Bare metal hosts are simply a
way to host the containers or vms.

Daniel
