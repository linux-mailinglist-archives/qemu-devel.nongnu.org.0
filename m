In write-blocking mode, all writes to the top node directly go to the
target.  We must only mirror chunks of data that are aligned to the
job's granularity, because that is how the dirty bitmap works.
Therefore, the request alignment for writes must be the job's
granularity (in write-blocking mode).

Unfortunately, this forces all reads and writes to have the same
granularity (we only need this alignment for writes to the target, not
the source), but that is something to be fixed another time.
