This section shouldn't be added at the end of the document, but after
the last section that describes a header extension (I think this is
'Full disk encryption header pointer').

Also, let me mention that I'm not reviewing the documentation wording in
detail because Markus has already given a lot of good feedback that I
don't want to duplicate.
