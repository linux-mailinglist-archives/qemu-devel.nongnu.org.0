It should fix KVM split irqchip with resamplefd, so I think it's
natural to do this in kvm-all.c (I'm a bit puzzled on where else we
can put this... :).  Or did I misunderstood your question?

Sure.

For documentation: as mentioned above, I think the irqfd users will
always use the interface just like before, and the resamplefd should
work exactly like what KVM_IRQFD and kvm_irqchip_assign_irqfd() was
offering before this patch too.  IMO it'll just start to work even for
split irqchips which was silently broken without being noticed.
