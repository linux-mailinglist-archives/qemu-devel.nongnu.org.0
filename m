Which is why it currently returns NULL for Quorum.

Not wrong.  But the same question as for raw arises: Is there any use to
declaring qcow2 an R/W filter driver just because it fits the definition?=

I suppose that=E2=80=99s an exclusive =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=9D?  Because I us=
e =E2=80=9Dbacking chain=E2=80=9D to
refer to COW chains exclusively.

Such a chain may or may not include filters, but they are not really
load-bearing nodes of the chain.  As such, I generally want to skip them
when looking at a backing chain (hence e.g. bdrv_backing_chain_next()).

=46rom what I can tell nobody has ever formalized any terms regarding COW=

backing chains or R/W filter chains.  This series is an attempt.

So?

Should we treat it as a filter when @offset is 0 but otherwise not?
That totally wouldn=E2=80=99t be confusing to users.

I have no idea what your point is.  There is no point in making it a
filter tree at this point, just as we never had a backing tree.

And the good example is Quorum.  qcow2 is a bad example because there is
no benefit in marking it an R/W filter for its external data file,
exactly like is the case for raw.

So exactly the same as =E2=80=9Cbs->backing=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cbacking =
chain=E2=80=9D for me.

You disagreeing with me on these terms to me shows that there is a need
to formalize.  This is precisely what I want to do in this series.

The fact that we don=E2=80=99t use the term =E2=80=9Cfilter chain=E2=80=9D=
 so far is the reason
why I introduce it.  Because it comes as a clean slate.  =E2=80=9Cbacking=
 chain=E2=80=9D
already means something to me, and it means something different.
