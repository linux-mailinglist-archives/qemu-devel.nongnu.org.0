Loss of QAPI introspection is the killer.

We have QOM introspection, but it's far too weak to serve as
replacement.  Besides, two introspection facilities is one too many.

Use of a QAPI schema rather than code to define user-facing QOM
properties provides QAPI introspection for QOM.  Having that would be
lovely.

Bonus: in QOM, documenting types takes effort.  Consequently,
user-facing QOM is mostly undocumented.  In a QAPI schema, *not*
documenting stuff takes effort: the QAPI generator insists on
documentation.

Eduardo (cc'ed) mentioned he'd like to work towards defining properties
in a QAPI schema.

I sympathize with this long term vision.

Nevertheless, we need Kevin's work now to get a decent storage daemon
CLI while that's still easy to do.  We'll have to promise stability
soon, and then changes get much harder.
