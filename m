Is that specific _generations_ or specific _machines_ (i.e. those with
an appropriate key)? If the latter, maybe add a note that a specific
image is bound to (a) specific machine(s)?

Also, maybe add

"Running PVMs requires using the KVM hypervisor."

"is done via the `genprotimg` tool from the s390-tools collection"
