So I think I'm confusing this description with the code I'm seeing
above.  The code above, being in ram_find_and_save_block makes me think
it's calling ram_copy_page for every page at the point just before it
writes it - I'm not seeing how that corresponds to what you're saying
about it being queued when the CPU tries to write it.

Right, same type of problem as postcopy.
