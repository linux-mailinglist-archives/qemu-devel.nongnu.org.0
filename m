It does not include the size of metadata, the "rbd_diff_iterate2"
function is literally just looking for touched data blocks within the
RBD image.

It should return 13 dirty data blocks (multipled by the size of the
data block) since when you don't provide a "from snapshot" name, it
will iterate from the first snapshot to the HEAD revision.
