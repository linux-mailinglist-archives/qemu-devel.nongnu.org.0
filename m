Yeah that would be preferrable. If that's really not possible, we
could likely provide some API to query the expected hreader size for
a given set of creation options.=20

Yes, it will be zeros at the physical layer, but unintelligble
garbage from POV of the virtual disk.

I don't think this is really a problem though - this is what you
get already if you create a LUKS volume on top of a block device
today.

AFAIK, we've not documented that preallocation guarantees future
reads will return zeros. Preallocation simply ensures that all
required space is allocated upfront. We do mention that it might
be achieved by writing zeros to the underlying storage but never
said you'll get zeros back.

IOW I think its at most a docs problem to more clearly explain
that preallocation !=3D guaranteed zeros for reads.

Certainly not. LUKS on raw is going to be very common, not least because
that's directly compatible with what Linux kernel supports. If you don't
want the features of qcow2 like snapshots, it just adds overhead and mgmt
complexity for no gain, especially if dealing with block device backed
storage (iSCSI, RBD).

OpenStack will use cryptsetup when initializing its block storage with
LUKS, then tell QEMU to run with the raw + LUKS driver.
