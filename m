But cri-o and docker containers run as root, isn't it? (or atleast have
the capability to run as root). Havind said that, it will be nice to be able
to run virtiofsd without root. 

There are few hurdles though.

- For file creation, we switch uid/gid (seteuid/setegid) and that seems
  to require root. If we were to run unpriviliged, probably all files
  on host will have to be owned by unpriviliged user and guest visible
  uid/gid will have to be stored in xattrs. I think virtfs supports
  something similar.

I am sure there are other restrictions but this probably is the biggest
one to overcome.

Or may be issue is that standard seccomp.json does not allow unshare()
and hence you are forced to use a non-standar seccomp.json.
