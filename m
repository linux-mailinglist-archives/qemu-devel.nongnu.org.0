Additionally, please insert "on Linux" into the first paragraph, like
this:

  When QEMU exposes a VirtIO-RNG device to the guest, that device needs a
  source of entropy, and that source needs to be "non-blocking", like
  `/dev/urandom`.  However, currently QEMU defaults to the problematic
  `/dev/random`, which on Linux is "blocking" (as in, it waits until
  sufficient entropy is available).
