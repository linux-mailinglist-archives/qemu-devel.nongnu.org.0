Thanks for investigating it. However there are at least two problems with 
that idea:

1. OpenBIOS does not yet understand standard PCI ROM headers, it can only 
handle NDRV and PEF ROMs yet so first support for that (and FCode ROMs) 
should be added to OpenBIOS.

2. Building rom images from different sources (in this case your vgabios 
and QemuMacDrivers for the NDRV) might not be straightforward (maybe some 
clever make rules would take care of these without too much hassle but I'm 
not sure, this would mean rebuilding binary if any of the two sources 
change).

Plus I don't know if other firmwares such as sam460ex U-Boot can handle 
such multiplatform ROMs, especially because it can use x86 ROM just not 
the QEMU vgabios due to not emulating i386 specific opcodes that gcc puts 
in real mode code so it needs something compiled with bcc such as 
Plex86/Bochs VGABios so then we can't put those in one binary because we 
had two x86 images in it. Therefore I think setting this based on machine 
like above is probably the easiest way for now.

I'll wait for Mark's comments before going further with this.
