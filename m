Title:
  disk driver with iothread setting hangs live migrations

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Per report raised at
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1790093

  Description of problem:

  A disk driver definition using iothread parameter causes live
  migration with copy storage to hang during or just before the final
  ram sync stage.

  Interestingly, having the scsi controller as a separate iothread does
  not trigger the issue.

  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

  I can reproduce this on centos7 with qemu-ev and with centos 8:

  qemu-kvm-ev-2.12.0-33.1.el7_7.4.x86_64
  qemu-kvm-2.12.0-65.module_el8.0.0+189+f9babebb.5.x86_64

  Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Create a definition with 1 iothread on the disk image:

        <driver name=3D'qemu' type=3D'qcow2' iothread=3D'1' />

  2. Issue a live migrate request like: virsh migrate --live --copy-storage=
-all vm qemu+tcp://remote/system
  3. Live migrate on source copies storage and then hangs at 80-99%, I gues=
s during the ram copy phase.

  Keeping exactly the same config but without the iothread on the disk
  driver has successful migrations every time.
