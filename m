Title:
  Stack address is returned from function translate_one

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The vulnerable version is qemu-2.8.0, and the vulnerable function is
  in "target-s390x/translate.c".

  The code snippet is as following.

  static ExitStatus translate_one(CPUS390XState *env, DisasContext *s)
  {
      const DisasInsn *insn;
      ExitStatus ret =3D NO_EXIT;
      DisasFields f;
      ...
      s->fields =3D &f;
      ...
      s->pc =3D s->next_pc;
      return ret;
  }

  A stack address, i.e. the address of local variable "f" is returned
  from current function through the output parameter "s->fields" as a
  side effect.

  This issue is one kind of undefined behaviors, according the C
  Standard, 6.2.4 [ISO/IEC 9899:2011]
  (https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/c/DCL30-C.+Declare+=
objects+with+appropriate+storage+durations)

  This dangerous defect may lead to an exploitable vulnerability.
  We suggest sanitizing "s->fields" as null before return.

  Note that this issue is reported by shqking and Zhenwei Zou together.
