I think we are in agreement here.  We don't need to make the new
introspection mechanism part of query-qmp-schema, but I think it
should use the same abstractions.

We have users that don't have access to stderr.  They might have
access to log files, but log files are pretty bad user
interfaces.  If it's important for some set of human users, apps
using libvirt or QMP need access to that information so they can
show it to their human users too.

Absolutely.

I'd say it should provide it to apps, otherwise this won't be
more useful than the existing log files.

I don't think I understand this description of "static".  I
expect the data to be fixed at build time, but I expect it to be
different in downstream distributions of QEMU.

The static vs. dynamic distinction is getting me confused.  Why
are the more expressive solutions more dynamic than "list of
strings"?  Can you give examples?

Also, why do we want to place all info inside the same "features"
attribute instead of just adding new fields to SchemaInfoObject?

i.e. why are these options:

  { "members" [ ... ],
    "features": [ "dynamic-read-only", "deprecated" ] }

  { "members" [ ... ],
    "features": [ "dynamic-read-only",
                  { "deprecated": true, "hint": "FOO" } ] }

better than these options:

  { "members" [ ... ],
    "features": [ "dynamic-read-only" ],
    "deprecated": true }

  { "members" [ ... ],
    "features": [ "dynamic-read-only" ],
    "deprecation-info": { "deprecated": true, "hint": "FOO" } }
