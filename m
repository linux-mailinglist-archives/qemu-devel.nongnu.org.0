Yes actually it makes sense. :)

Though I do think it should hardly happen, otherwise even if it's
waked up it'll still try to access that GPA and KVM will be confused
on that and exit because no memslot was setup for that.  Then I think
it's a fatal VM error.  In other words, I feel like the resizing
should be blocked somehow by that stall vcpu too (e.g., even if we
want to reboot a Linux guest, it'll sync between vcpus, and same to
bootstraping).

Btw, I feel like we cannot always depend on the fact that userfaultfd
will dissapear itself if the VMA is unmapped, because even it's true
it'll only be true for shrinking of memories.  How about extending
memory in the future?  So IIUC if we want to really fix this, we
probably need to take care of uffd register and unregister of changed
memory regions, which AFAIUI can be done inside your newly introduced
resize hook...

We probably need to take care of other things that might be related to
ramblock resizing too in the same notifier.  One I can think of is to
realloc the ramblock.receivedmap otherwise we could have some bit
cleared forever for shrinking memories (which logically when migration
finishes that bitmap should be all set).

Thanks,
