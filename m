Well I by default expect that if the top level array has data for all
node names the nesting which repeats the information (partially) should
not be there because you can just look elsewhere for a more detailed
output.

Said that two years ago I wrote some code which detects the node names
from running qemu because at that time it was the only way to use the
block write threshold event. This code needs to extract the nesting
topology somehow but I don't remember nor fancy re-understanding the
algorithm for the detection during the hollidays. The only thing I can
say that the nesting is extracted either from the output of query-block
or from query-named-block nodes as both these outputs are fed to that
algorithm.

With blockdev that piece of code thankfully is unused, but unfortunately
I can't say that the nested output of query-named-block-nodes doesn't
have it's use.
