IMHO, in my opinion, regardless of LOC, duplicated code is almost always
bad. Common functions are mostly for the next guy that will be able to us=
e
them instead of searching through code to see how this is done there and =
there.

I don't think this is bad, again in my eyes, the code should be as friend=
ly
as possible for the next guy that will have to change it, so adding
some more extra changes don't seem a problem to me.
Of course this is only my personal option and each approach has its own c=
ons,
and pros. This doesn't matter that much to me.
