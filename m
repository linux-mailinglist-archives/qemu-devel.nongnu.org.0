For x86, do we really need to be using custom runners ?

With GitLab if someone forks the repo to their personal namespace, they
cannot use any custom runners setup by the origin project. So if we use
custom runners for x86, people forking won't be able to run the GitLab
CI jobs.

As a sub-system maintainer I wouldn't like this, because I ideally want
to be able to run the same jobs on my staging tree, that Peter will run
at merge time for the PULL request I send.

Thus my strong preference would be to use the GitLab runners in every
scenario where they are viable to use. Only use custom runners in the
cases where GitLab runners are clearly inadequate for our needs.

Based on what we've setup in GitLab for libvirt,  the shared runners
they have work fine for x86. Just need the environments you are testing
to be provided as Docker containers (you can actually build and cache
the container images during your CI job too).  IOW, any Linux distro
build and test jobs should be able to use shared runners on x86, and
likewise mingw builds. Custom runners should only be needed if the
jobs need todo *BSD / macOS builds, and/or have access to specific
hardware devices for some reason.

Daniel
