Ah I see. That's a shame, as something based on guest RAM size feels like
a much safer bet for a default heuristic than basing it on host RAM size.

I'd probably say that the original commit which changed the argument
processing is flawed, and could/should be fixed.

The problem that commit was trying to solve was to do validation of the
value passed to -m. In fixing that it also moving the parsing. The key
problem here is that we need to do parsing and validating at different
points in the startup procedure.  IOW, we need to split the logic, not
simply moving the CLI parsing to the place that makes validation work.

Daniel
