Title:
  Ubuntu 16.04.1 Grub Splash Doesn't Appear

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  My Specs:

  Slackware 14.2 x86_64 > Host
  QEMU 2.7.0

  Ubuntu 16.04.1 x86_64 > Guest

  Start options for Ubuntu:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=3Draw,file=3Dubuntu.img \
  -cpu host \
  --enable-kvm \
  -smp 2 \
  -m 4096 \
  -vga vmware \
  -soundhw ac97 \
  -usbdevice tablet \
  -rtc base=3Dlocaltime \
  -usbdevice host:0781:5575

  I've started Ubuntu around 6-8 times, and I have only see the Grub
  Boot Splash appear twice, so pretty much without fail it typically
  boots past the grub splash and automatically boots...

  These are the /etc/default/grub settings; (I only changed these
  options GRUB_TIMEOUT=3D15 and GRUB_GFXMODE=3D1440x900)

  # If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
  # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.
  # For full documentation of the options in this file, see:
  #   info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'

  GRUB_DEFAULT=3D0
  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=3D0
  GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=3Dtrue
  GRUB_TIMEOUT=3D15
  GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=3D`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=3D"quiet splash"
  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=3D""

  # Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs
  # This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obta=

  #GRUB_BADRAM=3D"0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef"

  # Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
  #GRUB_TERMINAL=3Dconsole

  # The resolution used on graphical terminal
  # note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via V=
BE
  # you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
  GRUB_GFXMODE=3D1440x900

  # Uncomment if you don't want GRUB to pass "root=3DUUID=3Dxxx" parameter =
to Linux
  #GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=3Dtrue

  # Uncomment to disable generation of recovery mode menu entries
  #GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY=3D"true"

  # Uncomment to get a beep at grub start
