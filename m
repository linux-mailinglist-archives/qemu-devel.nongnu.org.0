OK for this part. However, in an ideal emulation world, the floppy drive controller shouldn't know
what is the current DMA mode.
I would remove this whole dma_mode_ok thing, and always assume that operating system does a sane thing.
Then, get_transfer_mode() callback and the ISADMA_TRANSFER_* defines can also be removed.

It doesn't seem good to me, as it fixes VERIFY mode only for fdc.
Can you try to remove this part, and replace it by the following one (not tested) ?

--- a/hw/dma/i8257.c
+++ b/hw/dma/i8257.c
@@ -428,6 +428,11 @@ static int i8257_dma_write_memory(IsaDma *obj, int nchan, void *buf, int pos,

We may also fix i8257_dma_{read,write}_memory to correctly check for mode and refuse to
do anything if mode is wrong.
