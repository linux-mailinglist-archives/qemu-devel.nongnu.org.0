In case of 2.1, we need to have the arch_id already generated. This is
done inside possible_cpu_arch_ids. The arch_id is used by
machine_set_cpu_numa_node to assign the cpus to correct numa node.

If we want to move the arch_id generation into board init(), then we need
to save the cpu indexes belonging to each node somewhere.

This is going to be difficult without touching the generic numa code.

>=20

> what handlers do you mean?

Apicid generation logic can be separated into 3 types of handlers.
x86_apicid_from_cpu_idx: Generate apicid from cpu index.
x86_topo_ids_from_apicid: Generate topo ids from apic id.
x86_apicid_from_topo_ids: Generate apicid from topo ids.

We should be able to generate one id from other(you can see topology.h).

X86CPUDefinition will have the handlers specific to each model like the
way we have features now. The above 3 handlers will be used as default
handler.


The EPYC model will have its corresponding handlers.

x86_apicid_from_cpu_idx_epyc
x86_topo_ids_from_apicid_epyc
x86_apicid_from_topo_ids_epyc.

PCMachineState will have the function pointers to the above handlers.
I was going to load the correct handler based on the mode type.

My code for the current approach is kind of ready(yet to be tested). I can
send it as v3.1 if you want to look. Or we can wait for our discussion to
settle. I will post it after our discussion.


There is one more problem we need to address. I was going to address later
in v4 or v5.

This works
-numa node,nodeid=3D0,cpus=3D0-3 -numa node,nodeid=3D1,cpus=3D4-7

This does not work
-numa node,nodeid=3D0,cpus=3D0-5 -numa node,nodeid=3D1,cpus=3D6-7

This requires the generic code to pass the node information to the x86
code which requires some handler changes. I was thinking my code will
simplify the changes to address this issue.
