Then, in function mips_tcg_init(), cpu_gpr[i] is created one by one with
tcg_global_mem_new(...) in a for loop. Is that all I need to do to add new
registers to the CPU? I noticed another file "cpu.h", do I also need to add
my new registers, say, "my_gpr[32]" in "cpu.h"?

Shouldn't they be created with tcg_global_mem_new(...), just like how the
registers are created? I can hack the memory by creating a *super* larger
register file, and hack the loads & stores with register moves, but that
just sounds too sketchy.

For register definition, load/store instruction, take a look at details of
this series:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-10/msg06028.html

Don't mix register and memory initialization. For memory, the existing code
should bu sufficient.

What you need to additionally do (and you didn't mention it) is to define a
CPU that will have some base instruction set (it coukd be, for example,
mips32r2) + your additional instructions. This is done in file by adding a
corresponding item in translate_init.inc.c (if you choise mips32r2 as base
ISA, you could base your new CPU on existing CPU 24Kf). And then you start
QEMU with switch "-cpu <your newly defined CPU>".

I may add more explanation later on.

that function "mips_cpu_dump_state" in "translate.c" does what I need, but
I don't know how to call it in this process. Should I use gdb?

The questions are always fine and welcome, just we are typically very busy,
snd can't always promptly replay.
