Sorry, my #8 was really long.  All builds I've done were in clean
chroots, so starting from scratch with just git source, with no
interference from other builds.  Also later in #8, I show that
--disable-glusterfs doesn't work because some part of the build looks
for the .so that was never built.

Luckily, be812c0 was easy enough to just manually revert on top of
4.1.0.

And, good news.  (I hope!)  4.1.0 with be812c0 manually reverted on top
of it prevents the bug, even WITHOUT "max_outputs=3D1".

Title:
  Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.  virt-viewer 8.0.

  Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

  Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using
  integrated ASPEED graphics.

  Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DNyMdcYwOCvY

  Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH3nGG2Mk6i0

  4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.

  Using 4.1.0 with virtio-vga doesn't cause this.
