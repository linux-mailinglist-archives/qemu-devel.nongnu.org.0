I think I would prefer some text phrased in a way that more
explicitly states what the frontend code has to do, like:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
When the translator is handling an instruction of this kind:
 * it must call gen_io_start() if icount is enabled, at some
   point before the generation of the code which actually does
   the I/O, using a code fragment similar to:
        if (tb_cflags(s->base.tb) & CF_USE_ICOUNT) {
            gen_io_start();
        }
 * it must end the TB immediately after this instruction

Note that some older front-ends call a "gen_io_end()" function:
this is obsolete and should not be used.
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
