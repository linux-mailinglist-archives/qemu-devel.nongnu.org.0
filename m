Thought about that too, but I don't think this is a good idea for
buffers which exist for a long time.

Example #1:  A video decoder would setup a bunch of buffers and use
them robin-round, so they would exist until the video playback is
finished.

Example #2:  virtio-gpu creates a framebuffer for fbcon which exists
forever.  And virtio-gpu potentially needs lots of buffers.  With 3d
active there can be tons of objects.  Although they typically don't
stay around that long we would still need a pretty big virtqueue to
store them all I guess.

And it also doesn't fully match the virtio spirit, it still assumes
direct guest memory access.  Without direct guest memory access
updates to the fbcon object would never reach the host for example.
In case a iommu is present we might need additional dma map flushes
for updates happening after submitting the lingering "create-buffer"
command.

cheers,
  Gerd
