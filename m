Hi Geroggrey,
  I wonder if the same thing can be done by using the existing vhost-user
mechanism.

  vhost-user is intended for implementing a virtio device outside of the
qemu process; so it has a character device that qemu passes commands down
to the other process, where qemu mostly passes commands via the virtio
queues.   To be able to read the virtio queues, the external process
mmap's the same memory as the guest - it gets passed a 'set mem table'
command by qemu that includes fd's for the RAM, and includes base/offset
pairs saying that a particular chunk of RAM is mapped at a particular
guest physical address.

  Whether or not you make use of virtio queues, I think the mechanism
for the device to tell the external process the mappings might be what
you're after.
