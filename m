Here's what I'm using locally to let my finger memory of building 
in-tree work in spite of having done 'mkdir build; cd build; 
../configure ...'.  We'd still need glue code in configure itself to 
detect when it is being invoked in-tree to create a subdir build/ and 
such a forwarding file, but if we want in-tree to FEEL like it works 
(even though it uses a build dir under the hood), it's certainly worth 
considering.

$ cat GNUmakefile
# Hack for redirecting while reminding myself to use distinct builddir
ifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),)
recurse: all
endif
.NOTPARALLEL: %
%: force
	@echo 'changing dir to build for $(MAKE) "$(MAKECMDGOALS)"...'
	@$(MAKE) -C build -f Makefile $(MAKECMDGOALS)
force: ;
.PHONY: force
GNUmakefile: ;
