Having an arbitrary-width integer should work.

It will suck a bit for the common case of sparse vector length support

	0x8000000000000000800000008000808b

(= [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 ] quadwords)

Since lengths above 16 quadwords remain theoretical for now though it's
probably OK as a compromise, though.

The most human-compatible approach would be some kind of list
comprehension syntax, but it's hard to justify that adding a whole new
syntax is justified at this point.
