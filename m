I don't think so.

If you ever call qdev_get_machine() before creating "/machine", you not
only get a bogus "container" object, you *also* set "/machine" to that
object.  When main() later attempts to create the real "/machine", it
fails with "attempt to add duplicate property 'machine' to object (type
'container')", and aborts.  See commit 1a3ec8c1564 and e2fb3fbbf9c.

I don't think qdev_get_machine() per se is the problem.  Its side effect
is.  Quoting myself:

    I think we should never create /machine as (surprising!) side effect of
    qdev_get_machine().  Create it explicitly instead, and have
    qdev_get_machine() use object_resolve_path("/machine", NULL) to get it.
