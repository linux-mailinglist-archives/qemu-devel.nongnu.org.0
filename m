In "[PATCH v4 00/20] monitor: add asynchronous command type", I
propose a way to defer monitor commands (both QMP and HMP). This
allows the main loop to reenter, and when the work is completed,
return the command. During that time, no other commands are accepted
(except OOB), effectively "blocking" the monitor.

The series probably doesn't apply cleanly anymore, I'll rebase and resubmit=
 it.
