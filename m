Ah, nice, quorum sets is_filter =3D true even though it neither fulfulls
the conditions for it before this series, nor the changed conditions
after this series.

So either quorum lies and isn't actually a filter driver, or our
definition in the documentation of is_filter is wrong.

Which is about the only possible choice that breaks the contract...

 * Return any filtered child, independently of how it reacts to write
 * accesses and whether data is copied onto this BDS through COR.

Maybe the documentation of bdrv_filtered_child() needs to be rephrased?

Going back to qcow2, it's really not much different as it has multiple
(two) filtered children, too. So if quorum returns NULL to mean "no
unambiguous result", why does it return bs->backing instead of NULL for
a qcow2 node?

(Yes, I know, because it's useful. But I'm trying to get some basic
consistency into these interfaces.)

Wait, where is there even a place where this could be declared?

The once thing I see that a driver even can declare is drv->is_filter,
which is about the whole driver and not about nodes. It is false for
qcow2.

Then you made some criteria above that tell us whether a specific child
of a node is a filtered child or not. As it happens, qcow2 (which is not
a filter driver) can have two children that match the criteria for being
filtered children.

I already think this is a bit inconsistent, because why should a driver
that declares itself a non-filter be considered to filter children?
Okay, you say a broader definition of a filtered child is useful because
you can then include all BdrvChild links in a backing/filter chain. Fair
enough, it's not intuitive, but use a broader definition then.

But the point where you say that even though two of the children
are filtered children under your broader definition, for the purpose of
the API only one of them should be considered because the other one
isn't that useful, that's really one inconsistency too much for me. You
can't use a broad definition and then arbitrarily restrict the
definition again so that it matches the special case you're currently
interested in.

Either use a narrow definition, or use a broad one. But use only one and
use it consistently.

Well, as you can see, this attempt feels confusing to me.

I agree with your naming of bdrv_backing_chain_next(), it's clear enough
what path it will follow down the graph. I just disagree that "filter
chain" is a good term for something that prefers backing file links when
it has a choice.

No, I'm just applying your definitions to see if the contradictions

My point is not about changing the logic in the code, but about using
names that actually describe accurately what the logic does.

And as I said above, neither is "not useful" a convincing argument for
ignoring filtered children (as I think we're trying to build something
rather generic, not something that works only for what we consider
useful today) nor do I see how qcow2 could be marked or not marked an
R/W filter (as mentioned above).

Well, if "backing chain" is too narrow, "filter chain" is both too
unspecific and inconsistent with the various definitions of "filter" and
"filtered" we're using, and we can't think of anything more concise, we
might have to use names that just mention both.

bdrv_cow_child() // don't call COW a filter, because .is_filter =3D false
bdrv_filter_child() // your R/W filter, only for .is_filter =3D true nodes
bdrv_filter_or_cow_child()

Or something like that. This would bring some more consistency into the
way we use the words filter/filtered at least.
