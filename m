I agree that QEMU should sanity check the resolution requested by the
guest. I also agree that "arbitrary" limits are acceptable, for
preventing integer overflows and -- hopefully -- memory allocation
failures too.

But I don't see the host kernel / OpenGL / physical GPU angle, at least
not directly. That angle seems to be specific to your particular use
case (particular choice of display backend).

For example, if you nest QEMU/TCG in QEMU/TCG, with no KVM and no device
assignment in the picture anywhere, and OVMF drives ramfb in L2, and the
display *backend* (such as GTK or SDL GUI window) for the QEMU process
running in L1 sits on top of a virtual device (such as bochs-display)
provided by QEMU running in L0, then the ramfb stuff (including the
resolution changes and the range checks) should work just the same,
between L2 and L1.

I kinda feel like ramfb has been hijacked for providing a boot time
display crutch for kvmgt. (I might not be using the correct terminology
here; sorry about that). That's *not* what ramfb was originally intended
for, as far as I recall. Compare:

- 59926de9987c ("Merge remote-tracking branch
'remotes/kraxel/tags/vga-20180618-pull-request' into staging", 2018-06-19)

- dddb37495b84 ("Merge remote-tracking branch
'remotes/awilliam/tags/vfio-updates-20181015.0' into staging", 2018-10-15)

IIRC, Gerd originally invented ramfb for giving AARCH64 Windows the
linear framebuffer that the latter so badly wants, in particular so that
the framebuffer exist in guest RAM (not in guest MMIO), in order to
avoid the annoying S1/S2 caching behavior of AARCH64/KVM when the guest
maps an area as MMIO that is mapped as RAM on the host [1]. See:

- https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=785#c4
- https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=785#c7
- https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=785#c8

and the further references given in those bugzilla comments.

[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1679680#c0

Component reuse is obviously *hugely* important, and it would be silly
for me to argue against reusing ramfb wherever it applies. Just please
don't break the original use case.

Should I file a bug report in LaunchPad, or is this thread enough for
tracking the QEMU regression?

Thanks
Laszlo
