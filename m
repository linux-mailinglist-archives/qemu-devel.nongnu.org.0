Doc comments do support full rST. However, (as the commit message
here notes), if you're generating a tree of docutils nodes and
one of them has a section heading in it then you'll get a result
that looks like this:

[root]
  - [ some section created by the script for a QAPI command ]
  - [ some section ]
      - [text nodes, etc going into this section]
      - [a section resulting from rST parsing the header inside the docstring]
  - [ next section created by the script for a QAPI command ]

(ie you'll have defined a subsection within whatever document
paragraph/section the current command is documenting, not
a new top-level subsection which subsequent commands will
become children of)

What you actually want is that the new header results in
a differently structured tree:
[root]
  - [ some section created by the script for a QAPI command ]
  - [ some section ]
      - [text nodes, etc going into this section]
  - [ a new top level section whose header is whatever this header is ]
     - [ next section created by the script is a child of that section ]
     - [ etc ]

There's no way to get that without actually noticing and handling
headings specially as being something entirely different from
a lump of documentation text. "A heading is a single-line special-case
of a freeform comment" happens to be the way we mark up headings
now in 99% of cases, so that's what I implemented. (The Sphinx
extension will complain if there's trailing junk lines after
a heading line at the beginning of a freeform comment block.
If you use '== something' in a line in the middle of a doc
comment, we'll just interpret that as rST source, which is to
say a couple of literal equals signs at the start of a line.)

thanks
