Cleber, hi.

Thanks for responding.

My views are very similar to Philippe's, but I will provide you with more
details of our (mips) perspective.

As far as black/whitelist issues that is a moot point for us - we only want
to be able to have a way to tag a test within the test itself (so, without
updating some common files, external lists,etc.)

In general, we would like to have a test environment where we would be able
to test what WE deem suitable for us, without feeling that we bother you or
anybody else, or that we are bothered by others.

Let me give you a little extreme example: Let's say we want a complex test
that downloads components from let's say fifty internet location, executes
zillion test cases, and last two days. I wouldn't like anybody to ask me
=E2=80=9CWhy would you that?=E2=80=9D or tell me =E2=80=9CYou can't do this=
.=E2=80=9D or say =E2=80=9CNo, we did
not anticipate such tests, patch rejected.=E2=80=9D I (we, people from mips=
) should
be able to define what I (we) need.

Having such test would be a big deal for me, not only that I could run it
manually or automatically every weekend, but I could ask submitters of
critical changes: =E2=80=9CDid you run this test that we have in Avocado di=
r?=E2=80=9D,
without specifying test details, procedures, etc. All this is a BIG deal
for me.

On the other hand, I agree that certain group of tests (envisioned for
daily or so Travis CI) should have some stricter limitations and structure.
But right now I feel humpered by it, and this is counterproductive.

So, we want freedom, responsibility and ownersheep of our tests. Please
give us the opportunity to get down on business and start writing tests and
start testing.

Yours,
Aleksandar
