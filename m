Fedora rawhide carries mingw64 v7.0.0, which was released in Nov 2019

The WHPX headers were added to mingw64 git a week later, so they're
not available in any distro yet. =


The mingw64 release schedule looks "sporadic" so maybe we can just
request a new release to make WPHX stuff available. It'll thus be
available for our CI in rawhide/sid shortly thereafter, which will
be the best solution to let us do this in GitLab.

We certainly don't want to add yet another separate CI system just
for WHPX.

Regards,
Daniel

Title:
  QEMU installer with WHPX support

Status in QEMU:
  Opinion

Bug description:
  People often ask the community to add WHPX support to the QEMU installer =
for Windows,
  but it is impossible due to the license limitations of the WHPX SDK.

  The WinHvEmulation.h and WinHvPlatform.h header files needed are "All
  rights reserved".

  However these headers only contain struct definitions and integer constan=
ts,
  no functional code in macros or inline functions. See:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg645815.html
  It is questionable whether the headers alone can be considered copyrighta=
ble material.
