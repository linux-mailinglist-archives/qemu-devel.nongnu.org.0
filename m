In general, I'm wary of making the amount of whitespace within a line
significant, but in this case, the visual misalignment of bar and baz
should make accidents unlikely.

How does

  @foo:  bar
         baz
  @frob: gnu
         gnat

behave?

This is something people may actually write.

Valid points.

Sounds like a good trade.

Yes, that's better.
