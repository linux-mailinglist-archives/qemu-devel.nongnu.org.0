Tried sending you a message @ginf, but haven't heard back from you so I'm p=
osting here instead;
What kind of debug trace do you want me to give you logs from?
$ /opt/qemu4/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -d help
Log items (comma separated):
out_asm         show generated host assembly code for each compiled TB
in_asm          show target assembly code for each compiled TB
op              show micro ops for each compiled TB
op_opt          show micro ops after optimization
op_ind          show micro ops before indirect lowering
int             show interrupts/exceptions in short format
exec            show trace before each executed TB (lots of logs)
cpu             show CPU registers before entering a TB (lots of logs)
fpu             include FPU registers in the 'cpu' logging
mmu             log MMU-related activities
pcall           x86 only: show protected mode far calls/returns/exceptions
cpu_reset       show CPU state before CPU resets
unimp           log unimplemented functionality
guest_errors    log when the guest OS does something invalid (eg accessing a
non-existent register)
page            dump pages at beginning of user mode emulation
nochain         do not chain compiled TBs so that "exec" and "cpu" show
complete traces
trace:PATTERN   enable trace events

Use "-d trace:help" to get a list of trace events.

Title:
  HDA device non functional in Windows 10 1903

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I made the update to 1903, and the HDA device stopped working.

  The driver says the device is working correctly, but it does not.
  When I try to open the Windows sound configuration, the dialog hangs and =
never shows it's content.

  Several people reported this back in May:

  https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-v1903-ich6-ich9-virtio/

  I can confirm I have exactly the same problem.

  Host is Arch Linux, current (5.2.5) kernel, QEMU 4.0.

  I enabled HDA debug output and compared an older, working Windows
  version to 1903, but could not see the difference. The driver seems to
  issue the same verbs.

  I am happy to provide additional information if needed.
