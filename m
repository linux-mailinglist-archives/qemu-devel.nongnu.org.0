IMHO we only need to make the code path efficient up to the point we
know we have an IO operation that contains sector(s) that we want to do
something with.  Once that happens I don't think it will be an issue for
those to be slower.  A real spinning disk drive takes longer to handle a
request when it encounters an error too.

It would only handle specific sector(s) of interest, not all.
