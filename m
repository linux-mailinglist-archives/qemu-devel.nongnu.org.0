Hmm. I'm not sure what you mean by either :-)

Is there any commonality between the vector drivers? I can't see how
that'd work without a bus abstraction (like virtio) in qemu? I mean, the
kernel driver just calls uml_vector_sendmmsg(), which I'd say belongs
more to the 'outside world', but that can't really be done in qemu?

Ok, I guess then I see what you mean by 'native' though.

Similarly, of course, I can implement arbitrary virt-io devices - just
the kernel side doesn't call a function like uml_vector_sendmmsg()
directly, but instead the virt-io model, and the model calls the
function, which essentially is the same just with a (convenient)
abstraction layer.

But this leaves the fundamental fact the model code ("vector_user.c" or
a similar "virtio_user.c") is still part of the build.

I guess what I'm thinking is have something like "virtio_user_rpc.c"
that uses some appropriate RPC to interact with the real model. IOW,
rather than having all the model-specific logic actually be here (like
vector_user.c actually knows how to send network packets over a real
socket fd), try to call out to some RPC that contains the real model.

Now that I thought about it further, I guess my question boils down to
"did anyone ever think about doing RPC for Virt-IO instead of putting
the entire device model into the hypervisor/emulator/...".
