So I spoke too soon.  This approach fixed the one thing that I was struggling with, but broke the rest, because it completely replicates the last image even when the source provides proper allocation data.  Best to show with an illustration:

  $ rm -f disk.img snap.img
  $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=disk.img bs=2M count=1
  $ dd if=/dev/zero of=snap.img bs=1M count=1
  $ truncate -s 2M snap.img
  $ qemu-img map --output=json snap.img
  [{ "start": 0, "length": 1048576, "depth": 0, "zero": false, "data": true, "offset": 0},
  { "start": 1048576, "length": 1048576, "depth": 0, "zero": true, "data": false, "offset": 1048576}]
  $ qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 disk.img disk.qcow2
  $ qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 -B disk.qcow2 snap.img snap.qcow2
  $ qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw snap.qcow2 output.raw
  $ hexdump -C output.raw
  00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
  *
  00200000

And qemu-img convert from qcow2 to raw is not broken

So it looks like either we add support for this specific feature in qemu-img or
we need to use our own client that does that.

Unless someone has other ideas, that is.
