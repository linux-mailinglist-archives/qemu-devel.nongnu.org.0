Not really, though I guess it's slightly better than plain .inc.
They're not header files...

But we don't really want to build all these files before building
all C sources. We just want to say "this .c file depends on these
.inc.c files" and then let the build tool figure it out, surely?

Is this hardcoded in Meson? That seems pretty suboptimal.

Do you mean that it just adds an extra implicit ordering constraint,
such that if we need to rebuild both files not in 'gen' and files
that are in 'gen' the 'gen' ones go first, or that Meson really
builds all the 'gen' files first? What happens when you edit a
.decode file? How much stuff gets rebuilt?

Can Meson handle "this .c file needs to be built from something else?".
Presumably so, that's a common pattern for flex/yacc type tools.
