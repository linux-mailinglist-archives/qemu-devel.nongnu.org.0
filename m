You may have to average over several runs to see if there is a
detectable change. It could be although there are more instructions
being executed it makes no practical difference to the execution because
the processor is just as efficient in scheduling the work to the
execution units.

You have to remember on modern processors the relationship between
instructions and the utilisation of the eventual ALUs is tenuous at
best. After everything has been converted to uOps and scheduled you
might be doing broadly the same calculations. Pipeline and cache stalls
are probably a more important metric here although I doubt figure much
in the very tight loop of the benchmark.

Excellent - keep up the good work ;-)
