It's python, so it doesn't get built. It's in ./scripts/qapi/. It is 
invoked by the build machinery to turn the files in ./qapi into C files 
that get built into QEMU.

Try "make check-qapi-schema" to see this stuff run and get tested.

Depends on what you want to actually try to do, what interests you, what 
your goals are, etc. Some of the various Python-related tasks that I am 
working on right now are laid out below.

Part one is now merged; parts 2-6 remain.

This part is done, or mostly done.

Still pending parts 2-6 of the QAPI cleanup.

Patches on list to do this.

Need to resurface old patches to do this. I have a draft that was sent 
to the list prior to 5.1, but haven't touched it since.

I started porting ./scripts/qmp very recently. It is based off of my 
python maintainer's branch.

Various half-finished drafts exist only on my computer for these.

I also have some very rough prototype work to create an asynchronous QMP 
client in python.
