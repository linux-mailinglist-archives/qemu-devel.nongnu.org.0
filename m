I'd call out 'Compression type' header extension by name, to make it
more obvious.  Is it an error if bit 3 is set but the compression header
is not present? Is it an error if the compression header is present but
bit 3 is not set?

Our earlier magic numbers were probably created as random numbers and
contain 8-bit values, to make them less likely to appear naturally in
other parts of the file and thus less likely to be misinterpreted.  But
that's not a requirement, and I see that you followed the lead of "DATA"
and created "CMPR" for yours.  Works for me :)

Could probably do a better job at describing when the header is optional
vs. mandatory.

Wording suggestion: A single compression type is applied to all
compressed disk clusters, with no way to change compression types per
cluster.

But is that a hard requirement? Since this is already an incompatible
feature extension, we could have a compression type that states that
each compressed cluster is self-describing via a 1-byte prefix (yes, it
means compression is not quite as dense, but probably not an issue).

Something like: in the image header, we have compression type 1 =3D zlib,=

compression type 2 =3D zstd, etc, each of which treat all compressed
clusters as-is with no further per-cluster headers. Or, in the image
header, we have compression type 255 =3D per-cluster, at which point a
compressed cluster is now represented as: [1-byte prefix] [tail], where
the one-byte prefix is 1 =3D zlib, 2 =3D zstd, etc (but not 255), and the=
n
the tail is decoded with the appropriate algorithm. In this way, it
might even be possible to encode different clusters with an optimal
algorithm per cluster, and thus create an image that requires both zlib
and zstd to be fully read.

I'm not sure if we need that much complexity, but just throwing it out
there for thought.

Here's where we have to think about back-compat. If zlib is used, and
the compression type header is present, must incompatible bit 3 be set?
Do we want to permit images that have incompatible bit 3 set and zlib
explicitly mentioned? Or are you making a hard requirement that if zlib
is chosen, incompatible bit 3 must be absent and no compression header
should be set? Or is it okay for the compression header to be present
and incompatible bit 3 clear, but only when compression type 0 is
chosen?  Let's spell out exactly what we want, probably with a goal of
minimizing the number of situations where an incompatible bit must be
set (as that makes it harder to work with images in older software).

Does the compression type really have to be chosen at image creation, or
can the decision be deferred until the time that the first compressed
cluster is written?  You could implement things to state that if
incompatible bit 3 is set but the compression header is absent, then
there must not be any compressed clusters in the image; as soon as the
first compressed cluster is written, then the compression header must
also be written (even if it explicitly calls out zlib), to make it
easier for new software to tell at a glance if the image has ever
contained compressed clusters at least once in the past.
