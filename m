Yeah, if we're not building the apache-2.0 parts then I think
we're OK, and as you say there's the question of whether QEMU's
GPL affects what we ship as mere bios blobs to run as guest
code anyway. But it's sufficiently not a "really obviously ok"
that I'd like a second opinion; cc'd some people who might have
second opinions.

I was thinking in the commit message. We also seem to
have human-readable information in pc-bios/README for
the various blobs, which seems to be a good place for a brief
one-para summary of what OpenSBI is, a URL for its upstream,
and a brief note of the license.

That would be Jeff or Stefan (cc'd).

Yeah, that would be my suggestion.
