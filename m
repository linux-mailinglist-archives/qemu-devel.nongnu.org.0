Yes, that comes back to the problem we've discussed previously about
how to determine the correct expected VMSA content which has no easy
answer.

Ok, so the usage scenario is that the platform owner is deciding 
which OVMF build in use, not the guest owner. That guest owner just
knows that it is an OVMF build from a set of builds published by the
platform owner. Good enough if you trust the cloud owner in general,
but want confidence that their compute host isn't compromised. Would
need  an independantly reproducible build, if you don't trust the
cloud owner at all.


Assuming we've got 5 possible OVMF builds, currently we would need
to calculate 5 HMACs over the inpuot data.

With this extra piece of info, we only need to calculate 1 HMAC.

So this is enabling a performance optimization, that could indeed
be used in a production deployment.  The HMAC ops are not exactly
performance intensive though until we get to the point of choosing
between a huge number of possible OVMFs.

If we can't get the VMSA info included, then the guest owner still
needs a local copy of every possible OVMF binary that is valid. IOW
this digest is essentially no more than a filename to identify which
OVMF binary to calc the HMAC over.

IOW, I think there's only two scenarios that make sense

1. The combined launch digest over firmware, kernel hashes
   and VMSA state.

2. Individual hashes for each of firmware, kernel hashes table and
   VMSA state

I think we should assume that anyone who has access to SEV-ES hardware
is likely to run in SEV-ES policy, not SEV policy. So without VMSA
state I think that (1) is of quite limited usefulness. (2) would
be nicer to allow optimization of picking which OVMF blob to use,
as you wouldn't need to figure out the cross-product of very valid
OVMF and every valid kernel hashes table - the latter probably isn't
even a finite bounded set.

Yeah its a shame we aren't just measuring the digest of each piece
of information in  GCTX.LD, instead of measuring the raw information
directly.


I wonder if we're thinking of this at the wrong level though. Does
it actually need to be QEMU providing this info to the guest owner ?

Guest owners aren't going to be interacting with QEMU / QMP directly,
nor are they likely to be interacting with libvirt directly. Their
way into the public cloud will be via some high level API. eg the
OpenStack Nova REST API, or the IBM Cloud API (whatever that may
be). This high level mgmt infra is likely what is deciding which
of the 'N' possible OVMF builds to pick for a given VM launch. It
could easily just expose the full OVMF data to the user via its
own API regardless of what query-sev does.

Similarly if the cloud is choosing which kernel, out of N possible
kernels to boot with, they could expose the raw kernel data somewhere
in their API - we don't neccessarily need to expose that from QEMU.

If we don't find a way to extract the VMSA data blob on the fly,
then the cloud owner will need to public VMSA data somewhere out
of band regardless.

Given we can't actually emit a valid GCTX.LD for SEV, my preference
would be to just report the hashes of each piece of data that is a
input to the GCTX.LD. eg report 'firmware-digest', 'kernel-digest',
'initrd-digest', 'cmdline-digest'.

They can use firmware-digest as a identifier to locate the raw
firmware data blob.

They can use kernel-digest, initrd-digest, and cmdline-digest to
compare against their list of expected kernel/initrd binaries, if
the cloud owner controls them, and also to then build the kernl
hashes table.

They still have to figure out the VMSAs separately somehow, or
the cloud mgmt layer can use all of this info to expose the
raw data in their own higher level API.
