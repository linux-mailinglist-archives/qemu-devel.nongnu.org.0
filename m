If we follow our deprecation policy, this shouldn't happen until
pc-*-4.3.  On pc-*-4.1 and pc-*-4.2, I expect "-cpu Haswell" to
stay runnable if it's already runnable with pc-*-4.0.  This will
give libvirt and other management software some time to adapt.

CPU model changes that don't affect runnability, though, are
already allowed and will still be allowed.

Exactly.

Yes.  Management software should see that "Haswell-NNN" has no
"alias-of" field, so it doesn't need to be changed.
