Hi Miklos,

Trying to understand your proposal. So if we want to do an ..xattr()
operation on a special file (and we don't have _at() variants), how
will fchdir() help. Are you suggesting fchdir() to parent and then
do something special.

Can you please elaborate your proposal a bit more. I think I have
missed the core idea completely.

I understand that you want to do unshare(CLONE_FS) to make sure one thrad's
fchdir() does not impact other thread. But did not understand that how
fchdir() alone is enough to do getxattr()/setxattr() on special file.

Thanks
Vivek
