Sometimes, 245 fails for me because some stream job has already finished
while the test expects it to still be active.  (With -c none, it fails
basically every time.) The most reliable way to fix this is to simply
set auto_finalize=3Dfalse so the job will remain in the block graph as
long as we need it.  This allows us to drop the rate limiting, too,
which makes the test faster.

The only problem with this is that there is a single place that yields a
different error message depending on whether the stream job is still
copying data (so COR is enabled) or not (COR has been disabled, but the
job still has the WRITE_UNCHANGED permission on the target node).  We
can easily address that by expecting either error message.

Note that we do not need auto_finalize=3Dfalse (or rate limiting) for the
active commit job, because It never completes without an explicit
block-job-complete anyway.
