Yep, plus I think the memory pinning and IOMMU resources could be a
variable as well.  Essentially, there's no guaranteed reservation to
the device or any of the additional resources that the device implies
once it's released, so we want to keep as much of that on hot-standby
as we can in case the migration fails.  Unfortunately even just
unmapping the BARs for a guest-only hot-unplug unmaps those regions
from the IOMMU, but aside from catastrophic resource issues on the
host, we can essentially guarantee being able to remap those.  Thanks,

Alex
