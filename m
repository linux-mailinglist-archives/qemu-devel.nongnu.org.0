Per our support build platform doc, the oldest distros we care about will
be RHEL-7 and Debian Jessie.  Except we can drop Jessie 2 years after
Stretch was released. IOW, we can drop Jessie in June this year, which
is before our next releasee. So we don't need to care about the 3.4
version in Jessie.

RHEL-7 doesn't have py3 at all in standard distros, but it can be obtained
via software collections and this has 3.6

Debian Strech has 3.5.3, so 3.5 looks like our min viable version.

Daniel
