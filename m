Title:
  default memory parameter too small on x86_64 today

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Launching a centos74 iso VM today does not work anymore on x86_64
  without increasing the size of the memory parameter. For example with
  this command :

  $ /opt/qemu-3.0.0/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 --curses   -enable-kvm -drive
  file=3Dfile.dd,index=3D0,media=3Ddisk -drive file=3Dcentos-
  x86_64.iso,index=3D1,media=3Dcdrom

  [    3.047614] Failed to execute /init
  [    3.048315] Kernel panic - not syncing: No init found.  Try passing in=
it=3D option to kernel. See Linux Documentation/init.txt for guidance.
  [    3.049258] CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 3.10.0-693.21.1.=
el7.x86

  Increasing the size from the default 128MiB to 512MiB let the VM works wi=
thout problem.
  So, ok, it's not a qemu problem, it's more a "User problem" and interface=
 problem for me.
  But it push me in the end to launch VirtualBox instead of qemu, because t=
he default parameter does not work anymore... And I had no time to investig=
ate why it does not work because the message is not visible.
  Debian iso with the same command line for example show a message to tell =
me that there is not enough memory, so it help me to track the real issue b=
ehind.

  But... In the end, I think today, the default memory parameter on x86_64 =
is too small and it can lead some people like me to switch to VirtualBox.
  VirtualBox, in the wizard is set by default to 4MiB Ram size, which tell =
you... Ok I need to put more. And, you know that 4MiB is not enough in the =
end.

  Regards,

  Johann
