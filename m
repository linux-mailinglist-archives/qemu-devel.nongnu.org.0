I'm fighting the symptoms, not the cause :-) My understanding is that
when SynIC is enabled for CPU0 KVM does

kvm_vcpu_update_apicv()
=09vmx_refresh_apicv_exec_ctrl()
=09=09pin_controls_set()

for *all* vCPUs (KVM_REQ_APICV_UPDATE). I'm not sure why
SECONDARY_EXEC_APIC_REGISTER_VIRT/SECONDARY_EXEC_VIRTUAL_INTR_DELIVERY
are not causing problems and only PIN_BASED_POSTED_INTR does as we clear
them all (not very important atm).

The KVM implementation will differ from what we've done to fix eVMCS. We
will either need to keep the controls on (and additionally check
kvm_vcpu_apicv_active() if guest tries to enable them) and again filter
VMX MSR reads from the guest or do the filtering on MSR write from
userspace (filter out the unsupported controls and not fail).

Actually, I'm starting to think it would've been easier to just filter
all VMX MSRs on KVM_SET_MSRS leaving only the supported controls and not
fail the operation. That way we would've fixed both eVMCS and SynIC
issues in a consistent way shifting the responsibility towards
userspace (document that VMX MSRs are 'special' and enabling certain
features may result in changes; if userspace wants to see the actual
state it may issue KVM_GET_MSRS any time) May not be the worst solution
after all...
