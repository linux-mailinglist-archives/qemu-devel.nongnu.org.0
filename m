Sure. But why are we setting the kvm_target at all for the
!kvm_enabled() case?

Hmm, I had been hoping there was a generic v8a one - kvm64.c kind of
got my hopes up with "arm,arm-v8". Still, for "max", would it not be
useful to update it to the track the most architecturally advanced cpu
supported? At this point "arm,cortex-a72".

Maybe I'm being too rigid in my thinking here, but it does kind of jar
to see code call a function called aarch64_a57_initfn to have it write
a value where it then throws away the only thing in the value that
made it a57.

I might start by doing that bit. It might make a lot of the above
niggles simply disappear.

Not entirely unrelated question:
Would you take added field definitions in target/arm/cpu.h for
features not yet emulated in QEMU but defined in released versions of
ARM ARM?
