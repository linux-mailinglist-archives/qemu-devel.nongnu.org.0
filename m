When patch series are accepted they are first pushed to the 'staging'
branch, which triggers a CI pipeline. If-and-only-if the pipeline
succeeds, the code is then pushed to the default branch. The latter
step triggers a second pipeline that duplicates what was just validated
in the 'staging' branch. This wastes CI resources and can delay jobs
needed by a subsequently pushed 'staging' branch.

This is particularly evident with jobs delegated to Cirrus CI where
there is very limited concurrency of jobs. The duplicate jobs in
'master' often delay the next 'staging' jobs enough to cause 1 hour
timeout to be hit.

There is similar wasted CI resource when release tags are pushed to
the repo, since the branch associated with the release will have
already passed CI.

For user forks is is reasonable to skip CI on the default branch since
that's either usually unused or follows the main repo default branch.
Meanwhile tags in user forks are typically used to track postings of
specific patch series versions. It is expected that a contributor
will have tested before sending the patch series. Thus pipelines for
the default branch and tag pushes in forks are redundant too.

This patch makes use of the 'workflow:' configuration to setup rules
that apply to the entire pipeline. The rules allow pipelines to be
created ONLY in response to:

 - Push events to a non-default branch
 - Scheduled pipelines
 - REST API pipeline triggers
 - Web UI pipeline triggers
