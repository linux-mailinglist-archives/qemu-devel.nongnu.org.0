Oh, I see, you're basically doing something like postcopy migration. I
was assuming it was more like regular live migration, except that you
would overwrite updated RAM blocks instead of appending them.

I can see your requirement then.

I guess I could imagine a different, though probably not better way: We
could internally have a separate low-level operation that moves the VM
state from the active layer to an already existing disk snapshot. Then
you would snapshot the disk and start writing the VM to the active
layer, and when the VM state write has completed you move it into the
snapshot.

The other options is doing what you suggested. There is nothing in the
qcow2 on-disk format that would prevent this, but we would have to
extend the qcow2 driver to allow I/O to inactive L1 tables. This sounds
like a non-trivial amount of code changes, though it would potentially
enable more use cases we never implemented ((read-only) access to
internal snapshots as block nodes, so you could e.g. use block jobs to
export a snapshot).
