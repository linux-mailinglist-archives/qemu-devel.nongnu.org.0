I does seem odd to me also.=20

I think a timeout takes place and that is why audio stops playing. It is =

I had completely forgot about MTTCG. I think Howard once did some =

this is another avenue we should look at.

Good point. MTTCG might be the option that really helps with speed =
improvements.=
