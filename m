I think it does so by pinning pages.  Is it acceptable that if the
vendor driver pins any pages, then from that point forward we consider
the IOMMU group dirty page scope to be limited to pinned pages?  There
are complications around non-singleton IOMMU groups, but I think we're
already leaning towards that being a non-worthwhile problem to solve.
So if we require that only singleton IOMMU groups can pin pages and we
pass the IOMMU group as a parameter to
vfio_iommu_driver_ops.pin_pages(), then the type1 backend can set a
flag on its local vfio_group struct to indicate dirty page scope is
limited to pinned pages.  We might want to keep a flag on the
vfio_iommu struct to indicate if all of the vfio_groups for each
vfio_domain in the vfio_iommu.domain_list dirty page scope limited to
pinned pages as an optimization to avoid walking lists too often.  Then
we could test if vfio_iommu.domain_list is not empty and this new flag
does not limit the dirty page scope, then everything within each
vfio_dma is considered dirty.

I'm not sure.  I thought I had an argument that the iova_pgsize could
indicate support for sizes smaller than the processor page size, which
would make the user responsible for using a different base for their
page size, but vfio_pgsize_bitmap() already masks out sub-page sizes.
Clearly the vendor driver is pinning based on processor sized pages,
but that's independent of an IOMMU and not part of a user ABI.

I'm tempted to say your bitmap_size field has a use here, but it seems
to fail in validating the user page size at the low extremes.  For
example if we have a single page mapping, the user can specify the iova
size as 4K (for example), but the minimum bitmap_size they can indicate
is 1 byte, would we therefore assume the user's bitmap page size is 512
bytes (ie. they provided us with 8 bits to describe a 4K range)?  We'd
need to be careful to specify that the minimum iova_pgsize indicated
page size is our lower bound as well.  But then what do we do if the
user provides us with a smaller buffer than we expect?  For example, a
128MB iova range and only an 8-byte buffer.  Do we go ahead and assume
a 2MB page size and fill the bitmap accordingly or do we generate an
error?  If the latter, might we support that at some point in time and
is it sufficient to let the user perform trial and error to test if that
exists?  Thanks,

Alex
