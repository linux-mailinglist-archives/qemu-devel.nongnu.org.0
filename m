The way your latest patches have it, with a separate read function,
works for me.

You could probably change libvhost-user to reimplement the same
functionality, and it might be an improvement for other users of the
library, but it's also code duplication and doesn't provide more value
in the context of the vhost-user export in QEMU.

The point that's really important to me is just that we never block when
we run inside QEMU because that would actually stall the guest. This
means busy waiting in a tight loop until read() returns enough bytes is
not acceptable in QEMU.
