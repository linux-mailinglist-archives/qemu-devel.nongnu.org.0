A bit of history.

QMP initially shared HMP's "schema": qemu-monitor.hx.  The command
handler was either a traditional HMP one, or a QMP-enabling pair (QMP
handler, HMP formatter).  The idea was to convert traditional HMP
handlers one by one, then ditch support for them.

With a QMP handler, HMP became a wrapper around QMP.  The input wrapping
was data-driven: @args_type specifies how to map HMP arguments to QMP.
The output wrapper was code, namely the HMP formatter.

This design turned out to tie QMP to HMP too tightly.  It assumes QMP
and HMP commands are identical apart from argument syntax and output
formatting.  They often should not be.  QMP wants building blocks:
simple commands with simple replies, in particular simple failure modes.
HMP wants convenience.  QMP wants rigor.  HMP has uses where that's a
painful and unnecessary.

So we split qemu-monitor.hx into hmp-commands.hx and qmp-commands.hx.
The former reverted back to the pre-QMP state, and the latter lost
support for HMP wrappers.  QMP was liberated from having to reimplement
HMP.  HMP was liberated from always having to do QMP first.

qmp-commands.hx was eventually replaced by the QAPI schema.

The lesson here is that to make "powered by a single root schema" work
well, we'll likely have to put in more smarts than we did back then.

More on that below in reply to David's reply.

Designing interfaces to complex machinery is hard.  Experience tells
that we do okay when we focus on the building blocks first.  That's
-blockdev.  When we start with trying to make simple things simple, we
end in swamps.  That's -drive.

Focus on building blocks is of course no excuse for unnecessary
hairiness.

It's also no reason not to build more convenient things on top of the
building blocks.  I doubt they should go into QMP, though.

In particular, we currently use HMP for debugging and monitoring
purposes, where we don't need or want QMP's rigor, neither its rigorous
interface stability, nor its structured I/O.  We want the "whipuptitude"
we get from monitor_printf().  This is actually a point David has made
several times.

To have a qmp-shell replace HMP, I think it needs to be able to

* Go beyond 1:1

  We tried a 1:1 mapping between HMP and QMP commands, and it didn't
  work out.  HMP's replacement should let us build convenient commands
  from QMP building blocks.

  We tried a 1:1 mapping between HMP and QMP command arguments, guided
  by @args_type.  Worked out for simple cases, but was too constricting.

* Preserve "whipuptitude" [David]

  I figure that means allowing some in QMP.  Without compromising its
  core mission, of course.

* As discoverable as HMP is now [Kevin]

* Help, completion and such at least on par with what HMP provides now

Highly desirable:

* Support transitioning to the machine interface [John]

  Let humans start playing with the human interface, and when they feel
  the need to automate, help them transition to QMP.

Back to John's question on qmp-shell syntax, which hasn't been answered
so far.

JSON is a data-interchange format.  It doesn't try to be a configuration
format or programming language syntax for human use.  It gets pressed
into these roles with entirely predictable poor results.

Pain points of JSON include having to count parenthesises and having to
quote so bloody much.  Additional QMP pain points include long names and
excessive nesting.

For the configuration format role, more usable alternatives exist.  YAML
is a popular one.

qmp-shell is a REPL.  It needs a REPL-friendly syntax.  I doubt YAML is
or even tries to be REPL-friendly.  I'd love to be wrong; the first rule
of language design is "don't".

Other language suggestions?

On making JSON suck less in this role:

LISP REPLs demonstrate that computers can assist effectively with
counting parenthesises, and with completing long names.

We could make quoting optional for sufficiently nice object member
names.  QAPI naming rules ensure niceness, actually.

We could make quoting optional for certain string literals.  Simple
enough for literals that can only be a string, like abc.  For literals
that could be something else like 123 or true, omitting quotes creates
ambiguity.  When the schema accepts only one of the possible types, the
ambiguity goes away.  Complexity stays, however.

Excessive nesting should ideally be attacked in QMP itself, but backward
compatibility makes that hard.
