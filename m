As it is for most platforms, but still, the values of machine
properties are available to you at this point.

Ah, yes, I see your point.  So my current suggestion will satisfy
that, basically it is:

cpu has unpack (inc. by default) && htl specified
	=3D> works (allowing secure), as expected

!cpu has unpack && htl specified
	=3D> bails out with an error

!cpu has unpack && !htl specified
	=3D> works for a non-secure guest, as expected
	=3D> guest will fail if it attempts to go secure

cpu has unpack && !htl specified
	=3D> works as expected for a non-secure guest (unpack feature is
	   present, but unused)
	=3D> secure guest may work "by accident", but only if all virtio
	   properties have the right values, which is the user's
	   problem

That last case is kinda ugly, but I think it's tolerable.
