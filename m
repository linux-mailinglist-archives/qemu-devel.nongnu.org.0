I've only tested EDID with MacOS with an NDRV from an ATI card ROM and 
MorphOS on mac99. These could read EDID with this patch. Haven't tried 
RV100 as that's known to be very incomplete to work yet (probably needs at 
least command FIFO to do something). The rage128 Xorg driver might load 
but that wants to use VESA BIOS function mentioned in the commit message 
to read EDID so it does not work yet. If you can add that function to 
vesabios it might get further.

This bit is listed as mask bit in docs and clients set this to enable 
other bits. It could probably safely be ignored (does not seem to be 
present on RV100 only on older card) but checking it does not hurt either.

No because there could be all kinds of unalligned or multibyte access and 
we only want to trigger this when the byte with the enable bits are 
touched. (The MacOS NDRV accesses this 1 byte at a time so this is needed 
to avoid spurious i2c bit banging but other drivers write 4 bytes so then 
addr is not equal but covering above byte which is what this test allows.

They are in a different register and drivers I've tried poke bits shifted 
by one on R128P.
