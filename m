I'm not sure it deserves a new top level for such a specific tool.

Form virtiofsd's point of view I'm not that worried about the release
cycle;  Given that features have to go through virtio standardisation,
the release ycle is unlikely to be a bottleneck.

As a qemu contributor, your opinion is welcome!  No need to sit on the
fence.
