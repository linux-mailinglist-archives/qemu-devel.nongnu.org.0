Thank you very much! This makes tinging about 'on/off/auto' much easier.

I will whip up a prototype first and then come back to you with more
details.

The short answer is if the user isn't very careful about all the whistles
and bells, I understand that the user will end up with a partially or
fully non-PV-compatible VM.

I had an internal bugreport where there was a nic generated by default
that of course did not have iommu_platform=3D'on'.

>=20

I fully agree! This is unfortunately currently not the case. My patch
takes the approach of avoiding miss-configuration in the first place,
instead of sapping the user for it.

Janosch has answered these. Will add my thoughts there.

Sorry, where exactly would you like to have those extra comments?

If I have to settle for yes or no, my answer is no.

We need at least one subsystem reset during the conversion. Without
my patch applied things look like this

Which does a qemu_devices_reset(), we already have a subsystem_reset(),
but for the cases with a PV transition this reset happens before mc->pv
is changed, so I can't react properly in the callback. For my purposes
the qemu_devices_reset() is sufficient, but I'm not sure.

The qemu_devices_reset() seems to come form db3b2566e0 ("s390x: machine
reset function with new ipl cpu handling") authored by David and reviewed by
you.

The subsystem reset from 4e872a3fb0 ("s390: provide I/O subsystem
reset") authored by Christian.

=46rom I quick look, I believe what is done by subsystem_reset() should
be a real subset of what is done by qemu_devices_reset().

Maybe the subsystem_reset() can be just moved and the extra
subsystem_reset() calls added by me can be removed. I didn't look into
that, because it would have been wasted effort if the community rejects this
approach.

I hope this answers your questions!

Thanks for having a look!

Regards,
Halil
