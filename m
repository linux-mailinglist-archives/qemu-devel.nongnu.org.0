im not sure i agree with that.
standardising a filesystem based api that is used across all vendors is also a valid
option.  that said if devlink is the right choice form a kerenl perspective by all
means use it but i have not heard a convincing argument for why it actually better.
with tthat said we have been uing tools like ethtool to manage aspect of nics for decades
so its not that strange an idea to use a tool and binary protocoal rather then a text
based interface for this but there are advantages to both approches.

and devlink python libs if openstack was to use it directly.
we do have caes where we just frok a process and execaute a comannd in a shell
with or without elevated privladge but we really dont like doing that due to 
the performacne impacat and security implciations so where we can use python bindign
over c apis we do. pyroute2 is the only python lib i know off of the top of my head
that support devlink so we would need to enhacne it to support this new devlink api.
there may be otherss i have not really looked in the past since we dont need to use
devlink at all today.

i dont think we would use direct devlink monitoring in nova even if it was avaiable.
we could but we already poll libvirt and the system for other resouce periodicly.
we likely wouldl just add monitoriv via devlink to that periodic task.
we certenly would not use it to detect a migration or a need to update a migration database(not sure what that is)

in reality if we can consume this info indirectly via a libvirt api that will
be the appcoh we will take at least for the libvirt driver in nova. for cyborg
they may take a different appoch. we already use pyroute2 in 2 projects, os-vif and
neutron and it does have devlink support so the burden of using devlink is not that
high for openstack but its a less frineadly interface for configuration tools like
ansiable vs a filesystem based approch.
