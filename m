Yep something to check, seems unnecessary.

Ok, I'd still keep also a comment with the code, as it's read more than commit logs, at the minimum a: "this is NULL when TCG code is not available".

You are right, the comment is obsolete.

This is a leftover comment from when I thought that there was no way to remove the last place where the tcg ops where changed in arm,
which was the part I removed here:

@@ -805,10 +808,6 @@ static void aarch64_cpu_class_init(ObjectClass *oc, void *data)

     CPUClass *cc = CPU_CLASS(oc);
 
-#ifdef CONFIG_TCG
-    cc->tcg_ops.cpu_exec_interrupt = arm_cpu_exec_interrupt;
-#endif /* CONFIG_TCG */
-


I then figured out that this code was completely unnecessary.

Yes, I really wanted to do this.
Mips is the only blocker left that I can remember.

Yep, the ARM claim was true when I started looking at this, but now it's not anymore after the changes.

However, I haven't found a way to remove the mips jazz hack.

Maybe Philippe knows?
