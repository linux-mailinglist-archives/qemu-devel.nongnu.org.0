The protocol relies on both file descriptor and memory mapping. These
are hard to achieve with networking.

I think the closest would be using RDMA to accelerate memory access and
switching to a network notification mechanism instead of eventfd.

Sooner or later someone will probably try this. I don't think it makes
sense to define this transport in detail now if there are no users, but
we should try to make it possible to add it in the future, if necessary.

Another use case that is interesting and not yet directly addressed is:
how can another VM play the role of the device? This is important in
compute cloud environments where everything is a VM and running a
process on the host is not possible.

The virtio-vhost-user prototype showed that it's possible to add this on
top of an existing vhost-user style protocol by terminating the
connection in the device VMM and then communicating with the device
using a new VIRTIO device. Maybe that's the way to do it here too and we
don't need to worry about explicitly designing that into the vfio-user
protocol, but if anyone has other approaches in mind then let's discuss
them now.

Finally, I think the goal of integrating this new protocol into the
existing vfio component of VMMs is a good idea. Sticking closely to the
<linux/vfio.h> interface will help in this regard. The further away we
get, the harder it will be to fit it into the vfio code in existing VMMs
and the harder it will be for users to configure the VMM along the lines
for how vfio works today.
