In kernel I would use READ_ONCE. 

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.8-rc1/source/include/asm-generic/atomic.h#L171

In this case we are not manipulating an atomic variable. For uint8_t
that boils down to an access through a volatile pointer. And that is
what I did :).

IMHO what we want here is READ_ONCE, i.e. volatile access, and not
necessarily atomic access. But I suppose atomic access implies volatile
access (the C11 standard refers to atomic_load as 
C atomic_load(volatile A *object)). Because QEMU seems to use atomic_read()
in such situations, and does not have READ_ONCE, for me atomic_read would
also do.
