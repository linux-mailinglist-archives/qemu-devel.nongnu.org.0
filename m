I definitely want to continue at least having the opprotunity to review,
though you may have noticed I am a bit low on time for more thorough
maintenance this project deserves. The recent development pace for nvme
would benefit from having its own tree, so I'm open to either
co-maintenance, or handing off this to others. Please allow me to send a
few queries off-list today to check-in with potentially interested parties.
