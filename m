Yeah, but production QEMU is out there in the world based on
the old DT binding documentation. So you can't unilaterally
make a part of the binding that wasn't documented and that QEMU
didn't emit mandatory. It might be preferable for new QEMU to
emit it, of course.

This is just saying "the yaml says these things are mandatory".
You could equally get rid of them by marking them optional in
the yaml, right?

Also, complaining about the nodename seems like a bug in the
validation: it is not a mandatory part of the spec, just a
recommendation.

By that logic the PL011 UART is an interrupt controller, because
it can assert its interrupt output based on activity on the serial
port input lines.

A GPIO controller is not an interrupt controller inherently.
Maybe you can use it in a system design as an interrupt
controller if you want to, and in that system's dtb perhaps
it would make sense to label it as one, but the virt board's
PL061 is in no way an interrupt controller -- it's just a GPIO
controller.

OK. But why would we want to run an interrupt line through the GPIO
controller when we have a perfectly good interrupt controller in
the system already?

It might be reasonable to add the properties now to avoid setting
a bear trap for ourselves in future; on the other hand if running
interrupt lines through the GPIO controller doesn't work then it
acts as a nudge to stop people adding devices that are wired
up in a weird way.

OK, then we don't need to change the node name here. Lots
of the other devices on the virt board have node names that
happen to use the device name rather than being more generic.
