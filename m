Ok, I'll drop P9_IOHDRSZ completely and mention literal 7 as absolute 
theoretical minimum instead.

Individual entries are not truncated, correct, but data loss: Example, you 
have this directory and say server's fs would deliver entries by readdir() in 
this order (from top down):

	.
	..
	a
	1234567890
	b
	c
	d

and say 37 >= msize < 45, then client would receive 3 entries ".", "..", "a" 
and that's it.

1. Like done in this patch series: Treaddir has to limit client's 'count'
   parameter according to msize (by subtracting with msize).

2. get_iounit() does this:

		iounit = stbuf.f_bsize;
		iounit *= (s->msize - P9_IOHDRSZ) / stbuf.f_bsize;

   without checking anywhere for a potential negative outcome
   (i.e. when msize < P9_IOHDRSZ)

3. Example of directory entry name length with Rreaddir above.

Individual issues that can easily be overlooked but also easily avoided by not 
allowing small msizes in the first place.
