Agree. Though the papr spec doesnt provide any upper bound on number of
stats that can be requested, I think a hard cap can be 255 which is the
max number of stats that a 4K page can hold.

But that verification is already being done in
scm_perf_check_rr_buffer() as part of header check. In case the provided
buffer is less than sizeof(perfstats) than address_space_read() would
fail or susequently  scm_perf_check_rr_buffer() would return an error.

'SCM_STATS_MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER' is the minimum size of output buffer
needed to hold all the supported nvdimm stats. A guest can always send a
buffer sized larger than 'SCM_STATS_MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER' where single stat
is requested more than once. In such a case 'bufferSizeInBytes'
(args[2]) received from guest which is a uint64 can be large.

review comment to self: add check for memory allocation failure

Dont want to return noopstat to the guest. 'nvdimm_perf_stat' will
always start with a noopstat descriptor hence want to skip that.

Right, thanks for pointin it out. This lingered from an earlier version
of the patch and I will get it removed.

Thanks, will implement something similar in next iteration.

Agree as mentioned earlier. Will remove this in next iteration of this
patch.

Sure can do that. Was trying to update qemu rr-buffer at a single
point rather than scattering updates to it at multiple places.

Agree. Thanks for the suggestion. Will add this in next iteration.
