We can only pin pages that the user has already allocated* and mapped
through the vfio DMA API.  The pinning of the page simply locks the
page for the vendor driver to access it and unpinning that page only
indicates that access is complete.  Pages are not freed when a vendor
driver unpins them, they still exist and at this point we're now
assuming the device dirtied the page while it was pinned.  Thanks,

Alex

* An exception here is that the page might be demand allocated and the
  act of pinning the page could actually allocate the backing page for
  the user if they have not faulted the page to trigger that allocation
  previously.  That page remains mapped for the user's virtual address
  space even after the unpinning though.
