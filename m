That's true if you're emulating a whole system complete with
hypervisor under TCG, which is what the "pnv" machine type does.

However, a more common use of qemu is the "pseries" machine type,
which emulates only a guest (in the cpu architectural sense) with qemu
taking the place of the hypervisor as well as emulating the cpus.  In
that case the H_CONFER hypercall goes to qemu.

Right, but with the "pseries" machine type qemu *is* the hypervisor.
