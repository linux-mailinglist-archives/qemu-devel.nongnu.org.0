I agree that what I'm doing here isn't a one rule fits all situation. This
is why I didn't purge all the 'unused' labels I found. The criteria used to
remove/spare labels will differ from person to person (although I believe that
cases such as patch 15 isn't too much of a debate), thus I'd rather leave to
each maintainer to accept/deny the changes based on the context of the code.

And for this same reason I don't think that a checkpatch rule is necessary.
The review process can take care of these situations and allow 'good unneeded
labels' to be in the code.


Thanks,


DHB
