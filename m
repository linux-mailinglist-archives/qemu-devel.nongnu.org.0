@keith, please see below - can you comment on the Linux kernel 2 MB
boundary requirement for the CMB? Or should we hail Stephen (or Logan
maybe) since this seems to be related to p2pdma?

Hi Andrzej,

Thanks for looking into this. I think your analysis helped me nail this.
The problem is that we added the use of a subregion and have some
assumptions that no longer hold.

nvme_addr_is_cmb() assumes that n->ctrl_mem.addr is an absolute address.
But when the memory region is a subregion, addr holds an offset into the
parent container instead. Thus, changing all occurances of
n->ctrl_mem.addr to (n->bar0.addr + n->ctrl_mem.addr) fixes the issue
(this is required in nvme_addr_is_cmb and nvme_map_prp). I patched that
in your original patch[1]. The reason my version worked is because there
was no subregion involved for the CMB, so the existing address
validation calculations were still correct.

This leaves us with the Linux kernel complaining about not being able to
register the CMB if it is not on a 2MB boundary - this is probably just
a constraint in the kernel that we can't do anything about (but I'm no
kernel hacker...), which can be fixed by either being "nice" towards the
Linux kernel by forcing a 2 MB alignment in the device or exposing the
SZU field such that the user can choose 16MiB size units (or higher)
instead of 1MiB. I'm leaning towards ensuring the 2 MB alignment in the
device such that we do not have to introduce new cmb_size parameters,
while also making it easier for the user to configure. But I'm not
really sure.
