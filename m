If page is unpinned, then that page is available in free page pool for 
others to use, then how can we say that unpinned page has valid data?

If suppose, one driver A unpins a page and when driver B of some other 
device gets that page and he pins it, uses it, and then unpins it, then 
how can we say that page has valid data for driver A?

Can you give one example where unpinned page data is considered reliable 
and valid?

Thanks,
Kirti
