Yes, I see that - however...

I'm just comparing the behaviour with a real FTDI adapter: if I plug it in, it's
always visible on the guest USB regardless as to whether there is a cable attached -
the line status is returned as it is seen on the wire. Whether the guest OS has a
concept as to whether a cable is attached is something that is internal to the
driver, and completely separate from QEMU's notion as to whether a chardev is attached.

For someone who has a reasonable amount of QEMU development experience I was just
surprised that I ended up having to going through the source code to understand why
my usb-serial device wasn't appearing in the guest. Certainly there is no mention of
this requirement in the QEMU documentation.

Something else I noticed was that this behaviour is unique to USB: in-built serial
ports behave exactly as I described above which matches the real FTDI USB hardware.
And another question: if this behaviour is acceptable for USB, should it not be the
same for other hotplug buses, e.g. should a PCIe serial card plugged into a PCIe bus
plug and unplug itself as the chardev is attached/detached in a similar way?


ATB,

Mark.
