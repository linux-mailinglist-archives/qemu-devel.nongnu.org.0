Title:
  Implement TPM2 configuration for emulators that provide TCP interface

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  swtpm provides several interfaces for its emulated device: unix socket
  (can be used by qemu), chardev. swtpm also provides TCP interface for
  the device which is very convenient for testing as it does not require
  root permissions.

  It would be very useful to have QEMU to work with TPM devices emulated
  via TCP.
