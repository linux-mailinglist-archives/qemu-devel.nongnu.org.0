While we're talking about unintuitive, I feel the result for
implied=3Dtrue is confusing, too. Never noticed it before, but are we
really sure that it is the best possible behaviour that '-chardev help'
and '-chardev id=3Dfoo,help' print two entirely different help texts?

I'm not requesting to change anything about this in this series, but
just making the point that maybe sometimes the existing behaviour is
questionable.

Shouldn't we also consider what users would reasonably expect?

Getting it parsed as an empty option name (I assume with a default value
of "on"?) certainly looks like something that would surprise most users
and, as you can see, even some QEMU developers.
