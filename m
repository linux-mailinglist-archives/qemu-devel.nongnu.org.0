Libvirt runs the qemu bridge helper command directly, and we have
applications using this functionality.

I'd like libvirt to be able to avoid use of the QEMU bridge helper and
instead have unprivileged libvirt talk to privileged libvirtd to open a
TAP fd on its behalf. If we ever get that done, then libvirt would not
need the qemu bridge helper command anymore.
