Hi David,

that approach (recursing the same way, just building libfdt instead of all) is what I tried first,
however as showcased above the libfdt target seems to cause more stuff to be built than necessary.

Do you think we should change the external module to make the minimal build of libfdt work, instead of removing the recursion?

Thanks,

Claudio
