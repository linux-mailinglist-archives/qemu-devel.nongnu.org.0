It seems I rejoiced too soon.

When we read the command data register in the last step, that is at
offset 0x8 in the register block. Considering the legacy "CPU present
bitmap", if no CPU is present in that range, then the firmware could
read a zero value. I got confused because I thought we were reading at
offset 0, which would always have bit0 set (for CPU#0).

Can we detect the modern interface like this:

1. store 0x0 to selector register (attempt to switch)
2. read one byte at offset 0 in the register block
3. if bit#0 is set, the modern interface is unavailable;
   otherwise (=3D bit#0 clear), the modern interface is available

Here's why:

- if even the legacy interface is missing, then step 2 is an unassigned
  read, hence the value read is all-bits-one; bit#0 is set

- if only the legacy interface is available, then bit#0 stands for
  CPU#0, it will be set

- if the switch-over in step 1 is successful, then offset 0 is reserved,
  hence it returns all-bits-zero.

With this, if we ever assigned offset 0 for reading, then we'd have to
define it with bit#0 constantly clear.

Thanks,
Laszlo
