Using the audiodev id is not a good idea. If you have multiple QEMU's
on your host, it is highly likely that libvirt will have assigned
the same audiodev id to all of them.  Using the vm name would be ok,
but only if you assume that each gust only has a single audio device.

Using a combination of vm name + audidev id is going to be unique
per host, but not especially friendly as a user visible name. It
would be ok as a default, but I'd think we should let the mgmt app
specify stream name explicitly, so that something user friendly
can be set.
