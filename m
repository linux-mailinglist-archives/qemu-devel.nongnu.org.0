Initially as you said to wire Python C API it needs study and care, but
once the framework reach to a stability we can use it for easy scripting
using it seamlessly.

if we can keep it conditional during configure, so that by default qemu
binary will not depend on libpython. If user needs to use this feature
then python 3 based libpython and python-config are necessary.

yes, hope that community will find its usefulness as it helped us to
test, study behavior of firmware/kernel and find bugs that is hard
to find otherwise.

Agreed that it would need proper documentation and active maintainer.
