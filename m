Right, this is a problem for sysbus, isa seems to not have this problem
though.

I suspect fully generic is tricky, also because you have to get the
hierarchy right.  For isa I think it is doable without too much trouble
because all isa devices are within the same scope.

sysbus is more tricky I suspect.

Well, I'd try to avoid the helper data structure indirection ...

I suspect the reason for the registry on arm is that you can generate
both acpi and device tree from it.  But maybe that makes sense for
sysbus devices (fw_cfg + virtio-mmio for microvm).

cheers,
