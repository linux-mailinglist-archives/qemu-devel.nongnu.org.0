Yes, I did overlook the fact that scsi-block is kind of hybrid passthough device,
doing SG_IO for some things and regular IO for others.

I don't think that my approach was wrong way to fix the problem, but as you found
out, abusing 'bs->sg' hack (which I would be very happy to remove completely)
wasn't a good idea.
I actualy was aware of scsi-block and that it does SG_IO but it 
was forgotten some where on the way.

So in summary what the problem is and what I think is the right solution:


Each qemu block driver exposes block limits and assumes that they are the same 
for two IO interfaces the block driver can expose:

1. Regular qemu blk_pread/pwrite alike functions
2. blk_ioctl (tiny wrapper against SG_IO), supported by posix-raw on 
   host block devices/sg char devices, and by iscsi

The problem is that these two interfaces can have different block limits.

I don't know about iscsi, but for files, doing regular IO is always unlimited,
since it passes through the kernel block layer and segemented there on 
demand which is faster that doing it in userspace, while SG_IO is passed as is
to the underlying SCSI device and lacks this segmentation.

Regardless of how NBD uses these limits, I think that these limits should be correctly
exposed by the block drivers, and therefore I propose is that each qemu block driver 
would expose a pair of block limits.
One for the regular block IO, and other for SG_IO.

Then block driver clients (like scsi devices that you mention, nbd, etc) 
can choose which limit to use, depending on which IO api they use.
The scsi-generic, and scsi-block can use the SG_IO limits, 
while the rest  can use the normal (unlimited for file I/O) limits, including the NBD.
