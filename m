I don't think we should need to worry about this state, because migration
will do its own save/restore of the virtual counter, and as that restore
comes later, it'll take precedence. We still need this state for the usual
save/restore when not migrating, though, because KVM_REG_ARM_TIMER_CNT is
a non-runtime cpreg with its level set to KVM_PUT_FULL_STATE.

It will, but only when level =3D=3D KVM_PUT_FULL_STATE.

Actually it doesn't really matter which takes precedence (I don't think),
which is why we can rely on the usual save/restore for migration. We only
need the new state this patch adds because we don't have any recent state
otherwise, and because then we can be selective and only do the
save/restore when transitioning to/from paused state.

Thanks,
