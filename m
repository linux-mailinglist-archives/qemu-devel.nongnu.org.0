That suggests your host OS hasn't got the new microcode installed
or has not loaded it.

You want the host to report that it is Mitigated, and for the
host's /proc/cpuinfo to report "md-clear" exists.

> I expected the guest can use the new microcode.

You've not said what CPU model you've given to the guest.

You need either "-cpu host", or if using a named CPU model
you need to explicitly turn on the "md-clear" feature
(and all previous fixes)

   eg  "-cpu Haswell,+spec-ctrl,+ssbd,+md-clear"

Daniel
