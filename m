Have you considered using Linux namespaces?  I'm beginning to think that
SELinux becomes less relevant with pid and mount namespaces to isolate
processes.  The advantage of namespaces is that they are easy to
understand and can be expressed in code instead of a policy file in a
separate package.  This is the approach we're taking with virtiofsd
(vhost-user device backend for virtio-fs).

Hard to reach a conclusion without also looking at CPU utilization.
IOPS alone don't tell the story.

If the system had spare CPU cycles then the performance results between
built-in LSI and separate LSI will be similar but the efficiency
(IOPS/CPU%) has actually decreased due to the extra CPU cycles required
to forward the hardware register access to the device emulation process.

If you rerun on a system without spare CPU cycles then IOPS degradation
would become apparent.  I'm not saying this is necessarily the case,
maybe the overhead is really doesn't have a significant effect, but the
graph shown in the blog post isn't enough to draw a conclusion either
way.

Regarding the proposed QEMU bypass, these already exist in some form via
kvm.ko's ioeventfd and coalesced MMIO features.

Today ioeventfd is only used for performance-critical hardware
registers, so kvm.ko doesn't use a sophisticated dispatch mechanism.  If
you want to use it for all hardware register accesses handled by a
separate process then ioeventfd probably needs to be tweaked somewhat to
make it more scalable for that case.

Coalesced MMIO is also cool.  kvm.ko can accumulate guest MMIO writes in
a buffer that is only collected at a later point in time.  This improves
performance for devices that require multiple hardware register writes
to kick off an I/O operation (only the last one really needs to be
trapped by the device emulation code!).  This sounds similar to an MMIO
access shared ring buffer.

Are you aware of any cases where the syscall attack surface led to an
exploitable bug in QEMU?  Any proof-of-concept exploit code or a CVE?

Debugging is a lot easier with a coredump though :).  I would rather
have a coredump than a nice message that says "LSI died".

I don't follow, to me this proposal seems extremely invasive and
requires awareness from all developers.

QEMU contains global state (like net/net.c:net_clients or
block.c:all_bdrv_states) and QMP commands that access global state.  All
of this needs to be carefully proxied to avoid losing functionality as
fundamental as the QMP monitor.

This is what worries me about this project.  There are amazing niche
features like record/replay that have been integrated into QEMU without
requiring all developers to be aware of how they work.  If you can
achieve this then I would have no reservations.

Right now I don't see that this will be possible and that's why I'm
challenging you to justify that the reduction in system call attack
surface is actually worth the invasive changes required.

Do you see a way to solve the issues I've mentioned?
