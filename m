Once QEMU can do the former, providing the latter should be trivial.
Not providing it would be unadvisable.

Yes, a management application that talks QMP anyway can be expected to
be quite happy with having to do initial configuration via QMP, with or
without a load-config command.

But human users won't be happy.  Having to use a wrapper program to feed
their configuration file to QMP adds undue complexity.
