Actually I've just realised that the conversion to qdev solves all these issues,
because qdev has the concept of connecting outputs to inputs. The way to do this is
to define the VIA(PCI)IDEState with an array of two name legacy IRQs (as detailed in
my previous email), plus the PCI IRQ.

Then all via_ide_set_irq() has to do is set each qdev gpio level accordingly; if a
board isn't interested in an IRQ it just doesn't wire it up. The final piece of the
puzzle is what do we do in PCI native mode, but that is simple: always drive the
legacy IRQs if there is no PCI IRQ connected.
