That was my understanding as well.

This use-case is out of the scope of virtio-video. Initially I had a plan to 
support capture-only streams like camera as well, but later the decision was 
made upstream that camera should be implemented as separate device type. We 
still plan to implement a simple frame capture capability as a downstream 
patch though.

We do support this in our device implementation. But spec in general has no 
requirements or instructions regarding this. And it is in fact flexible enough 
to provide abstraction on top of several HW devices.

Regarding the cameras, unfortunately same as above.

Best regards,
Dmitry.
