I agree but it's something we cannot address until the reset propagation
is hard-coded to be qdev/qbus based.

I was thinking of doing a work-around by defining the raspi machine
reset to something like that.

static void raspi_reset(MachineState *machine)
{
    SDBus *sdhci, *sdhost, *sdbus;
    /*
     * anticipate following reset and ensure the sd-card at its
     * end-of-reset place
     */
    sdhci =3D object_resolve_path("/path/to/sdhci");
    sdhost =3D object_resolve_path("/path/to/sdhost");
    sdbus =3D object_resolve_path("/path/to/sdbus");
    sdbus_reparent_card(sdbus, sdhci); // no-op if card is not on sdbus
    sdbus_reparent_card(sdhost, sdhci); //no-op if card is not on sdhost

    /* standard reset */
    qemu_devices_reset();
}
