Well, some of them will be (eg the s390 box), but some of them
are my personal ones that can't be reused easily. I'd assumed
in any case that gitlab would have at least support for x86 hosts:
we are definitely not going to continue to use my desktop machine
for running CI builds! Also IIRC RedHat said they'd be able to
provide some machines for runners.

I think we should start by getting the gitlab setup working
for the basic "x86 configs" first. Then we can try adding
a runner for s390 (that one's logistically easiest because
it is a project machine, not one owned by me personally or
by Linaro) once the basic framework is working, and expand
from there.

But to a large degree I really don't want to have to get
into the details of how gitlab works or setting up runners
myself if I can avoid it. We're going through this migration
because I want to be able to hand off the CI stuff to other
people, not to retain control of it.

thanks
