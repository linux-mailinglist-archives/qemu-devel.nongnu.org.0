Note: as per the recent discussions, the ACPI description is currently
allowed to changed and this is not really versionned. Normally this
should not really impact the guest but who knows?

NVDIMMs
- an MSI controller (GICv2M or ITS). GICv2M is selected by default along
with GICv2. ITS is selected by default with GICv3 (>= virt-2.7). Note
ITS is not modeled in TCG mode.
