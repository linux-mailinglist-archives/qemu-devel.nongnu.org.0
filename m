I think I've mentioned before, 9p virtfs supports different modes,
passthrough, squashed or remapped.

passthrough should be reasonably straightforward to support in virtiofs.
The guest sees all the host UID/GIDs ownership as normal, and can read
any files the host user can read, but are obviously restricted to write
to only the files that host user can write too. No DAC-OVERRIDE facility
in essence. You'll just get EPERM, which is fine. This simple passthrough
scenario would be just what's desired for a typical desktop virt use
cases, where you want to share part/all of your home dir with a guest for
easy file access. Personally this is the mode I'd be most interested in
seeing provided for unprivileged virtiofsd usage.

squash is similar to passthrough, except the guest sees everything
as owned by the same user. This can be surprising as the guest might
see a file owned by them, but not be able to write to it, as on the
host its actually owned by some other user. Fairly niche use case
I think.

remapping would be needed for a more general purpose use cases
allowing the guest to do arbitrary UID/GID changes, but on the host
everything is still stored as one user and remapped somehow.

The main challenge for all the unprivileged scenarios is safety of
the sandbox, to avoid risk of guests escaping to access files outside
of the exported dir via symlink attacks or similar.

Daniel
