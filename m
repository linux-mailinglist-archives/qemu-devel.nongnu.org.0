Hmm ... I managed to accidentally mark this one as read.

Anyway, I spent the Friday writing the RFC I just sent out instead.

Well, my take is more looking at a part of the codebase that I was not
previously familiar with, seeing things that seemed redundant, but not
being confident enough to dismiss them outright so having to spend
time investigating (and asking silly questions on list).

Well, I think any OS that tries to be generically bootable *has* to
ignore that value, although it could be useful for informational
purposes.

My feeling is none of the values there are appropriate (arm,armv8
indicates ARM ltd, but not aarch64 support). I made something up for
the RFC set. We could always send a patch adding some qemu, or
generic, target.

Reduce the delta between internal development and upstream.

This is not a suggestion NUVIA has a vast army of qemu developers
ready to implement all features supported by ARMv8.whatever.
But sometimes all we need is an instruction trace, and for that we
need to make sure any selection sequences pick the optimal ones we do
intend to implement.
