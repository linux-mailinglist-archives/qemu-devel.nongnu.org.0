Public bug reported:

I don't know if it's a problem, but I did, and it bothered me for a long ti=
me.
When I use qemu-i386 and interact with the video card device,an error has o=
ccurred:

18534 ioctl(4,DRM_IOCTL_MODE_GETENCODER,{39,0,0,0,0}) =3D 0 ({39,4,34,3,0})
18534 ioctl(4,DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB,{1080,1920,32,0,0,0,0}) =3D 0 ({10=
80,1920,32,0,1,7680,8294400})
18534 ioctl(4,DRM_IOCTL_MODE_ADDFB,{0,1920,1080,7680,32,24,1}) =3D 0 ({66,1=
920,1080,7680,32,24,1})
18534 ioctl(4,DRM_IOCTL_MODE_MAP_DUMB,{1,0,0}) =3D 0 ({1,0,5543018496})
18534 mmap2(NULL,8294400,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,4,0x14a63c) =3D -1=
 errno=3D22 (Invalid argument)

"5543018496" is the offset through ioctl() and it is "0x14a63c000".
In qemu=EF=BC=9A
ret =3D target_mmap(arg1, arg2, arg3,
      target_to_host_bitmask(arg4, mmap_flags_tbl),
      arg5, arg6 << MMAP_SHIFT);

The type of "arg6" is ulong.When use qemu-i386, arg6 can't be set to
"0x14a63c000".So it's wrong for my program.

I want to find a good way to deal with this kind of problem, but I'm not ve=
ry familiar with QEMU=EF=BC=8C
so I came to ask how to deal with this problem.

Thank you=EF=BC=81
