It's the way QEMU works -- generally load/store operations
that work on virtual addresses are expected to only return
in the success case; on failure they longjmp out to cause
the guest exception. (Load/stores on physical addresses
generally return a memory transaction status for the caller
to check and handle.) I agree that within the translation code
it's a bit weird and it might be nicer for the translate.c
code to explicitly handle failures to load an insn, but it
would be a bit of an upheaval to try to rewrite it at this point.

cpu_ldl_code() is provided by include/exec/cpu_ldst.h, incidentally
(via preprocessor macros and repeated inclusion of some template
.h files, which is why a grep for the function name misses it).

Yeah, I'm implicitly suggesting that a bit more thought/revision
of the spec might not be a bad idea. Things that are
effectively supposed to be treated like a single instruction
but which can cross cacheline or page boundaries turn out
to be a fertile source of implementation bugs. (The arm
translate.c code has to be quite careful about handling
32-bit Thumb insns that cross pages. The x86 translate.c
code is less careful and may well be buggy in this area.)
