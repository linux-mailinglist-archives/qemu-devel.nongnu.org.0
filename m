I'm afraid this would be opening a Pandora's box. For such rare cases, a
message from a person: "Please hold on this patch until I am back from
vacation.", "Please wait until I merge my series acting on the same files",
or similar, would perfectly do the job, as it did in the past.

We are fixing something that is not broken.
