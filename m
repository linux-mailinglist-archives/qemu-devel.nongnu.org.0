Almost all of the use of the non-overlap versions is
for "these are never going to overlap" -- devices or ram at
fixed addresses in the address space that can't
ever be mapped over by anything else. If you want
"can overlap but I don't care which one wins" then
that would be more clearly expressed by using the _overlap()
version but just giving everything that can overlap there
the same priority.

Yeah, good point, for the special case where it's the
guest that's determining the addresses where something's
mapped we might want to allow the behaviour to fall out
of the implementation. (You could instead specify set of
priorities that makes the undefined-behaviour something
specific, rather than just an emergent property of
the implementation QEMU happens to have, but it seems
a bit hard to justify.)
