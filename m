sorry about the confusion. I mean this condition:
about to migrate, openstack searches if there are existing matching
MDEVs,
if yes, i.e. all common/vendor specific fields match, then just create
a VM with the matching target MDEV. (in this condition, the PCI ID field
is not ignored);
if not, openstack tries to create one MDEV according to mdev_type, and
configures MDEV according to the vendor specific attributes.
as PCI ID is not a configurable field, it just ignore the field.

Thanks
Yan
