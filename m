No, sorry for the confusing example. I was thinking of
qemu-storage-daemon or multi-process QEMU where devices could be
configured over a QMP/HMP monitor. The device happens to be implemented
in the QEMU codebase but the VMM doesn't need a stub device.

A D-Bus or gRPC example would have been clearer because it's not
associated with a VMM.

We can migrate a device with rx-filter-size=3D16 from old -> new if the
new device implementation supports rx-filter-size=3D16. We can migrate
back to the old device implementation because it supports
rx-filter-size=3D16.

If you want to change the configuration parameters then new device must
be instantiated during poweroff or hotplug. This is how
rx-filter-size=3D16 can be changed to rx-filter-size=3D32, but it must be
done explicitly (configuration parameters don't change across
migration).

Discussion on the mdev sysfs interface has started in the sub-thread

Good point. Most rollback migrations still work, only the ones that

Can you explain in more detail?

I think the approach described in this document works, except it
requires manual intervention to change device configuration parameters
whereas subsections are automatically applied by the new QEMU.
