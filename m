The QAPI schema isn't what I was thinking about....  in block/nbd.c
we have the same restriction you lifted here

        tlscreds =3D nbd_get_tls_creds(s->tlscredsid, errp);
        if (!tlscreds) {
            goto error;
        }

        /* TODO SOCKET_ADDRESS_KIND_FD where fd has AF_INET or AF_INET6 *=
/
        if (s->saddr->type !=3D SOCKET_ADDRESS_TYPE_INET) {
            error_setg(errp, "TLS only supported over IP sockets");
            goto error;
        }

For client side we would also need to allow a 'tls-hostname' parameter
in BlockdevOptionsNbd, so that the client can pass a hostname to use
for validating the x509 certificate, the same way we allow for live
migration.

Daniel
