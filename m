Commit 5f76a7aac156ca75680dad5df4a385fd0b58f6b1 is looking harmless from
the first glance, but it has changed things a lot. 'libvirt' uses it to
detect that it should follow new initialization way and this changes
things considerably. With this procedure followed, blockdev_init() is
not called anymore and thus block_acct_setup() helper is not called.

This means in particular that defaults for block accounting statistics
are changed and account_invalid/account_failed are actually initialized
as false instead of true originally.

This commit changes things to match original world. There are the following
constraints:
* new default value in block_acct_init() is set to true
* block_acct_setup() inside blockdev_init() is called before
  blkconf_apply_backend_options()
* thus newly created option in block device properties has precedence if
  specified

Changes from v1:
* set account_invalid/account_failed to true by default
* pass OnOffAuto to block_acct_init() to handle double initialization (patch 1)
* changed properties on BLK device to OnOffAuto
