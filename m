IMHO we should stay as far away from Perl as possible, and I say this as
someone who enjoys writing Perl scripts !  Perl is a significant barrier
to entry for potential contributors, because it just doesn't have the
wide knowledge base that it did in the past. You can expect most people
to have some familiarity with Python, or be able to pick it up fairly
easily in a way that just isn't possible in Perl.

As for shell, we have a never ending stream of bugs due to the wide
range of different shell impls which make portable coding very hard.

In general I think our overall goal should be to focus on getting down to
use of a single scripting language in QEMU, and that language clearly has
to be python3. We shouldn't introduce any new usage of Perl or Shell
in QEMU IMHO. Even if we think the usage will only be short term temporary
workaround, short term hacks in QEMU have a habit of living for years longer
than we expect.

IIUC, the motivation of this series is just to remove some duplication
of defaults / args, nothing more than that ?

If correct, then I'd say it probably isn't worth the hassle. I'd say we
should focus effort on just converting more of configure to meson, as
quickly as practical, and not try to add much more magic that's only
relevant for the transition time.

Daniel
