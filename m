No, these hunks don't show an improvement. An earlier {'return':{}}
means that the block job coroutine has yielded earlier, so it's doing a
blocking operation where it didn't do one before the patch.

What happens is that qcow2_detect_metadata_preallocation() causes
additional I/O by reading in the refcount block.

I'll modify the commit message accordingly while applying.
