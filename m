My point is that host userspace does not necessarily live in a PAPR

Since apparently POWER's version of "compatibility" is "close but not
quite".

Anyway, after our discussion on Monday, I'm more or less resigned to
the need for HostThrs here.  Still some changes I'd like to see here.

First, I'd like an explanatory comment in get_system_parameter,
explaining what the value is used for.  Mention that it's not in PAPR
and say what little you can about who decided on this representation.

Second, I still really dislike directly grovelling around in the host
device tree.  THe fallbacks you have will probably work in practice,
but I really think it assumes too much about what the host environment
will look like.  Plus it, again, makes a guest visible difference
based on host properties which we want to avoid.  We'd probably get
away with this one (the worst is you'd have messed up PURR scaling
after migration), but still.

I was thinking we could use kvmppc_smt_threads(), but that will be
wrong for POWER9, I think.  Plus it still means guest visible
differences between TCG and KVM (or even different KVM types).

I actually think the right way to do this is to have qemu base it on
the PVR (i.e. look up the information in its internal cpu table).
That way it should give sensible and identical results for KVM and TCG
- with the only KVM dependence being that KVM and -cpu host selects
the exact cpu model for you.

That may give non-1 values for TCG and KVM PR, which could result in
bogus scaling... but AFAICT PURR values will be kind of bogus in those
situations anyway, so I don't know that it matters.
