** Description changed:

  When using KVM, and an OS that supports the IOAPIC, interrupts mapped on
  IRQ2 (for instance, routing an HPET timer on interrupt 2) will cause the
  interrupts to never be delivered. This is because QEmu, when setting up
  the KVM interrupt routes, will not set one up for IRQ2[0]. When running
  without KVM, IRQ2 is identity-mapped to GSI2.
  =

  My understanding is that IRQs should be identity mapped to their
  equivalent GSI unless a redirection entry is present in the MADT. This
  is supported by ACPI 6.2 spec[1], 5.2.12.5 Interrupt Source Override
  Structure, which claims: "It is assumed that the ISA interrupts will be
  identity-mapped into the first I/O APIC sources.".
  =

  I stumbled across this while working on my own custom OS, got very
  confused why the HPET wasn't triggering any interruption - and even more
  confused why the behavior only happened in KVM and not in non-KVM.
  =

- Version tested: QEMU emulator version 4.0.50
- (v4.0.0-226-g8482ff2eb3-dirty)
+ EDIT: Interestingly, the HPET only supports IRQ2 under qemu, which,
+ combined with this bug, makes it completely unusable.

Title:
  IRQ2 ignored under KVM when using IOAPIC

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When using KVM, and an OS that supports the IOAPIC, interrupts mapped
  on IRQ2 (for instance, routing an HPET timer on interrupt 2) will
  cause the interrupts to never be delivered. This is because QEmu, when
  setting up the KVM interrupt routes, will not set one up for IRQ2[0].
  When running without KVM, IRQ2 is identity-mapped to GSI2.

  My understanding is that IRQs should be identity mapped to their
  equivalent GSI unless a redirection entry is present in the MADT. This
  is supported by ACPI 6.2 spec[1], 5.2.12.5 Interrupt Source Override
  Structure, which claims: "It is assumed that the ISA interrupts will
  be identity-mapped into the first I/O APIC sources.".

  I stumbled across this while working on my own custom OS, got very
  confused why the HPET wasn't triggering any interruption - and even
  more confused why the behavior only happened in KVM and not in non-
  KVM.

  EDIT: Interestingly, the HPET only supports IRQ2 when using the
  default PIIX chipset, which, combined with this bug, makes it
  completely unusable.
