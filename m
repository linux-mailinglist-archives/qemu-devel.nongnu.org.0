Yes.  We could update the test for current Sphinx then, and disable it
for old Sphinx.  Not ideal, but good enough, I think.

Again, we could also update the test for current Sphinx then, and
disable it for old Sphinx.

Diffing plain text output is a weaker test than diffing the intermediate
Texinfo or a Sphinx unparse.  Still better than nothing.

Blocking this series on a a yet-to-be-written unparse extension would be
a bad idea.  But thinking things through is not :)
