That would be helpful, we are always short on reviewers.

It's not fully internal though. Someone running with the `-d int`
command line argument will see these exceptions, which don't
correspond to anything in the spec.

Is there some way we could at least convey that information to users?

I think it would at least be better to use a high reserved number, but
like I mentioned above this is somewhat user visible.

That makes sense. If they start to diverge we can also re-split them out though.

AFAIK that unfortunately never progressed too far.

That would be helpful.

When doing that make sure to split the patches up (this one is already
a little big) so that the ARM people can just review 1 patch.

I saw that, that is good news.

I don't have an idea off the top of my head, hopefully Richard already
knows the answer here :)
