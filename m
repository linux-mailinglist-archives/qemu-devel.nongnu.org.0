This is what I understand we need, but this is not what
qdev_unplug() does.

Bad or not, I thought the whole point of doing it inside QEMU was
to do something libvirt wouldn't be able to do (namely,
unplugging the device while not freeing resources).  If we are
doing something that management software is already capable of
doing, what's the point?
