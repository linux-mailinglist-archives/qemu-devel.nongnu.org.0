I was able to get both running on 3.11.0, but something broke again by
the time I re-tested on 4.0.0. 98 seems to work on 4.0 at least, but 95
just reboots infinitely after trying to boot from HDD after the initial
setup. I tried searching their mailing list and asking around but nobody
seems interested in fixing it.

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
