I know I had reservations about this, but we now have two patches on list that
fix the problem in this way.

What I would *like* is for each CPUBreakpoint to maintain a list of the TBs to
which it has been applied, so that each can be invalidated.  Our current
management of breakpoints are IMO sloppy.

That said, I don't really have time to work on cleaning this up myself in the
short term, and this is fixing a real bug.  Therefore, I am going to queue this
to tcg-next.

I would still like patch 2/2 to be split, and that can probably go through an
xtensa branch.
