It will be nice to have the monitor code split up a bit more.

I'm not a fan, however, of having both $ROOT/qmp.c and $ROOT/monitor/qmp.c
Likwise  $ROOT/hmp.c and $ROOT/monitor/hmp.c.  Can we move those other
existing files out of the root dir, into monitor/, so we don't have two
files with the same name in different dirs.

Regards,
Daniel
