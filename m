I thought the 'software_version' was supposed to describe kind of a
'protocol version' for the data we transmit? I.e., you add a new field,
you bump the version number.

We're talking about the features offered by the device, right? Would it
be sufficient to mandate that the target device supports the same
features or a superset of the features supported by the source device?

My proposal would be:
- check that device_api matches
- check possible device_api specific attributes
- check that type matches [I don't think the combination of mdev types
  and another attribute to determine compatibility is a good idea;
  actually, the current proposal confuses me every time I look at it]
- check that software_version is compatible, assuming semantic
  versioning
- check possible type-specific attributes

Nod.
