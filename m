We like to pretend QOM introspection is not a stable interface.  Except
for the parts that have to be, because they're the only way to probe for
certain things.  We're not telling you which parts, because we have no
idea ourselves.

If we replace qdev paths by QOM paths, the "doesn't really reflect the
way the system is built up in terms of QOM components" goes away.

However, the "we might one day want to restructure things" argument also
applies to QOM.

At some point we need to decide which part of the cake to feed to users,
and which part to keep for developers to mess with.
