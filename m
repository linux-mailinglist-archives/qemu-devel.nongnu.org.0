Hi Stefan,

Sorry we missed this comment. We originally added this to enable
separate MMIO channels for each device in the remote process.

Given we are going to add a separate channel for each device in the
remote process based on the recent discussions, we could remove the
separate channel for MMIO.

Thank you very much!
