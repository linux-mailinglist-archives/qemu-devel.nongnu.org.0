Yes, the issue "replacing chardev-add by object-add loses QAPI
introspection" evaporates when object-add becomes QAPI-introspectable.

Nobody argues this can't be done.  Some of us argue it should not be
done :)

Let me split this into multiple questions:

1. Does qsd need a CLI beyond whatever is needed to provide QMP?

2. If yes, does it need to be stable?

3. Does it need to be machine-friendly?

4. Does it need to be human-friendly?

5. What does it mean to be human-friendly?

I'd expect Kevin to answer question 1. and 4. with an emphatic yes.  I
concur, because without a usable CLI, ad hoc usability is awful.  My
idea of "usable" is probably less demanding than Kevin's, but that's
question 5 already.

The step from a QMP command that returns nothing to machine-friendly CLI
option is almost trivial: -blockdev with a JSON argument proves it.
This makes me answer 3. with "why not?", and 2. with "this
machine-friendly interface is stable by construction".

We already paid for the step from machine-friendly CLI to a slightly
more human-friendly CLI: -blockdev with a dotted keys argument proves
it.  This makes me answer 4. with "why not / why override the qsd
maintainer?"

Question 5. is open-ended.  I think a truly human-friendly CLI will take
extra work, similar to how HMP does.  I believe it can be done with less
overhead than HMP has today.  I don't plan to sink a lot of time into it
myself, at least not in the immediate future.

Making people type --i-am-not-a-script is begging for getting pelted
with vegetables at the next non-virtual KVM Forum.

I think what you're trying to accomplish is to tell a program off when
it uses a part of the CLI programs should not use.  My "Configurable
policy for handling deprecated interfaces" series can grow to do exactly
that, but it's opt-in (because I don't fancy getting pelted with
vegetables).
