Because I want to store the bandwidth or latency value (minimum unit) 
that user input. In HMAT, the minimum unit of bandwidth is MB/s, but in 
QAPI, the minimum unit of size is Byte. So I convert size into MB/s and 
time unit is "ps", need not convert.

For HMAT spec, for a matrix of bandwidth or latency, there is only one 
base (in order to save ACPI tables space). We need to extract base for a 
matrix, but user input bandwidth or latency line by line. So after all 
data input, we can extract the base (as in 9/11).

There is another benefit. If user input different but similar units, 
such as "10ns" and "100ps", we can also store them. Only If user input 
big gap units, such as "1ps" and "1000ms". we can't store them and raise 
error.
