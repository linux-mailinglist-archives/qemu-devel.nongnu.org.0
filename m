To make sure I understand - you're implying that one such query will
return the PA from the guest's perspective, right?

Does this mean it will be difficult to get the physical address for the
bytes containing the instruction encoding itself?

Assuming that the purpose of "not leaking implementation details" is to
allow the same plugin interface to work with other backend
implementations in the future, isn't this probably fine? It may add an
unnecessary limitation for another backend driving the same plugin
interface, but I don't think it likely changes the structure of the
interface itself. And that seems like the sort of restriction that could
easily be dropped in the future while remaining backwards-compatible.

Oh, so you're already working on doing just what I asked about?

Awesome, thanks!

In terms of our use case - we use QEMU to drive studies to help us
design the next generation of processors. As you can imagine, having the
right physical addresses is important for some aspects of that. We're
currently using a version of Pavel Dovgalyuk's earlier plugin patchset
with some of our own patches/fixes on top, but it would obviously make
our lives easier to work together to get this sort of infrastructure
upstream!
