Might well be, but how is it wrong?  (I'd like to improve).

Ahah I don't have your head either!  The idea anyway is to reuse
prefixes that are common in Rust code:

* with_: a constructor that uses something to build a type (think
Vec::with_capacity) and therefore takes ownership

* as_: a cheap conversion to something, it's cheap because it reuses the
lifetime (and therefore takes no ownership).  Think Option::as_ref.

* from_/to_: a copying and possibly expensive conversion (that you have
to write the code for).  Because it's copying, it doesn't consume the
argument (for from_) or self (for to_).

* into_: a conversion that consumes the receiver

It may well be over the top.

Maybe I'm wrong, but why would you need just one?

Yes, that's the main difference.  I removed Storage because I didn't
want to force any trait on BorrowedPointer's second type argument.  It
seemed like a generic concept to me.

The other difference is that Stash is a tuple while BorrowedPointer is a
struct and has methods to access it.  Stash seems very ugly to use.

Sure, no problem.
