Before calling machine_set_cpu_numa_node, we call
cpu_index_to_instance_props -> x86_cpu_index_to_props->
possible_cpu_arch_ids->x86_possible_cpu_arch_ids.

This sequence sets up the arch_id(in x86_cpu_apic_id_from_index) for all
the available cpus. Based on the arch_id, it also sets up the props.
And these props values are used to assign the nodes in
machine_set_cpu_numa_node.

At this point we are still parsing the numa nodes and so we don't know the
total number of numa nodes. Without that information, the arch_id
generated here will not be correct for EPYC models.

This is the reason for changing the generic numa code(patch #12-Split the
numa initialization).

It is all the exact same topo functions. Only making these functions as
the handlers inside the X86CPUDefinition.

Eduardo already commented on this idea. Anything specific to cpu models
should be part of the X86CPUDefinition. We should not compare the specific
model here. Comparing the specific model does not scale. We are achieving
this by loading the model definition(similar to what we do in
x86_cpu_load_model).

Once again, this does not scale. Please see my response above.

I can post my draft patch to give you more idea about what i am talking
about now. Let me know.

Hardware does not support this configuration. That is why I did not think
it is serious enough to fix this problem right now.
