Well, my understanding is:

- it's not about whether or not we have an actual device that can do DMA 
into itself but whether it's allowed by PCI spec
- it's not really matter whether or not it tries to DMA into itself. 
Devices could be taught to DMA into each other's RX:

e1000e(1) RX DMA to e1000e(2) MMIO (RX)
e1000e(2) RX DMA to e1000e(1) RX

So we get re-reentrancy again.

Right, so about the solution, instead of refactoring DMA I wonder we can 
simply detect and fail the RX by device itself.
