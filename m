Correct. The only place libvirt will ever assign devices anywhere except=20
function 0 is when we are adding pcie-root-ports - those are combined=20
8-per-slot in order to conserve space on pcie.0 (this permits us to have=20
up to 240 PCIe devices without needing to resort to upstream/downstream=20
switches).

I guess that's all a matter of opinion. If the user never enters in any=20
PCI address info and it's all handled by someone else, then I wouldn't=20
expect them to know exactly where the devices were (and only vaguely=20
understand that their hostdev network interface is going to be unplugged=20
during migration). In that case (as long as it's libvirt assigning the=20
PCI addresses) the situation we're considering would never ever happen,=20
so it's a non-issue.

If, on the other hand, the user wants to mess around assigning PCI=20
addresses themselves, then they get to pick up all the pieces. It might=20
be nice if they could be given a clue about why it broke though.

If, as you claim, it's not difficult, then I guess why not?
