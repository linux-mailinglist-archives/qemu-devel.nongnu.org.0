cat /proc/meminfo | grep AnonHugePages:
This command will output how many THPs is used by current system.
There is no program using THPs except qemu.
So this command will show how many THPs is used by qemu.

The last outout of =E2=80=9Ccat /proc/meminfo | grep AnonHugePages:=E2=80=9D=
 show how many THPs is used by qemu when this 2 qemu=E2=80=99s anon page =
number is same.
Without =E2=80=9Ccont-pages=3Don=E2=80=9D, qemu keep 65536kb THPs.
Wiht =E2=80=9Ccont-pages=3Don=E2=80=9D, qemu keep 907264kb THPs.
Keep more THPs will make memory access speed high.

This is a test record use this 1G 1 cpu qemu after the fragmentation =
balloon test:
Without =E2=80=9Ccont-pages=3Don=E2=80=9D, qemu keep 81920kB THPs.
