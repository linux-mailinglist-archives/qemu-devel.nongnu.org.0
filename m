If we aim to behave like a "real processor", then why do we implement 
PSCI using HVC? A much more likely "real processor" would implement EL3, 
but no EL2 and then have PSCI as SMC calls, no?

My understanding for the rationale on why we do PSCI over HVC by default 
was to make the VM as similar between KVM and TCG as possible.

I would assume so as well, but I don't have a working ATF setup handy. 
I'm also not worried about making it work for me - I have my local debug 
setup now :). I'm worried about a good out of the box experience for 
users who want to run Windows on ARM in TCG.
