I don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s true:

Examine the case where we have the following chain:

A <- B <- C

When we rebase C directly over A: qemu-img rebase -b A C

We must check for every offset (sector): bdrv_is_allocated_above(C, A, =
offset, n, &n);

If a sector from C is allocated above A - it may have been changed - so =
we need to do a read from A and a read from C and compare.
If the sector is not allocated above, it was not changed - we don=E2=80=99=
t need to read from A or C.
