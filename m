Hi,

I recently ran into problems and after a long time trying to find out the c=
ause landed here, I got in trouble using a CentOs Cloud image:
https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1905.=
qcow2.xz
which extracts to a .qcow2 image with sha256 of:
b376afdc0150601f15e53516327d9832216e01a300fecfc302066e36e2ac2b39

image: CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1905.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 8.0G (8589934592 bytes)
disk size: 898M
cluster_size: 65536
Format specific information:
    compat: 0.10
    refcount bits: 16

I use this command on a Mac, OS X 10.13.6 (17G7024), qemu installed via bre=
w:
qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O vmdk -o adapter_type=3Dlsilogic,subformat=3Dst=
reamOptimized,compat6=3Don -p CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1905.qcow2 -S 0 =
result.vmdk


941359104 21 Jul 17:11 CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1905.qcow2 - original i=
mage

Converting this gives these results:
214551040 23 Jul 20:45 conv_mac_v3_1_mit_s_0.vmdk - doesnt work, made on Ma=
c (APFS) with -S 0 =

402303488 23 Jul 20:50 conv_mac_v3_1_auf_exfat.vmdk - works and is bootable=
, made on same Mac, on external drive, exFAT formatted.
149743104 23 Jul 21:21 conv_mac_v4_0.vmdk - doesnt work, made on Mac (APFS)=
 without -S 0 =

214551040 23 Jul 21:20 conv_mac_v4_0mit_S0.vmdk - doesnt work, made on Mac =
(APFS) with -S 0 =


converting on non-Mac also works fine:
402303488 23 Jul 18:48 conv_centos7_v1-5-3.vmdk - works and is bootable, ma=
de on Centos, qemu-img version 1.5.3

So it seems that '-S 0' didn't fix it for me, or is that only in the
development branch?

Best Regards
