I disagree with "necessary".

A client can use a specific version of QMP, and still talk to a server
with a different version, because we designed that capability into QMP.

You absolutely can create bindings for a specific version of QMP for the
client if you want.  Just make sure the client as a whole obeys the
rules of the QMP game laid down in qmp-spec.txt and qapi-code-gen.txt.

Two points.

1. Opaque dictionaries are far from the only way to do keyword arguments
in a language that lacks them.

2. The API we generate for C is not exactly wonderful.

Behold this beauty:

    void qmp_block_commit(bool has_job_id, const char *job_id, const char *=
device, bool has_base_node, const char *base_node, bool has_base, const cha=
r *base, bool has_top_node, const char *top_node, bool has_top, const char =
*top, bool has_backing_file, const char *backing_file, bool has_speed, int6=
4_t speed, bool has_on_error, BlockdevOnError on_error, bool has_filter_nod=
e_name, const char *filter_node_name, bool has_auto_finalize, bool auto_fin=
alize, bool has_auto_dismiss, bool auto_dismiss, Error **errp);

It's gotten so bad we added a second way to do the C API:

    void qmp_drive_backup(DriveBackup *arg, Error **errp);

Turns out

    DriveBackup arg =3D {
        ... initialize the optionals you need ...
    }
    qmp_drive_backup(&arg, &err);

is a lot easier on the eyes than passing 29 positional arguments.

This could be viewed as a work-around for C's lack of positional
parameters.

Even more fun:

    void qmp_blockdev_add(BlockdevOptions *arg, Error **errp);

BlockdevOptions is a tagged union.

This could be viewed as a work-around for C's lack of function
overloading.

I disagree.  You won't be able to write good bindings using just
positional parameters.  Not even if you add restrictions on how we can
evolve QMP.  And no, I do not consider the C bindings we create for QEMU
itself "good".  They're the best we could do, and good enough.

When you do bindings for another language, do bindings for that
language, not C bindings in that language.

Regardless of bindings, the client as a whole should obey the rules of
the QMP game laid down in qmp-spec.txt and qapi-code-gen.txt.  If these
rules have become counter-productive, then it's time to replace QMP
wholesale.

Do not attempt to force a square peg into a round hole.  If we must have
square pegs, design a square hole, and retire the round hole.

Paolo pointed out successful protocols that make tradeoffs similar to
QMP to support the idea that these tradeoffs can make sense and are
workable.

Pointing out other, dissimilar protocols is not a convincing
counter-argument :)
