Yeah, these external requests are bad in general. Not only for
performance - also because they can fail silently (if there is unmovable
data on it).

In theory, the host can simply track inflation requests. In practice,
guests tend to sometimes re-access balloon-inflated memory (e.g., simple
kexec-style reboot under Linux, kdump on older Linux versions), so it's
not completely safe to do.

Yeah, something similar was proposed for virtio-balloon already (and
there is a paper about that - see below). For virito-balloon, we were
not yet convinced that stealing most hugepages from the guest is always
such a good idea. It at least would have to be configurable, to not mess
with existing use cases.

Same on Linux - but the pages are movable, such they can at least moved
around to offline + unplug a DIMM.

Some of the reasons why ballooning + DIMMs are not used as far as I know is:
- Management issues. Using it without some managing instance
  (plug/unplug DIMM, control balloon) is impossible. Try using it with
  bare QEMU - basically impossible.
- Memory Hotplug limitations: Maximum DIMM count. Minimum DIMM size that
  an OS can use (e.g., >= 128MiB under Linux, sometimes even 1GB). The
  granularity restrictions you mentioned apply.
- Memory Hotplug reliability: It can happen easily that hotplugging a
  DIMM / onlining it under Linux fails (e.g., minimum DIMM size). "What
  you think the guests actually has as available memory might be wrong".
  If you ignore that (and you don't even get notified) and adjust the
  balloon later, your (Linux) guest might be in trouble. Assume
  you hotplug a 8GB to a 2G VM and later try to inflate the balloon to
  4GB ... so you need reliable monitoring and error handling.

So yeah, I can understand how hv-balloon tries to work around some of
these issues.

Yes, because I assume Windows doesn't really care too much about
optimizing for virtio-balloon. There isn't too much external developers
can do about that. See below for hugepage ballooning in virtio-balloon.

I'm not a friend of leaving the challenging/fundamental problems to be
sported out in the future (e.g., resizing initial boot memory, dealing
with fundamental limits - like KVM memory slots or VMA). But I get how
it's easier to get something running this way :)

Yes, one memory backend per virtio-mem device. You usually have one
device per NUMA node.

So, virtio-mem will (in the future, still to be upstreamed by me) use
resizeable memory regions / ramblocks / KVM memory slots. The region can
grow (e.g., memory hotplug) and shrink (e.g., during reboot, but later
also if unplugged memory would allow for it). Nice thing is that
migration code fully supports resizeable ramblocks already.

Resizes are triggered by the virtio-mem device, so stuff is completely
handled inside QEMU. For hv-balloon, you could grow the region when
required (e.g., balloon X, whereby X is > ram size after inflating), and
shrink during reboot (or whenever it might be valid to shrink). However,
you cannot "rip out" anything in between, you'll have to rely on
MADV_DONTNEED until the guests reboots (well, just like basic
ballooning) and you can definitely shrink the region.

That's the tradeoff virtio-mem decided to take for now to be able to
manage any size changes + migration completely in QEMU, avoiding any
coordination with an external entity (e.g., libvirt in your example)
when resizing a guest.

Interesting, thanks.

That would be interesting for me - like which limits do actually apply
under Hyper-V.

Exactly my thoughts, that's why I tried to avoid that as well with
virtio-mem.

Yeah, one of the main issues of memory ballooning.

Partially yes, partially no. It doesn't really care about the second
case you mention ("few virtual DIMMs might always be inserted") due to
the way it works. And it does noever have to deal with "inflate balloon
after/during reboot".

A virtio-mem device manages only its assigned memory, it does not work
on random system memory like memory ballooning. So you can never unplug
initial memory.

However, you can do something like

-m 4G,maxmem=104G

and define a virtio-mem device with a maximum size of 100G and an
initial size of - say 16G. When booting up, the guest will detect the
additional 16GB and have effectively 20GB. However, you can only ever
shrink back down to 4GB (e.g., reliably during a reboot).

And it might not always be desirable (at least under Linux) to have
little boot memory - say the CMA allocator might want to reserve bigger
chunks of memory early during boot - if the initial memory size is too
small, this can fail easily.

Yeah, just like any heuristic, it can be wrong. I wonder if we could add
something similar for virtio-balloon (at least don't immediately deflate
until your VM dies ...).

Right, we have something similar for virtio-balloon, via the stats VQ.
IIRC, it's used by auto-ballooning mechanisms implemented in openstack
(I'd say similar to dynamic memory, it just won't try to increase the
size of a guest using new DIMMs).

Maybe OSX wants to be next and re-invent the wheel with a proprietary
balloon driver for a custom hypervisor. I think you get the idea.

What I'm saying is that I'd much rather want to see Windows
improve+extend virtio-balloon and such (virtio-mem), instead of
requiring hypervisors to implement undocumented, proprietary devices to
get stuff running somewhat smoothly in modern cloud environments. I have
the feeling that quite some stuff you mention can simply be "fixed" by
extending/improving virtio-baloon under Windows - for example, inflation
speed can be improved significantly by inflating in bigger chunks. See

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3240302.3240420

In contrast to hv-balloon *we* can extend/improve the
interface/stadnard/implementation on both sides (host/guest).

IIRC the Hyper-V enlightenment stuff is properly publicly documented -
whereby last time I checked, the hv-balloon is completely undocumented
and has to be reverse engineered from the Linux implementation. Please
correct me if I'm wrong - I am not able to spot references in your cover
letter as well - I'd be interested into that!

IIRC we need the devices either to bootstrap - e.g., use e1000 until we
can install virtio-net once the guest is up and running, or to support
older, unmodified guests. I'd like to stress that what you are proposing
is different in that sense. Your Windows VM will work just fine without
a hv-balloon device.

Again, just my personal opinion, I don't make any decisions around here :)
