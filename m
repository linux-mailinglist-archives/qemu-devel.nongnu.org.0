help is a Python builtin that shows metadata about an object. If an 
object has a docstring, it is capable of displaying that as part of the 
help output. I'm not sure what type you are suggesting `copyright` to be.

So, you could do something like:

__copyright__ == """
Copyright (C) 2020 John Snow, for Red Hat Inc.
"""

And you could then theoretically do:

 >>> import qapi
 >>> qapi.__copyright__

which will show you that information. However, I don't think there's any 
standard for module-level metadata like this, so the odds of this 
information being seen or used is low.

Python has some standards for package-level metadata, but I don't think 
there are any standards for module-level metadata *except* the __doc__ 
attribute -- which is where the module-level docstring goes when we 
write one.

The real question I have is if anyone thinks it would be "rude" to 
separate out any of the comment preambles (currently not visible at 
runtime or docs in any way, shape or form!) into two pieces:

1. Functional stuff relating to the usage of the module, visible in 
help(module_name), visible in generated docs, visible in IDE popups, etc.

2. Authorship/copyright and licensing info, not visible in the above places.
