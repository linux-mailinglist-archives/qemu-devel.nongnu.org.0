The zero flag means that the guest reads zeros, even with encrypted
files. I'm not sure if it's worse than exposing the information which
clusters are allocated and which are unallocated, which we have always
been doing and which is hard to avoid without encrypting all the
metadata, too. But it does reveal some information.

If we think that exposing zero flags is worse than exposing the
allocation status, I would still not use your solution above. In that
case, the full fix would be returning -ENOTSUP from
.bdrv_co_pwrite_zeroes() to cover all other callers, too.

If we think that allocation status and zero flags are of comparable
importance, then we need to fix either both or nothing. Hiding all of
this information probably means encrypting at least the L2 tables and
potentially all of the metadata apart from the header. This would
obviously require an incompatible feature flag (and some effort to
implement it).
