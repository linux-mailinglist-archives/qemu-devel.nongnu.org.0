QEMU, like libvirt, has a github.com project which contains automated
read-only mirrors of QEMU repositories.

  https://github.com/qemu/

An unfortunate side effect of this is that some users will try to open
pull requests against these mirrors. These get ignored until eventually
someone notices and closes the request. QEMU has had about 90 prs opened
over the years.

  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/pulls

The same applies to the issue tracker, but fortunately github lets
projects disable this feature, which QEMU has done.

I have recently discovered that there is a nice 3rd party bot for github
which can autorespond to pull requests with a friendly comment, close the
request, and then lock it to prevent further comments.

  https://github.com/apps/repo-lockdown

I'm setting this up for libvirt and it was suggested QEMU can probably
benefit from it too as an example see:

  https://github.com/libvirt/test/issues/2
  https://github.com/libvirt/test/pull/3


Configuration just requires creation of a ".github/lockdown.yml" file
which provides the friendly message to add to the merge requests. This
can be either done per-repository, or a special repo can be created
called ".github" and this will apply to all repos within the project.

Ideally each repo would have a CONTRIBUTING.md file created too, since
both GitHub and GitLab will direct users to this file for guidelines
on how to contribute.

I don't have time right now to do this for QEMU, so consider this email
a friendly suggestion for some other interested person to do for QEMU...

Regards,
Daniel
