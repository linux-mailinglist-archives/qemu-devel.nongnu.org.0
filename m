One reporter of a security issue recently complained that it might not
be the best idea to store our "Security Process" in the Wiki. Well, while
the page in the Wiki is protected (so that only some few people can edit
it), it is still possible that someone might find a bug in the Wiki
software to alter the page contents...
Anyway, it looks more trustworthy if we present the "Security Process"
information in the static website instead. Thus this patch adds the
information from the wiki to the Jekyll-based website now.

+## How to Contact Us Securely
+
+We use a GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG) keys to secure communications. M=
ail
+sent to members of the list can be encrypted with public keys of all membe=
rs
+of the list. We expect to change some of the keys we use from time to time=
.
+Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked.
+
+## How we respond
+
+Maintainers listed on the security reporting list operate a policy of
+responsible disclosure. As such they agree that any information you share =
with
+them about security issues that are not public knowledge is kept confident=
ial
+within respective affiliated companies. It is not passed on to any third-p=
arty,
+including Xen Security Project, without your permission.
+
+Email sent to us is read and acknowledged with a non-automated response. F=
or
+issues that are complicated and require significant attention, we will ope=
n an
+investigation and keep you informed of our progress. We might take one or =
more
+of the following steps:
+
+### Publication embargo
+
+As a security issue reported, that is not already publically disclosed
+elsewhere, has an embargo date assigned and communicated to reporter. Emba=
rgo
+periods will be negotiated by mutual agreement between members of the secu=
rity
+team and other relevant parties to the problem. Members of the security co=
ntact
+list agree not to publically disclose any details of the security issue un=
til
+the embargo date expires.
+
+### CVE allocation
+
+An security issue is assigned with a CVE number. The CVE numbers will usua=
lly
+be allocated by one of the vendor security engineers on the security conta=
ct
+list.
+
+## When to contact the QEMU Security Contact List
+
+You should contact the Security Contact List if:
+* You think there may be a security vulnerability in QEMU.
+* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects QEMU.
+* You can contact us in English. We are unable to respond in other languag=
es.
+
+## When *not* to contact the QEMU Security Contact List
+* You need assistance in a language other than English.
+* You require technical assistance (for example, "how do I configure QEMU?=
").
+* You need help upgrading QEMU due to security alerts.
+* Your issue is not security related.
+
+## How impact and severity of a bug is decided
+
+All security issues in QEMU are not equal. Based on the parts of the QEMU
+sources wherein the bug is found, its impact and severity could vary.
+
+In particular, QEMU is used in many different scenarios; some of them assu=
me
+that the guest is trusted, some of them don't. General considerations to t=
riage
+QEMU issues and decide whether a configuration is security sensitive inclu=
de:
+
+* Is there any feasible way for a malicious party to exploit this flaw and
+  cause real damage? (e.g. from a guest or via downloadable images)
+* Does the flaw require access to the management interface? Would the
+  management interface be accessible in the scenario where the flaw could =
cause
+  real damage?
+* Is QEMU used in conjunction with a hypervisor (as opposed to TCG binary
+  translation TCG)?
+* Is QEMU used to offer virtualised production services, as opposed to usa=
ge
+  as a development platform?
+
+Whenever some or all of these questions have negative answers, what appear=
s to
+be a genuine security flaw might be considered of low severity because it =
could
+only be exercised in use cases where QEMU and everything interacting with =
it is
+trusted.
+
+For  example, consider upstream commit [9201bb9 "sdhci.c: Limit the maximu=
m
+block size"](http://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dcommit;h=3D9201bb9), an=
 of out of
+bounds (OOB) memory access (ie. buffer overflow) issue that was found and =
fixed
+in the SD Host  Controller emulation (hw/sd/sdhci.c).
+
+Prima facie, this bug appears to be a genuine security flaw, with potentia=
lly
+severe implications. But digging further down, it shows that there are  on=
ly
+two ways to use SD Host Controller emulation, one is via 'sdhci-pci' inter=
face
+and the other is via 'generic-sdhci' interface.
+
+Of these two, the 'sdhci-pci' interface is relatively new and had actually=
 been
+disabled by default in the  upstream QEMU releases (commit [1910913 "sdhci=
:
+Make device "sdhci-pci" unavailable
+with -device"](http://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dcommit;h=3D1910913) a=
t the time
+the flaw was reported; therefore, guests could not possibly use 'sdhci-pci=
' for
+any  purpose.
+
+The 'generic-sdhci' interface, instead, had only one user in 'Xilinx Zynq
+Baseboard emulation' (hw/arm/xilinx_zynq.c). Xilinx Zynq is a programmable
+systems on chip (SoC) device. While QEMU does emulate this device, in prac=
tice
+it is used to facilitate cross-platform developmental efforts, i.e. QEMU i=
s
+used to write programs for the SoC device. In such developer environments,=
 it
+is generally assumed that the guest is trusted.
+
+And thus, this buffer overflow turned out to be a security non-issue.
+
+## What to Send to the QEMU Security Contact List
+
+Please provide as much information about your system and the issue as poss=
ible
+when contacting the list.
