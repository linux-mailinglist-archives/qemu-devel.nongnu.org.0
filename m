Those are all excellent assumptions.

My crystal ball came up blank on this one.

Not a closely guarded secret, just poor documentation.

Assuming AMD uses the same opcode as Intel, maybe they're expecting VMMs
to use the decode assist feature to check for the prefix?

Ah, I was stating what I would expect the KVM change to be, I didn't
realize this patch was merged almost a year ago.

I suppose theoretically it would allow live migrating from an old kernel
to a new kernel and gaining actual WBNOINVD support along the way?
