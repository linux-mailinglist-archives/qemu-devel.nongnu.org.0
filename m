How about .bdrv_dirty_bitmap_supports_persistent?

[which reminds me - a while ago, we had patches for qcow2 handling with 
64k bitmaps, or whatever insane number it took to overflow data 
structures, and I don't know if those ever got applied...]

Indeed, you (re-)discovered some of the very reasons why I chose to make 
a new interface.  I could tweak the commit message to mention 
alternatives, if that would help.
