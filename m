The guest cannot change all the relevant PMP registers for a single PMP 
entry atomically. This is why you normally update the PMP configuration 
in m-mode with MPRV unset for invalid but transient PMP states to have 
no adverse effects.

Eventually that is the case i.e. when the type is changed from TOR to 
NAPOT in (4), at which point everything is well and sane. But that can't 
happen atomically as I said. Yet QEMU does interpret the intermediate 
state although it shouldn't.

It is more efficient to prevent sa > ea in the first place as 
pmp_get_tlb_size() is called way more often than pmp_update_rule_addr().

Let's not forget that those sa/ea are simplified representations of the 
hardware and not what the guest can see. The original register content 
written by the guest is preserved.

Right. But this is not a PMP error. It is QEMU screwing up its internal 
state. It does even segfault when this condition occur if -d cpu is 
provided.

And it does. That's not where the problem is.

As I said, in the middle of updating the pmpcfg registers in (3), 
tlb_flush() is invoked which causes the core to revalidate its memory 
TLB cache down through pmp_get_tlb_size() where bad answers are 
returned. This causes the core to assume a different memory area which 
doesn't exist and the next memory access ends up calling 
unassigned_mem_accepts() where false is unconditionally returned. And I 
suspect this is also the result of a buffer overflow as the address 
logged in memory_region_access_valid() is sometimes complete garbage 
too, and the occasional QEMU segfault.

The spec says that a given memory access has to be >= the bottom 
boundary and < the top boundary for a PMP entry to match. So an invalid 
PMP entry should simply not match. That's what a hardware comparator 
would do: it would just not match. Furthermore, you cannot tell if the 
guest is in the middle of updating its PMP configuration which are split 
across several registers as illustrated above, therefore transient 
invalid states are unavoidable.
