Title:
  32-bit editors vim/rhide broken keyboard handling in freedos 1.1 and
  ms-dos 6.22

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  This bug is present as of the latest commit:
  714487515dbe0c65d5904251e796cd3a5b3579fb

  I also saw it in 2.4.1, but that was a distro package.

  You can see the bug simply using the following line: qemu-system-i386
  -hda freedos.disk

  Simply type vim (or rhide) and start entering in some text. You'll
  notice repeating characters, and also eventually the key mode will
  change as if you're holding down the shift button. Not capslock. "a"
  will become "A", but "\" will also become "|".

  I don't think this is a bug in freedos because I get the same behavior
  with dos 6.22. Not dosbox, though.
