Hi,

iotest 125 is very broken.  It uses qemu-img info=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cdisk=
 size=E2=80=9D to
determine an image=E2=80=99s on-disk size, but it does so in a wrong way:=
 It
just fetches the first number ([0-9]+), but that isn=E2=80=99t very usefu=
l
because qemu-img info emits human-readable values that include units and
decimal points.

We should ust stat -c %b instead.  That=E2=80=99s done in patch 3.
Unfortunately, doing so exposed more problems.

Patch 1 fixes a stupid bug in the test itself that we never noticed
because of what patch 3 fixes.  (Pull patch 3 before patch 1 and you=E2=80=
=99ll
see.)

The other thing is actually a bug in XFS.  Its fallocate()
implementation rounds up the length independently of the offset, so if
you try to fallocate an unaligned range, chances are that it might not
allocate the last block your range touches.  Patch 2 detects that case
and skips the test then.  (Pull patch 3 before patch 2 and you=E2=80=99ll=
 see
the test fail on XFS.)


Max Reitz (3):
  iotests: Fix 125 for growth_mode =3D metadata
  iotests: Disable 125 on broken XFS versions
  iotests: Use stat -c %b in 125
