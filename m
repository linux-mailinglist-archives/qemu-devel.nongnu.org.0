This sounds like a good idea.

I would further suggest that for bugs older than 5 years, we just close
them straightaway and skip this message. Users can always re-open or
re-file the bug in the very unlikely case they still care after 5 years.
We have some bugs that date from 2010, and just doesn't seem like we will
ever address those even if the user responded to the message by setting
it back to "New".

Daniel
