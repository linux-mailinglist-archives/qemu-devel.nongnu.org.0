>=20

Turned out to be much simpler than expect:

I reserved device ID 4106h under the vendor ID 110Ah (Siemens AG) for=20
the purpose of specifying a shared memory device via the VIRTIO TC. Will=20
update this "detail" in the next revision of the patches, also resetting=20
the device revision ID to 0 as no longer need to tell us apart from the=20
current implementation this way.
