It is data (the monitor coroutine) associated with an event handler
(graphic-update).

Someone has to hold the handler/data, and the console seems appropriate.

We could abstract this a bit, for ex, having a GHookList, but as long
as there is only one handler, it's unnecessary.

A CoQueue is a queue of coroutine. Similarly to the GHook suggestion,
I don't see much point as long as there is a single known handler.
Covering it through those abstractions will just lead to wrong
assumptions or code harder to read imho.
