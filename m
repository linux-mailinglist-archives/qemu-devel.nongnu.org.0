Yes, I saw the mention later.  I'm just wondering if we need to 
rearrange text to mention that the bits are reserved (set to 0, ignore 
on read) closer to the point where we document compressed clusters have 
no subclusters.

My argument is that BOTH bit settings make sense:

10 - reads as zero, but subcluster is not allocated
11 - reads as zero, and subcluster is allocated

Oh, I see.  I'm getting confused on the meanings of "allocated". 
Meaning 1: a host address is reserved for the guest address 
(pre-allocation sense).  Meaning 2: guest reads come from this layer 
rather than from the backing layer (COW/COR sense).

Pre-allocation is ALWAYS done a cluster at a time (you only have ONE 
host offset, shared among all 32 subclusters, per L2 entry), so either 
all 32 subclusters have a preallocated location, or none of them do. 
What is left, then, is a determination of whether to read locally or 
from the backing file, AND when reading locally, whether to read from 
the pre-allocated space or to just read zeroes.

We have 8 potential combinations (not all make sense):

host   zero alloc
   0      0    0     cluster unallocated, subcluster defers to backing
   0      0    1     error (except maybe for external data file)
   0      1    0     cluster unallocated, subcluster reads as zero
   0      1    1     error (except maybe for external data file)
  addr    0    0     cluster allocated, subcluster defers to backing
  addr    0    1     cluster allocated, subcluster reads from host
  addr    1    0     cluster allocated, subcluster reads as zero
  addr    1    1   error, or cluster allocated, subcluster reads as zero

Hmm - normally addr is non-zero (because the 0 addr is the metadata 
cluster of qcow2), but with external data file, host addr 0 is required 
for guest offset 0.  How do subclusters play with external data files? 
It makes sense to still have subclusters read as 0 or defer to backing 
with an external file (except maybe when raw external file is set).  But 
you did word it as if the alloc bit is set, the "host cluster offset 
field must contain a valid offset" which includes an offset of 0 for 
external data file.

If we mandate 10 for the reads-as-zero form, then whether addr is valid 
is irrelevant. If we mandate 11 for the reads-as-zero form, then addr 
must be valid even though we don't reference addr.  Having written all 
that, I agree that either form should work, but also that mandating one 
form leaves the door open for a future extension to define meaning to 
the form we did not permit (that is, either 10 or 11 becomes a reserved 
pattern that we can later give meaning to), vs. allowing both forms now 
and locking ourselves out of a future meaning.  And mandating addr to be 
valid even when reading zeroes doesn't use addr feels odd.

So, I'm okay with your choice of picking 00, 01, and 10 as the mandated 
forms, and declaring 11 as invalid for now (but a possible future 
extension).  Maybe I'll change my mind when seeing what complexity it 
adds to the qcow2 reference implementation, but hopefully not.
