It is not just tweaking the command line. The current EDK2 will not work
anymore if code is moved to plfash 0 since EDK2 assumed its entry point
is in pflash1. I agree there may not be too many users but if we have
to align with other archs, there will be combinations of qemu and
edk2 versions which won't work.

Thanks!. If this is the preference,  we can request people to use proper
versions of EDK2 with different qemu versions.

TBH, I don't know. I am sure Alistair would know since it was added in
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/1c20d3ff6004b600336c52cbef9f134fad3ccd94
I don't think opensbi can be launched from pflash. So, it may be some
other use case which I am now aware of.

I will be happy if this can be avoided by using -bios.

Thanks,
Sunil
