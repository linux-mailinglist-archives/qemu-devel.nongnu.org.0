No I'm talking about code that isn't changed by this series:

    if (initial_offset == 0) {
        v9fs_co_rewinddir(pdu, fidp);
    } else {
        v9fs_co_seekdir(pdu, fidp, initial_offset);
    }
    count = v9fs_do_readdir(pdu, fidp, max_count);

Leaving these outside the critical section seems to negate
your arguments... please clarify.

There are indeed several issues with the current readdir:

1) potential inconsistency on concurrent Treaddir requests

2) excessive dispatching to worker threads

So we agreed that 1) should never happen with a regular linux
client (we could even dump the lock actually) but we want to
make it clear in the code anyway that actions on the directory
stream are serialized.

2) basically means moving some logic from the frontend to the
backend, ie. called from v9fs_co_run_in_worker(). This implies
that a very long request (ie. one that would span on many calls
to readdir()) cannot be interrupted by the client anymore, as
opposed to what we have now BTW.

I tend to think that addressing both issues in one "rush" is
as much "error prone".

Then the whole seekdir/rewinddir/telldir/readdir sequence should
be called with a single v9fs_co_run_in_worker() invocation, in
which case the locking could just be something like:

int coroutine_fn v9fs_co_readdir_many(V9fsPDU *pdu, V9fsFidState *fidp,
                                      struct V9fsDirEnt **entries,
                                      int32_t maxsize, bool dostat)
{
    int err = 0;

    if (v9fs_request_cancelled(pdu)) {
        return -EINTR;
    }

    v9fs_readdir_lock(&fidp->fs.dir);

    v9fs_co_run_in_worker({
        err = do_readdir_many(pdu, fidp, entries, maxsize, dostat);
    });

    v9fs_readdir_unlock(&fidp->fs.dir);
    return err;
}

This would technically leave the locking in the main I/O thread,
but it isn't conceptually different from locking at the beginning
of do_readdir_lock() and unlocking before returning. My concern
is that I don't know how coroutine mutexes behave with multiple
worker threads...
