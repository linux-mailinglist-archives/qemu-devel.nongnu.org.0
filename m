Thanks for noticing this. I usually only test it during the freeze. Wasn't 
there a test patch submitted by Philippe before? Isn't that yet merged or 
included in CI? That should catch these before breaking it.

I'm afraid I don't remember but maybe I did not have a definitive answer 
even back then as the docs for this PCIe controller were not available so 
I've mostly worked from docs for similar SoCs and U-Boot and Linux sources 
so there were a lot of guessing. Maybe it's related to that the board maps 
peripheral addresses above 4GB as the first 4GB is reserved for memory? Or 
maybe there's some mixup between address spaces and the PCIe controller 
should have a separate address space that's mapped in the system? I did 
not have any knowledge about this back then and my understanding may still 
be lacking on how this should work.

The PCIe controllers of the 460EX are implemented at the end of 
hw/ppc/ppc440_uc.c (a lot of these 4xx SoCs are sharing components and the 
code organisation is a bit messy). As the comment near it says it's not 
really fully tested and working. only good enough for firmware and OSes 
get past testing it. I think trying to attach any device to it probably 
would fail or I would be surprised if the OS could actually talk to it as 
there may be some missing parts. So I'm happy with any solution that keeps 
the current state of being able to boot the OSes running on it (some of 
which like AmigaOS and MorphOS are closed source though so I don't know 
what their drivers need; closest open source OS to them is AROS but not 
sure that's working on real hardware). Some advice from somebody more 
knowledgeable about PCIe emulation in QEMU would be welcome here.

BALATON Zoltan
