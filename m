Hi, I have met a problem:

The QEMU version is 2.8.1, the virtual machine is configured with 1G huge p=
ages, two NUMA nodes and four pass-through NVME SSDs.

After we started the VM, in addition to some QMP queries nothing more has b=
een done, the QEMU aborted after some months later.
After that, the VM is restarted, and the problem does not reproduce yet.
And The backtrace of the RCU thread is as follows:
(gdb) bt

In this core, I found that the reference of "/objects/ram-node0"( the type =
of ram-node0 is struct "HostMemoryBackendFile") equals to 0 , while the ref=
erence of "/objects/ram-node1" equals to 129, more details can be seen at t=
he end of this email.

I searched through the community, and found a case that had the same error =
report: https://mail.coreboot.org/pipermail/seabios/2017-September/011799.h=
tml
However, I did not configure pcie_pci_bridge. Besides, qemu aborted in devi=
ce initialization phase in this case.

Also, I try to find out which can reference "/objects/ram-node0" so as to l=
ook for the one that may un reference improperly, most of them lie in the f=
unction of "render_memory_region" or "phys_section_add" when memory topolog=
y changes.
Later, the temporary flatviews are destroyed by RCU thread, so un reference=
 happened and the backtrace is similar to the one shown above.
But I am not familiar with the detail of these process, it is hard to keep =
trace of these memory topology changes.

My question is:
How can ram-node0's reference comes down to 0 when the virtual machine is s=
till running?

Maybe someone who is familiar with memory_region_ref or memory-backend-file=
 can help me figure out.
Any idea is appreciated.
