Agreed.

To bring VAAPI into Qemu directly you'd have to introduce bitstream
parser, DPB management and other CODEC specific bits. I cannot speak
for the project, but that's re-inventing the wheel again with very
little gain. Best is to open the discussion with them early.

Note that it's relatively simple in both framework to only choose HW
accelerated CODECs. In ffmpeg, HW accelerator codecs can only be used
with HWContext, so your wrapper need to know specific HWContext for the
specific accelerator. In GStreamer, since 1.16, we add a metadata that
let the user know which decoder is hardware accelerated. (This is
usually used to disable HW acceleration at the moment).
