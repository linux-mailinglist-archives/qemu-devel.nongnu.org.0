Note that's the pulse width, not the gap between the idx pulses.
My understanding is that an index pulse is once per rotation; ie. every
1/60th of a second.

The failure after 2 IDX pin pulses makes sense, that's saying if you've
not found a sector after spinning the disk twice then you fail.

So, your time to deliver a good result to a readid shoukd be the
rotational time for 1 or 2 sectors, where as the time to fail should
be the rotational time for about 2 whole rotations (ie 1/30 of a
second).
