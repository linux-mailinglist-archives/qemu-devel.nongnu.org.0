I mean extending the API to let custom setters and getters appear
on the Property array, not using the existing API.

That's a possibility, and maybe that could be the default
allow_set behavior.  It may be a bit tricky to convert the
existing backend objects to the new behavior in a gradual way,
though.

Parsing an array containing a handful of macros (a tiny subset of
C) isn't even comparable to parsing and executing C code where
object*_property_add*() calls can be buried deep in many levels
of C function calls (which may or may not be conditional).

(Also, I don't think we should allow handwritten Property literals.)

If we do that with the existing code, we can't be sure the
generated schema doesn't depend on configure flags or run time
checks inside class_init.  Even locating the cases where this is
happening is being a challenge because the API is too flexible.

However, if we require the property list to be always evaluated
at compile time, we can be sure that this method will be
reliable.

The list of tricky dynamic properties is large and I don't think
we even found all cases yet.  John documented many of them here:

https://gitlab.com/jsnow/qemu/-/blob/cli_audit/docs/cli_audit.md

Look, for example, for the sections named "Features" for CPU
options.

You are excluding instance-level object_property_add*() calls.
Most of them are supposed to be class properties but were never
converted.

You are also ignoring the complexity of the code path that leads
to the object*_property_add*() calls, which is the main problem
on most cases.
