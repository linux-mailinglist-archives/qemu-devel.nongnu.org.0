Ah I see, thanks for the pointer.  Then I would agree it's fine.

I'm not an expert of TCG - I'm curious on why all those three dirty
bitmaps need to be set at the very beginning.  IIUC at least the VGA
bitmap should not require that (so IMHO we should be fine to have all
zeros with VGA bitmap for ramblocks, and we only set them when the
guest touches them).  Migration bitmap should be special somehow but I
don't know much on TCG/TLB part I'd confess so I can't say.  In other
words, if migration is the only one that requires this "all-1"
initialization then IMHO we may consider to remove the other part
rather than here in migration because that's what we'd better to be
sure with.

And even if you want to remove this, I still have two suggestions:

(1) proper comment here above bmap on the above fact that although
    bmap is not set here but it's actually set somewhere else because
    we'll sooner or later copy all 1s from the ramblock bitmap

(2) imho you can move "migration_dirty_pages = 0" into
    ram_list_init_bitmaps() too to let them be together
