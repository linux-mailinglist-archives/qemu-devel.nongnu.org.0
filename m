Our primary concern is big endian cpu and little endian virtio because
virto 1.0 or better. But since we talk about a lib here, everything is
possible.

The problem is that AFAIK there is no way to figure out what is the right
thing at the moment. I guess QEMU should now, but not virtiofsd or
whatever userspace virtio device. But I will double check if there is
something in the protocol addressing this.
