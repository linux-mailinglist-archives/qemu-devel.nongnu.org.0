Currently, yes, that=E2=80=99s the closest we have to a well-defined langua=
ge,
I pointed it out in my mail, and there is qapi-code-gen.txt to prove it.

So it would certainly make sense for the language I=E2=80=99m describing to
be a forward evolution of QAPI, or something that is trivially transformed
to / from the existing json schema.

> The problem is that we're not even close to using QAPI for everything.

That=E2=80=99s the symptom of the problem. The problem as I see it is that
we could not. at least not with today=E2=80=99s QAPI (maybe I=E2=80=99m wro=
ng).
A good example is shortcut command-line options. I don=E2=80=99t think
you can, today, derive a user-friendly command-line syntax from
qapi-schema.json, and even less so one that is compatible with what
we have today.

> Adding a new language on top of QAPI instead isn't going to make the
> conversion process any faster.

I fully agree that whatever language we select has to have an easy,
systematic forward path from QAPI, but also from the other
existing meta-languages, like the .def files used for options,
or build configuration (there is a hint of the connection between
the two in the option =E2=80=98if=E2=80=99 member in the .json files).

In other words, the language I have in mind would be something
that I could auto-generate from, say, the current qapi-schema.json
and the qemu-options.def. Maybe in the end, that would be simply
by having qemu-options.def being used to build qemu-options.json,
and then add the relevant entries in qemu-options.json. Maybe
there is a better way.

Not really, IMO, in the sense that it gives me no clue as to how -hda
or -device relate to it.

An important point that you raise through your response, though, is
that the QAPI schema is only an IDL (interface definition language).
In other words, it can tell me what a BlockdevOptions look like on
the wire, but at least in the current state, it cannot tell me what happens
with it.

This is probably a good thing (it=E2=80=99s already complicated enough as i=
s),
but it=E2=80=99s worth pointing out that, even sticking to a declarative la=
nguage,
one could add constraints, as hinted by HAS_ARG in the .def file
(but we could have a richer constraints language, e.g. describing
-m option so that there can be at most one, the arg is a number,
can=E2=80=99t be negative or floating-point, and so on.

And of course, we could decide to not stick to a declarative language,
but to have a way to have some, possibly limited, processing
described in the language. I=E2=80=99m thinking notably of what is called
=E2=80=9Cdesugaring=E2=80=9D in other threads.

Agreed. As I said, that=E2=80=99s a symptom that QAPI is not the language
I am talking about, but at best a subset of it.

Well, I stick to three, because one option has a test and an exit(1),
and the other does not. Which is the kind of inconsistencies a
well-defined language would get rid of.

I would love that too :-)

Probably, but also because QAPI does not address the needs of

That=E2=80=99s close enough to me. (In my mind, that part was already =E2=

by QAPI, even if in the convoluted way you describe)

Or maybe extend the language so that it=E2=80=99s internal semantics
knows about this aspect of QOM?

I agree, my phrasing was poor. What I meant is that the language in
question should include a user-convenience dimension that is
not necessary (and not present) in QAPI. Agree the details are not
fundamental, I meant them as an illustration.

Well, except for purposefully trying to use a different wording to avoid
the risk of getting your mind stuck in one of the particular existing
meta-languages in QEMU, the approach is not very different.

- Relations already exist in QAPI for example: =E2=80=99struct=E2=80=99, =
=E2=80=98union=E2=80=99, =E2=80=98alternate=E2=80=99

- States exist, today represented using JSON

- Verbs are called =E2=80=9Ccommands=E2=80=9D in the QAPI json files, and a=
re what
follows DEF( in the .def file

- Transactions do not exist today that I know of, although we see
signs of them in discussions about the fact that this options destroys
that back end but that option does not.

It=E2=80=99s not intended to provide more, but to require less to do the sa=
