I can't get everything happy O:-)
For the multifd initial packet, I used to have that I wrote the fields
by hand.  Then danp asked that I used a packed struct, and converted the
values inside it.  So ..... Imposible to have everybody happy.

Anyways, the struct is packed, both sides are i386 32bits, and it should
be exactly the same, but it appears that there is where your valgrind
problems appear.  Still investigating _where_ the problem is.  What is
even weirder is that there is no error at all on 64bits.

Thanks, Juan.

PS.  BTW, did you launched by hand the guests with valgrind, or there is
     a trick that I am missing for launching a qtest with valgrind?
