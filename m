Yeah, I meant we should map virtio-video commands to a set of
abstracted userspace APIs to avoid having many platform-dependent code
in QEMU.
This is the same with what we implemented in crosvm, a VMM on
ChromiumOS. Crosvm's video device translates virtio-video commands
into our own video decoding APIs [1, 2] which supports VAAPI, V4L2
stateful and V4L2 stateless. Unfortunately, since our library is
highly depending on Chrome, we cannot reuse this for QEMU.

So, I agree that using FFMPEG or GStreamer is a good idea. Probably,
APIs in my previous link weren't for this purpose.
Nicolas, do you know any good references for FFMPEG or GStreamer's
abstracted video decoding APIs? Then, I may be able to think about how
virtio-video protocols can be mapped to them.
