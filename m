I think we're talking about different things. It's not about the data 
structure, it's about whether to data that reads from kernel can be 
understood by userspace.

I think not. They are bytecodes that have

1) strict ABI definitions
2) understood by userspace

I may miss something. I think we're talking about cross vendor live 
migration.

Would you want src and dest have same UUID or not?

If they have different UUIDs, how could we know we can live migrate 
between them.

If they have the same UUID, what's the rule of forcing the the vendors 
to choose same UUID (a spec)?

Thanks
