Why would you care about the size of the registers as passed by default?  You
shouldn't need or want to change that default to make gdbstub work.

The gdbstub should be passing along the vq value (via the "vg" pseudo-register,
iirc), and gdb should be working out what to display based on that.

If that isn't happening, and you are only changing the default so that gdb
quits displaying massive registers when they aren't in use, then you're doing
something wrong with gdb and gdbstub.
