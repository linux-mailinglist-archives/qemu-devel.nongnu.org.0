Maybe Patchew should ping these after 14 days or so.

That=E2=80=99s about the only thing I can contribute, because I don=E2=80=
=99t really use
Patchew myself...  I keep patches in a subfolder of my inbox on unread;
and I keep my own pending series in a separate folder.  (Before I did
that, I was much more prone to forgetting my own patches rather than
someone else=E2=80=99s.)
