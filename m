I agree on those.  (Maybe not 040, but definitely 030 and 041.)

Maybe one of the issues was the =E2=80=9Cpath too long=E2=80=9D thing for=
 Unix sockets?

I=E2=80=99d like a test for iothreads, it doesn=E2=80=99t look like there=
 currently is
one in auto.  (The problem of course is that they have a higher chance
of being flaky, but I think they also have a higher probability of
breaking because of non-block stuff.)

127 and 256 look promising to me.


Also, I don=E2=80=99t see any migration tests in auto (156 doesn=E2=80=99=
t really count).

The ones that looks interesting here are 091, 181 (but I seem to
remember that 181 is flaky under load, I should investigate that), 183,
and 203 (which also tests iothreads).


Those are the two area that I spontaneously think of when considering
what is more likely to be broken by non-block patches.  Unfortunately,
those are also the two areas with the tests that tend to be the
flakiest, I guess...

The difference is that the iotests generally seem much less
deterministic to me than the other tests we have.

Well, we=E2=80=99ll see how it goes.  I suppose in practice it won=E2=80=99=
t be too big
of a problem to just temporarily remove tests from auto if the issue
isn=E2=80=99t clear immediately but the test does seem important.  (I don=
=E2=80=99t
think there=E2=80=99s too much danger of forgetting them.)

That was my point, that we have tried.  It isn=E2=80=99t like we=E2=80=99=
ve failed, it=E2=80=99s
just that it looks like a never-ending mission to me.

And it isn=E2=80=99t like I=E2=80=99m not working on improving the situat=
ion, even when
I=E2=80=99m saying that I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99ll ever be perfe=

Waiting for another failure sounds OK to me.  (OTOH, 130 doesn=E2=80=99t =
seem
like something that needs to be in auto, in case we want to take
something out to save time for more important tests.)

But that reminds me that iotest failures probably should be
automatically signaled to me and Kevin instead of Peter having to write
an email himself.  Would that be possible?
