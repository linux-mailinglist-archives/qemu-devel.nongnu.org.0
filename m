Title:
  QEMU 5.0: Guest VM hangs/freeze when unplugging USB device

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Setup:

  Host: Debian/SID, Kernel 5.6, QEMU 5.0
  Guest: Windows 10 VM with PCI and USB device passthrough.

  Problem: Guest VM suddenly hangs when pulling USB device out from the
  Host.

  Observations:
   - Issue appears to be related to QEMU 5.0
     - It started after an upgrade to QEMU 5.0.
     - Downgrading only QEMU on multiple systems fixes the issue.

   - Issue is very reproducible.
     - Most of the time within a few attempts of pulling/reconnecting the d=
evice.
     - Issue happens with multiple devices (I did try standard HID devices,=
 a webcam and an x-ray sensor).

   - Guest just hangs.
     - Display output remains on last frame shown.
     - Ping to Guest immediately stops working.
     - Logs in the Guest stop logging immediately.

   - Host is fine and thinks the Guest is fine. =

     - Guest continues to show as running in "virsh list".
     - No suspicious entries in the QEMU logs.
     - No suspicious entries in Host syslogs/messages.
     - Host can can kill guest "virsh destroy" and respawn fine.

   - Issue seems widespread.
     - Multiple similar reports from ProxMox users after upgrade to ProxMox=
 6.2 for both Windows and Linux guests (First version that uses QEMU 5.0)

  I'd be more than happy any debugs that might be helpful.
