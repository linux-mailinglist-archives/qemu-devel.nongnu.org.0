As discussed here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg00697.html

and here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg01388.html

it would be good to have some more valuable iotests enabled in the
"auto" group to get better iotest coverage during "make check".

And once Max' "iotests: Add and use $SOCK_DIR" patch series has been
merged, we can indeed enable these Python-based tests, too.

There is just one small downside: Since these tests require a QEMU
that features a 'virtio-blk' device, we cannot run the iotests
with binaries like qemu-system-tricore anymore. But since the iotests
were not very useful with such binaries anyway, I think it's ok now
if we skip them there.

  iotests: remove 'linux' from default supported platforms

  iotests: Test 041 does not work on macOS
  iotests: Test 183 does not work on macOS and OpenBSD
  iotests: Skip "make check-block" if QEMU does not support virtio-blk
  iotests: Enable more tests in the 'auto' group to improve test
    coverage
