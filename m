I decide to do this because I was looking for the best place to add a
reference to a document on semihosting and there didn't seem to be
an obvious place to do this. To do this I took the original pre-amble
to the about index and moved it to its own section, expanding the
description and giving a quick high level overview of some of the key
feature of QEMU.

+Features
+========
+
+Virtualisation
+--------------
+
+The most common use case for QEMU is to provide a virtual model of a
+machine (CPU, memory and emulated devices) to run a guest OS. It
+supports a number of hypervisors (known as accelerators) as well as a
+dynamic JIT known as the Tiny Code Generator (TCG) capable of
+emulating many CPUs.
+
+.. list-table:: Supported Accelerators
+  :header-rows: 1

+
+.. [#tci] The Tiny Code Interpreter (TCI) can be used where there is no
+          explicit support for a processor backend. It will be even
+          slower than normal TCG guests.
+
+Related features
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+System emulation provides a wide range of device models to emulate
+various hardware components you may want to add to your machine. This
+includes a wide number of VirtIO devices which are specifically tuned
+for efficient operation under virtualisation. Some of the device
+emulation can be offloaded from the main QEMU process using either
+vhost-user (for VirtIO) or :ref:`Multi-process QEMU`. If the platform
+supports it QEMU also supports directly passing devices through to
+guest VMs to eliminate the device emulation overhead. See
+:ref:`device-emulation` for more details.
+
+There is a full featured block layer allows for construction of
+complex storage typologies which can be stacked across multiple layers
+supporting redirection, networking, snapshots and migration support.
+
+The flexible ``chardev`` system allows for handling IO from character
+like devices using stdio, files, unix sockets and TCP networking.
+
+QEMU provides a number of management interfaces including a line based
+Human Monitor Protocol (HMP) that allows you to dynamically add and
+remove devices as well as introspect the system state. The QEMU
+Monitor Protocol (QMP) is a well defined, versioned, machine usable
+API that presents a rich interface to other tools to create, control
+and manage Virtual Machines. This is the interface used by higher
+level tools interfaces such as `Virt Manager
+<https://virt-manager.org/>`_ using the `libvirt framework
+<https://libvirt.org>`_. Using some sort of management layer to
+configure complex QEMU setups is recommended.
+
+For the common accelerators QEMU supported debugging with its
+:ref:`gdbstub<GDB usage>` which allows users to connect GDB and debug
+system software images.
+
+See the :ref:`System Emulation` section of the manual for full details
+of how to run QEMU as a VMM.
+
+Emulation
+---------
+
+As alluded to above QEMU's Tiny Code Generator (TCG) also has the
+ability to emulate a number of CPU architectures on any supported
+platform. This can either be using full system emulation or using its
+"user mode emulation" support to run user space processes compiled for
+one CPU on another CPU.
+
+See `User Mode Emulation` for more details on running in this mode.

+
+Semihosting
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A number of guest architecture support semihosting which provides a
+way for guest programs to access the host system though a POSIX-like
+system call layer. This has applications for early software bring-up
+making it easy for a guest to dump data or read configuration files
+before a full operating system is implemented.
+
+Some of those guest architectures also support semihosting in
+user-mode making the testing of "bare-metal" micro-controller code
+easy in a user-mode environment that doesn't have a full libc port.
+
+Deterministic Execution with Record/Replay
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+For system emulation QEMU offers a execution mode called ``icount``
+which allows for guest time to be purely a function of the number of
+instructions executed. Combined with snapshots and a logging of HW
+events a deterministic execution can be recorded and played back at
+will.
+
+gdbstub
+~~~~~~~
+
+Under emulation the :ref:`gdbstub<GDB usage>` is fully supported and
+takes advantage of the implementation to support unlimited breakpoints
+in the guest code. For system emulation we also support an unlimited
+number of memory based watchpoints as well as integration with
+record/replay to support reverse debugging.
+
+
+TCG Plugins
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In any emulation execution mode you can write :ref:`TCG Plugins` which
+can instrument the guest code as it executes to a per-instruction
+granularity. This is useful for writing tools to analyse the real
+world execution behaviour of your programs.
+
+Tools
+-----
+
+QEMU also provides a number of standalone commandline utilities, such
+as the ``qemu-img`` disk image utility that allows you to create,
+convert and modify disk images. While most are expected to be used in
+conjunction with QEMU itself some can also be used with other VMMs
+that support the same interfaces.
+
+See :ref:`Tools` for more details.

 QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
 
-QEMU can be used in several different ways. The most common is for
-"system emulation", where it provides a virtual model of an
-entire machine (CPU, memory and emulated devices) to run a guest OS.
-In this mode the CPU may be fully emulated, or it may work with
-a hypervisor such as KVM, Xen, Hax or Hypervisor.Framework to
-allow the guest to run directly on the host CPU.
-
-The second supported way to use QEMU is "user mode emulation",
-where QEMU can launch processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.
-In this mode the CPU is always emulated.
-
-QEMU also provides a number of standalone commandline utilities,
-such as the ``qemu-img`` disk image utility that allows you to create,
-convert and modify disk images.
