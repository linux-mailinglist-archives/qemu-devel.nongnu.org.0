I think there could be two approaches:

1) record the device in MR as Qiang mentioned
2) Only forbid the reentrancy in MMIO handler and depends on the device 
to solve the multiple Memory Region issue, if the regions want to access 
the same data, it needs to be synchronized internally

But the point is still to try to solve it in the layer of memory 
regions. Otherwise we may still hit similar issues.

Yes, it needs more thought, but as a first step, we can try to fix the 
MMIO handler issue and do bh fix on top.
