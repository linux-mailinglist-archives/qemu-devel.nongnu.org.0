No, in the short term we want to have tests that can respond to a
number of well known parameters, such as "accel".  But to actually
have tests (names) that are meaningful enough, we need to:

 1) Add a varianter implementation (or usage)
 2) Drop the duplicate tests

#1 is needed because:

 a) it doesn't feel right to name tests based on simple command
    line parameters (the ones given with -p, say, "-p accel=kvm"
    will add to the test name "accel_kvm".

 b) a variant *name* is added to the test ID, which then can be
    kept consistent.

Then we can proceed to #2, and drop the duplicate tests, say:

 - test_x86_64_pc, test_x86_64_pc_kvm => test_x86_64_pc

On a further iteration, it may even make sense to consolidate:

 - test_x86_64_pc, test_x86_64_q35 => test_x86_64

Time will tell.

Yes, the new implementation of the Varianter CIT is now generally
available on Avocado 70.0, so I'm working on a file that hopefully
will suite the acceptance tests.
