I'd say this is the scenario that wil lapply long term. As we aim
for a world where you can run "qemu -qmp unix:/tmp/sock,server"
and then configure everything over QMP, we should cease to have
any scenarios where stuff is missing from query-qmp-schemas,
as we'll have a QMP command that covers everything.

IOW, in this case we really ought to have a 'audiodev-add'
command as a counterpart to -audiodev CLI. Not sure if there

are any dragons wrt to creating audio backends on the fly.

I figure having a 'query-foo' QMP corresponding to any 'foo-add' QMP
is useful as a general rule to allow mgmt (or human support engineers)
to inspect an running instance and understand its configuration,
especially since it won't be visible in CLI args if we move to 100%
QMP based config.

On the libvirt side we only need it for enabling introspection.

As a general rule, being able to inspect any aspect of configuration
via QMP is useful for support purposes if nothing else.
