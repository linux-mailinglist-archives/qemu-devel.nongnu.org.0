In principle that sounds good, but it doesn't work that way, and can't
with anything resembling the current model.  The user can't specify a
specific interrupt mode to be used, they can only specify what modes
will be available to the guest, and "dual" means *both* are available.

Otherwise we will get inconsistent behaviour - potentially triggering
different guest bugs - on what's allegedly the same qemu
configuration. It gets worse if you consider edge cases like migrating
between the initial machine setup and CAS

This should be as per "xive" - emul, emul, error (assuming POWER9 and
a a xive capable guest).  Otherwise we're presenting different guest
environments to the guest based on something that's not visible in the
qemu parameters.

We've done that a bunch of times in the past, and many of them have
bitten us in the arse later on.

PAPR option negotiation via CAS is already confusing, with just the
guest and qemu as participants.  If the host kernel is also a
participant it's just asking for hard to reproduce bugs.

If we were designing the whole environment from scratch, maybe.  But
the way things work at the moment, negotiation between qemu and the
host kernel and qemu and the guest kernel must be separate phases.
That makes the priority you describe impossible.
