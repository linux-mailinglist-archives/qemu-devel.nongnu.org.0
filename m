So far we have only sufficiently similar boards that can share the only 
magic function. Not many boards use SPD data (these are mostly needed for 
real board firmware so anything purely virtual don't model it usually). 
The refactoring you propose could be needed if we had more dissimilar 
boards but I think we could do that at that time. Until then I've tried to 
make it simple for board code and put all magic in one place instead of 
having separate implementation of this in several boards. Maybe someone 
should try to convert the remaining boards (MIPS Malta and ARM 
integratorcp) to see if any refactoring is needed before doing those 
refactoring without checking first what's needed. I did not try to convert 
those boards because I cannot test them.

Sorry, I may have forgotten it by the time I was refactorig commits for 
submission.
