This series adds NVDIMM support to arm/virt platform.
The series reuses some of the patches posted by Eric
in his earlier attempt here[1].

This also include few fixes to qemu in general which were
discovered while adding nvdimm support to arm/virt.

Patch #2 addresses the issue[2] that, during migration, the 
source and destination might end up with an inconsistency
in acpi table memory region sizes.

Patch #3 is to fix the qemu_ram_resize() callback issue[2].

Patch #4 is another fix to the nvdimm aml issue discussed
here[3].

I have done a basic sanity testing of NVDIMM devices
with Guest booting with ACPI. Further testing is always
welcome.

Please let me know your feedback.

Thanks,
Shameer
