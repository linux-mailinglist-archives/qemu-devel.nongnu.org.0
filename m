From: Andrea Bolognani <abologna@redhat.com>

The current documentation is fairly terse and not easy to decode
for someone who's not intimately familiar with the inner workings
of timer devices. Expand on it by providing a somewhat verbose
description of what behavior each policy will result in, as seen
from both the guest OS and host point of view.
