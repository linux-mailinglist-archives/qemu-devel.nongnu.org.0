Correct, a guest could pretty reliably determine this information
anyway based on the PVR. It can't account for a POWER8 operating in
split core mode, but I don't know any harm that could be done by
introducing this information.

Additionally it doesn't really tell you anything about how you're going
to be scheduled (at least on POWER9) since vcpus are scheduled on a per
thread, not per core basis.

This isn't documented in papr, it has been decided that this is how the
information will be communicated to a guest. This is the most
appropriate place to put this information and the HostThrs name is
consistent with the naming of other information in this property.

We have other non-papr information in qemu, for example hcall numbers,
so this isn't exactly a precedent.

RTAS services are defined as being provided by a papr platform, and the
existence of the ibm,ppc-interrupt-server#s device tree property is a
requirement of a papr platform. So I don't see this being an issue.

This is essentially catching the error case of
rtas_get_num_host_threads() returning a negative number or not finding
the required properties (which as mentioned above are required). The
KVM-PR case will work the same as the KVM-HV case where the host device
tree will be queried. For TCG we just default to 1 since this
information shouldn't be relevant to a TCG guest.
