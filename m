I guess fair enough. This syntax is so generic (hence complex), that
its not my first choice. But if others feel the need of such a 
generic mechanism, I am not going to get in the way.

Fair enough. Yes, we will have to block this as part of "remap_xattr"
semantics.

I will be nice to avoid knowing level information because it is
ugly. But how to avoid it? Either don't use virtiofs in stacking
configurations. But if we have to, how to avoid it?

We can allow specifying multiple "remap_xattr" or allow multiple
rules in single option separted by ":".

Say -o remap_xattr="security.selinux.:trusted."

Yes. I could not find a way to avoid it.

Right that should work. But this will prefix user.virtiofs for every
xattr. If we want to prefix it on a specific xattr, then it become
little more tricky. Because inner most layer will do
setxattr(trusted.foo.) and next layer will do
setxattr(user.virtiofs.trusted.foo). So question is what's the common
syntax which works for both.


I have been thinking little more of nested overlay use case.

If we make sure that "upper" for each overlay instance is
separate (and not coming from stacked overlay), then following should
work well for nested configurations.

To reiterate, I think something like this should work for nested
overlay configuration.

- On host, create lower0, upper0, upper1 and upper2 dirs.
  
  mkdir -p lower0 lower0/lower1 work0 upper1 work1 upper2 work2 ovl0

- Create ovl0 on host (L0)

  mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=lower0,upperdir=upper0,workdir=work0 none ovl0 
  
- Bind mount upper and work dirs for ovl1 and ovl2.

  mkdir -p ovl0/upper1 ovl0/work1 ovl0/upper2 ovl0/work2
  mount --bind upper1 ovl0/upper1
  mount --bind work1 ovl0/work1
  mount --bind upper2 ovl0/upper2
  mount --bind work2 ovl0/work2

- Run virtiofsd0 on ovl0 with "-o remap_xattr="trusted.overlay."

- Inside L1 guest say ovl0 is mounted at "/". Create second overlay.

  mkdir ovl1
  mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=lower1,upperdir=upper1,workdir=work1 none ovl1

- Bind mount upper2 and work2 inside ovl1.

  mkdir -p ovl1/upper2 ovl1/work2
  mount --bind upper2 ovl1/upper2
  mount --bind work2 ovl1/work2

- Run virtiofsd1 on ovl1 with -o "remap_xattr="trusted.overlay."

- Inisde L2 guest say virtiofs is mounted at "/"

  mkdir ovl2
  mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=lower1,upperdir=upper2,workdir=work2 none ovl2

  Now upper for overlayfs are not stacked through overlayfs file systems.
