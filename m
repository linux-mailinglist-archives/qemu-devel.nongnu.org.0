Good point.

And conversely, there are a few test cases that I do know (like 026 030
040 041 055) and probably wouldn't recognise for a while after a rename.

I guess a final patch to rename the directory as an RFC makes sense.
Then we can continue the discussion there and decide whether or not to
apply it without holding up the rest of the series.

I think I would be inclined to leave the name unchanged as long as we
don't have a real reason, but if people overwhelmingly think otherwise,
we can still rename.
