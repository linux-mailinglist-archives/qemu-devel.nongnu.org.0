I think I could successfully undertake majority of the tasks you mentioned
(l am not certain on build tests only, since I most probably don=CB=8At hav=
e the
test equipment that is versatile enough and I am not sure how Github CI
works).

In any case, I admire your handling this heavy burden so far, and wish we
continue making QEMU better every year.

Aleksandar
