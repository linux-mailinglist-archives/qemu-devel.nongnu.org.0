You might find the user-mode qemu-arm sufficient for that
kind of thing. I know some gcc tests run that way. You
get a processor, semihosting, and whatever memory your
ELF file's data segment says you have (plus anything
you care to mmap()).

Sure, but "machine-that-works-for-keith-packard" isn't really
a very clearly-defined concept :-)

I think that trying to weld M-profile into the A-profile virt
board is likely to be more confusing than having a separate board.
But I remain unhappy about defining a virtual board at all
if I can avoid it.
