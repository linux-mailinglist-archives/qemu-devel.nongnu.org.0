The gdb test would be better served in docs/core if we could have
optional sections on invocation rendering depending on if it's built
with system emulation or linux-user docs. Is that something that's
already supported?

Anyway not holding this up:

 This means you may hit the same breakpoint a number of times before execut=

> +@section Inter-VM Shared Memory device
> +
> +On Linux hosts, a shared memory device is available.  The basic syntax
> +is:
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system_x86} -device ivshmem-plain,memdev=3D@var{hostmem}
> +@end example
> +
> +where @var{hostmem} names a host memory backend.  For a POSIX shared
> +memory backend, use something like
> +
> +@example
> +-object memory-backend-file,size=3D1M,share,mem-path=3D/dev/shm/ivshmem,=
id=3D@var{hostmem}
> +@end example
> +
> +If desired, interrupts can be sent between guest VMs accessing the same =
shared
> +memory region.  Interrupt support requires using a shared memory server =
and
> +using a chardev socket to connect to it.  The code for the shared memory=
 server
> +is qemu.git/contrib/ivshmem-server.  An example syntax when using the sh=
ared
> +memory server is:
> +
> +@example
> +# First start the ivshmem server once and for all
> +ivshmem-server -p @var{pidfile} -S @var{path} -m @var{shm-name} -l @var{=
shm-size} -n @var{vectors}

> +                 -chardev socket,path=3D@var{path},id=3D@var{id}
> +@end example
> +
> +When using the server, the guest will be assigned a VM ID (>=3D0) that a=
llows guests
> +using the same server to communicate via interrupts.  Guests can read th=
eir
> +VM ID from a device register (see ivshmem-spec.txt).
> +
> +@subsection Migration with ivshmem
> +
> +With device property @option{master=3Don}, the guest will copy the shared
> +memory on migration to the destination host.  With @option{master=3Doff},
> +the guest will not be able to migrate with the device attached.  In the
> +latter case, the device should be detached and then reattached after
> +migration using the PCI hotplug support.
> +
> +At most one of the devices sharing the same memory can be master.  The
> +master must complete migration before you plug back the other devices.
> +
> +@subsection ivshmem and hugepages
> +
> +Instead of specifying the <shm size> using POSIX shm, you may specify
> +a memory backend that has hugepage support:

> +Almost all network services in QEMU have the ability to use TLS for
> +session data encryption, along with x509 certificates for simple
> +client authentication. What follows is a description of how to
> +generate certificates suitable for usage with QEMU, and applies to
> +the VNC server, character devices with the TCP backend, NBD server
> +and client, and migration server and client.
> +
> +At a high level, QEMU requires certificates and private keys to be
> +provided in PEM format. Aside from the core fields, the certificates
> +should include various extension data sets, including v3 basic
> +constraints data, key purpose, key usage and subject alt name.
> +
> +The GnuTLS package includes a command called @code{certtool} which can
> +be used to easily generate certificates and keys in the required format
> +with expected data present. Alternatively a certificate management
> +service may be used.
> +
> +At a minimum it is necessary to setup a certificate authority, and
> +issue certificates to each server. If using x509 certificates for
> +authentication, then each client will also need to be issued a
> +certificate.
> +
> +Assuming that the QEMU network services will only ever be exposed to
> +clients on a private intranet, there is no need to use a commercial
> +certificate authority to create certificates. A self-signed CA is
> +sufficient, and in fact likely to be more secure since it removes
> +the ability of malicious 3rd parties to trick the CA into mis-issuing
> +certs for impersonating your services. The only likely exception
> +where a commercial CA might be desirable is if enabling the VNC
> +websockets server and exposing it directly to remote browser clients.
> +In such a case it might be useful to use a commercial CA to avoid
> +needing to install custom CA certs in the web browsers.
> +
> +The recommendation is for the server to keep its certificates in either
> +@code{/etc/pki/qemu} or for unprivileged users in @code{$HOME/.pki/qemu}.

> +
> +@example
> +# certtool --generate-privkey > ca-key.pem
> +@end example
> +
> +To generate a self-signed certificate requires one core piece of informa=
tion,
> +the name of the organization. A template file @code{ca.info} should be
> +populated with the desired data to avoid having to deal with interactive

> +           --template ca.info \
> +           --outfile ca-cert.pem
> +@end example
> +
> +The @code{ca} keyword in the template sets the v3 basic constraints exte=
nsion
> +to indicate this certificate is for a CA, while @code{cert_signing_key} =
sets
> +the key usage extension to indicate this will be used for signing other =
keys.
> +The generated @code{ca-cert.pem} file should be copied to all servers and
> +clients wishing to utilize TLS support in the VNC server. The @code{ca-k=
ey.pem}
> +must not be disclosed/copied anywhere except the host responsible for is=

> +@subsection Issuing server certificates
> +
> +Each server (or host) needs to be issued with a key and certificate. Whe=
n connecting
> +the certificate is sent to the client which validates it against the CA =
certificate.
> +The core pieces of information for a server certificate are the hostname=
s and/or IP
> +addresses that will be used by clients when connecting. The hostname / I=
P address
> +that the client specifies when connecting will be validated against the =
hostname(s)
> +and IP address(es) recorded in the server certificate, and if no match i=
s found
> +the client will close the connection.
> +
> +Thus it is recommended that the server certificate include both the full=
y qualified
> +and unqualified hostnames. If the server will have permanently assigned =
IP address(es),
> +and clients are likely to use them when connecting, they may also be inc=
luded in the
> +certificate. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported. Historically ce=
rtificates
> +only included 1 hostname in the @code{CN} field, however, usage of this =
field for

gainst the
> +Subject Alt Name extension data, which allows for multiple entries. In t=
he future
> +usage of the @code{CN} field may be discontinued entirely, so providing =
SAN

> +@subsection Without passwords
> +
> +The simplest VNC server setup does not include any form of authenticatio=
n.
> +For this setup it is recommended to restrict it to listen on a UNIX doma=
in
> +socket only. For example
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system} [...OPTIONS...] -vnc unix:/home/joebloggs/.qemu-myvm=
-vnc
> +@end example
> +
> +This ensures that only users on local box with read/write access to that
> +path can access the VNC server. To securely access the VNC server from a
> +remote machine, a combination of netcat+ssh can be used to provide a sec=
ure
> +tunnel.
> +
> +@node vnc_sec_password
> +@subsection With passwords
> +
> +The VNC protocol has limited support for password based authentication. =
Since
> +the protocol limits passwords to 8 characters it should not be considered
> +to provide high security. The password can be fairly easily brute-forced=
 by
> +a client making repeat connections. For this reason, a VNC server using =
password
> +authentication should be restricted to only listen on the loopback inter=
face
> +or UNIX domain sockets. Password authentication is not supported when op=
erating
> +in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode as it requires the use of the DES cipher. =
Password
> +authentication is requested with the @code{password} option, and then on=
ce QEMU
> +is running the password is set with the monitor. Until the monitor is us=
ed to
> +set the password all clients will be rejected.
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system} [...OPTIONS...] -vnc :1,password -monitor stdio
> +(qemu) change vnc password
> +Password: ********
> +(qemu)
> +@end example
> +
> +@node vnc_sec_certificate
> +@subsection With x509 certificates
> +
> +The QEMU VNC server also implements the VeNCrypt extension allowing use =
of
> +TLS for encryption of the session, and x509 certificates for authenticat=
ion.
> +The use of x509 certificates is strongly recommended, because TLS on its
> +own is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Basic x509 certificate
> +support provides a secure session, but no authentication. This allows any
> +client to connect, and provides an encrypted session.
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system} [...OPTIONS...] \
> +  -object tls-creds-x509,id=3Dtls0,dir=3D/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=3Dserver=
,verify-peer=3Dno \
> +  -vnc :1,tls-creds=3Dtls0 -monitor stdio
> +@end example
> +
> +In the above example @code{/etc/pki/qemu} should contain at least three =
files,
> +@code{ca-cert.pem}, @code{server-cert.pem} and @code{server-key.pem}. Un=
privileged
> +users will want to use a private directory, for example @code{$HOME/.pki=
/qemu}.
> +NB the @code{server-key.pem} file should be protected with file mode 060=
0 to
> +only be readable by the user owning it.
> +
> +@node vnc_sec_certificate_verify
> +@subsection With x509 certificates and client verification
> +
> +Certificates can also provide a means to authenticate the client connect=
ing.
> +The server will request that the client provide a certificate, which it =
will
> +then validate against the CA certificate. This is a good choice if deplo=
ying
> +in an environment with a private internal certificate authority. It uses=
 the
> +same syntax as previously, but with @code{verify-peer} set to @code{yes}
> +instead.
> +
> +@example

> +
> +@node vnc_sec_certificate_pw
> +@subsection With x509 certificates, client verification and passwords
> +
> +Finally, the previous method can be combined with VNC password authentic=
ation
> +to provide two layers of authentication for clients.
> +

> +(qemu)
> +@end example
> +
> +
> +@node vnc_sec_sasl
> +@subsection With SASL authentication
> +
> +The SASL authentication method is a VNC extension, that provides an
> +easily extendable, pluggable authentication method. This allows for
> +integration with a wide range of authentication mechanisms, such as
> +PAM, GSSAPI/Kerberos, LDAP, SQL databases, one-time keys and more.
> +The strength of the authentication depends on the exact mechanism
> +configured. If the chosen mechanism also provides a SSF layer, then
> +it will encrypt the datastream as well.
> +
> +Refer to the later docs on how to choose the exact SASL mechanism
> +used for authentication, but assuming use of one supporting SSF,
> +then QEMU can be launched with:
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system} [...OPTIONS...] -vnc :1,sasl -monitor stdio
> +@end example
> +
> +@node vnc_sec_certificate_sasl
> +@subsection With x509 certificates and SASL authentication
> +
> +If the desired SASL authentication mechanism does not supported
> +SSF layers, then it is strongly advised to run it in combination
> +with TLS and x509 certificates. This provides securely encrypted
> +data stream, avoiding risk of compromising of the security
> +credentials. This can be enabled, by combining the 'sasl' option
> +with the aforementioned TLS + x509 options:
> +
> +@example
> +@value{qemu_system} [...OPTIONS...] \
> +  -object tls-creds-x509,id=3Dtls0,dir=3D/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=3Dserver=
,verify-peer=3Dyes \
> +  -vnc :1,tls-creds=3Dtls0,sasl -monitor stdio
> +@end example
> +
> +@node vnc_setup_sasl
> +
> +@subsection Configuring SASL mechanisms
> +
> +The following documentation assumes use of the Cyrus SASL implementation=
 on a
> +Linux host, but the principles should apply to any other SASL implementa=
tion
> +or host. When SASL is enabled, the mechanism configuration will be loade=
d from
> +system default SASL service config /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running QEMU=
 as an
> +unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used to=
 make
> +it search alternate locations for the service config file.
> +
> +If the TLS option is enabled for VNC, then it will provide session encry=
ption,
> +otherwise the SASL mechanism will have to provide encryption. In the lat=
ter
> +case the list of possible plugins that can be used is drastically reduce=
d. In
> +fact only the GSSAPI SASL mechanism provides an acceptable level of secu=
rity
> +by modern standards. Previous versions of QEMU referred to the DIGEST-MD5
> +mechanism, however, it has multiple serious flaws described in detail in
> +RFC 6331 and thus should never be used any more. The SCRAM-SHA-1 mechani=
sm
> +provides a simple username/password auth facility similar to DIGEST-MD5,=
 but
> +does not support session encryption, so can only be used in combination =
with
> +TLS.
> +
> +When not using TLS the recommended configuration is
> +
> +@example
> +mech_list: gssapi
> +keytab: /etc/qemu/krb5.tab
> +@end example
> +
> +This says to use the 'GSSAPI' mechanism with the Kerberos v5 protocol, w=
ith
> +the server principal stored in /etc/qemu/krb5.tab. For this to work the
> +administrator of your KDC must generate a Kerberos principal for the ser=
ver,
> +with a name of 'qemu/somehost.example.com@@EXAMPLE.COM' replacing
> +'somehost.example.com' with the fully qualified host name of the machine
> +running QEMU, and 'EXAMPLE.COM' with the Kerberos Realm.
> +
> +When using TLS, if username+password authentication is desired, then a
> +reasonable configuration is
> +
> +@example
> +mech_list: scram-sha-1
> +sasldb_path: /etc/qemu/passwd.db
> +@end example
> +
> +The @code{saslpasswd2} program can be used to populate the @code{passwd.=
db}
> +file with accounts.
> +
> +Other SASL configurations will be left as an exercise for the reader. No=
te that
> +all mechanisms, except GSSAPI, should be combined with use of TLS to ens=
ure a
> +secure data channel.

> -
> -QEMU can simulate several network cards (e.g. PCI or ISA cards on the PC
> -target) and can connect them to a network backend on the host or an emul=
ated
> -hub. The various host network backends can either be used to connect the=
 NIC of

ileged
> -user mode network stack), or to other guest instances running in another=
 QEMU
> -process (e.g. by using the socket host network backend).
> -
> -@subsection Using TAP network interfaces
> -
> -This is the standard way to connect QEMU to a real network. QEMU adds
> -a virtual network device on your host (called @code{tapN}), and you
> -can then configure it as if it was a real ethernet card.
> -
> -@subsubsection Linux host
> -
> -As an example, you can download the @file{linux-test-xxx.tar.gz}
> -archive and copy the script @file{qemu-ifup} in @file{/etc} and
> -configure properly @code{sudo} so that the command @code{ifconfig}
> -contained in @file{qemu-ifup} can be executed as root. You must verify

> -
> -See @ref{sec_invocation} to have examples of command lines using the

> -
> -@subsubsection Windows host
> -
> -There is a virtual ethernet driver for Windows 2000/XP systems, called
> -TAP-Win32. But it is not included in standard QEMU for Windows,
> -so you will need to get it separately. It is part of OpenVPN package,
> -so download OpenVPN from : @url{https://openvpn.net/}.
> -
> -@subsection Using the user mode network stack
> -
> -By using the option @option{-net user} (default configuration if no
> -@option{-net} option is specified), QEMU uses a completely user mode
> -network stack (you don't need root privilege to use the virtual
> -network). The virtual network configuration is the following:
> -
> -@example
> -
> -     guest (10.0.2.15)  <------>  Firewall/DHCP server <-----> Internet
> -                           |          (10.0.2.2)
> -                           |
> -                           ---->  DNS server (10.0.2.3)
> -                           |
> -                           ---->  SMB server (10.0.2.4)
> -@end example
> -
> -The QEMU VM behaves as if it was behind a firewall which blocks all
> -incoming connections. You can use a DHCP client to automatically
> -configure the network in the QEMU VM. The DHCP server assign addresses
> -to the hosts starting from 10.0.2.15.
> -
> -In order to check that the user mode network is working, you can ping
> -the address 10.0.2.2 and verify that you got an address in the range
> -10.0.2.x from the QEMU virtual DHCP server.
> -
> -Note that ICMP traffic in general does not work with user mode networkin=
g.
> -@code{ping}, aka. ICMP echo, to the local router (10.0.2.2) shall work,
> -however. If you're using QEMU on Linux >=3D 3.0, it can use unprivileged=
 ICMP
> -ping sockets to allow @code{ping} to the Internet. The host admin has to=
 set
> -the ping_group_range in order to grant access to those sockets. To allow=
 ping
> -for GID 100 (usually users group):
> -
> -@example
> -echo 100 100 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range
> -@end example
> -
> -When using the built-in TFTP server, the router is also the TFTP
> -server.
> -
> -When using the @option{'-netdev user,hostfwd=3D...'} option, TCP or UDP
> -connections can be redirected from the host to the guest. It allows for
> -example to redirect X11, telnet or SSH connections.
> -
> -@subsection Hubs
> -
> -QEMU can simulate several hubs. A hub can be thought of as a virtual con=
nection
> -between several network devices. These devices can be for example QEMU v=
irtual
> -ethernet cards or virtual Host ethernet devices (TAP devices). You can c=
onnect
> -guest NICs or host network backends to such a hub using the @option{-net=
dev
> -hubport} or @option{-nic hubport} options. The legacy @option{-net} opti=
on
> -also connects the given device to the emulated hub with ID 0 (i.e. the d=
efault
> -hub) unless you specify a netdev with @option{-net nic,netdev=3Dxxx} her=
e.
> -
> -@subsection Connecting emulated networks between QEMU instances
> -
> -Using the @option{-netdev socket} (or @option{-nic socket} or
> -@option{-net socket}) option, it is possible to create emulated
> -networks that span several QEMU instances.

> -and client, and migration server and client.
> -
> -At a high level, QEMU requires certificates and private keys to be
> -provided in PEM format. Aside from the core fields, the certificates
> -should include various extension data sets, including v3 basic
> -constraints data, key purpose, key usage and subject alt name.
> -
> -The GnuTLS package includes a command called @code{certtool} which can
> -be used to easily generate certificates and keys in the required format
> -with expected data present. Alternatively a certificate management
> -service may be used.
> -
> -At a minimum it is necessary to setup a certificate authority, and
> -issue certificates to each server. If using x509 certificates for
> -authentication, then each client will also need to be issued a
> -certificate.
> -
> -Assuming that the QEMU network services will only ever be exposed to
> -clients on a private intranet, there is no need to use a commercial
> -certificate authority to create certificates. A self-signed CA is
> -sufficient, and in fact likely to be more secure since it removes

> -certs for impersonating your services. The only likely exception
> -where a commercial CA might be desirable is if enabling the VNC
> -websockets server and exposing it directly to remote browser clients.
> -In such a case it might be useful to use a commercial CA to avoid
> -needing to install custom CA certs in the web browsers.
