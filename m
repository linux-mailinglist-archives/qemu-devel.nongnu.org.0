It may make sense even if we don't.  QAPI_LIST_ADD() leaves the reader
guessing whether we prepend or append.

Changes the C type we generate for a QAPI array from pointer to struct.

I'd expect the cost of reversing the list to be negligible.

Another option is to simply factor out the common part of the common way
to build a list by appending: "append to list, update tail pointer".
Similar to how QAPI_LIST_ADD() factors out the common "prepend to list,
update head pointer".

Definitely.

You're right.

I don't give a rat's ass about C++, actually.  I'm glad you got rid of
the tacit "@new points to the same type as @ret does".

Clean:

             new = g_malloc0(sizeof(*new));
             new = g_new0(GuestFilesystemInfoList, 1);

Clean (but I'd use g_new0() instead):

             new = g_malloc0(sizeof(GuestFilesystemInfoList));

Dirty:

             new = g_malloc0(sizeof(X));

where X is anything else.

One of us is blind, and it might be me :)

@list points to the first element (we return it, so it better does).

@cur_item is the new list node.

We set cut_item->next = list, and then list = cur_item.  Sure looks like
prepending to me.

Makes sense.

Holding the updated prepend part until the append part is ready for
posting might be unadvisable.  You decide.
