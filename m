This isn't. The object_property_set_bool() was later converted to
qdev_realize() (thanks again for the cleanups!) but the problem
remains. Realize can fail and I see now reason we don't do proper
error handling when it comes to the DRCs.

I'll look into fixing that.

Yes it does.

David,

Maybe consider folding a third Fixes: tag into this patch ?
