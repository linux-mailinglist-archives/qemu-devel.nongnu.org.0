This series aims to provide a better designed replacement for the=0D
savevm/loadvm/delvm HMP commands, which despite their flaws continue=0D
to be actively used in the QMP world via the HMP command passthrough=0D
facility.=0D
=0D
The main problems addressed are:=0D
=0D
 - The logic to pick which disk to store the vmstate in is not=0D
   satsifactory.=0D
=0D
   The first block driver state cannot be assumed to be the root disk=0D
   image, it might be OVMF varstore and we don't want to store vmstate=0D
   in there.=0D
=0D
 - The logic to decide which disks must be snapshotted is hardwired=0D
   to all disks which are writable=0D
=0D
   Again with OVMF there might be a writable varstore, but this can be=0D
   raw rather than qcow2 format, and thus unable to be snapshotted.=0D
   While users might wish to snapshot their varstore, in some/many/most=0D
   cases it is entirely uneccessary. Users are blocked from snapshotting=0D
   their VM though due to this varstore.=0D
=0D
 - The commands are synchronous blocking execution and returning=0D
   errors immediately.=0D
=0D
   This is partially addressed by integrating with the job framework.=0D
   This forces the client to use the async commands to determine=0D
   the completion status or error message from the operations.=0D
=0D
In the block code I've only dealt with node names for block devices, as=0D
IIUC, this is all that libvirt should need in the -blockdev world it now=0D
lives in. IOW, I've made not attempt to cope with people wanting to use=0D
these QMP commands in combination with -drive args, as libvirt will=0D
never use -drive with a QEMU new enough to have these new commands.=0D
=0D
The main limitations of this current impl=0D
=0D
 - The snapshot process runs serialized in the main thread. ie QEMU=0D
   guest execution is blocked for the duration. The job framework=0D
   lets us fix this in future without changing the QMP semantics=0D
   exposed to the apps.=0D
=0D
 - Most vmstate loading errors just go to stderr, as they are not=0D
   using Error **errp reporting. Thus the job framework just=0D
   reports a fairly generic message=0D
=0D
     "Error -22 while loading VM state"=0D
=0D
   Again this can be fixed later without changing the QMP semantics=0D
   exposed to apps.=0D
=0D
I've done some minimal work in libvirt to start to make use of the new=0D
commands to validate their functionality, but this isn't finished yet.=0D
=0D
My ultimate goal is to make the GNOME Boxes maintainer happy again by=0D
having internal snapshots work with OVMF:=0D
=0D

5e=3D=0D
f45c5f64048f16a6e=0D
=0D
Changed in v6:=0D
=0D
 - Resolve many conflicts with recent replay changes=0D
 - Misc typos in QAPI=0D
=0D
Changed in v5:=0D
=0D
 - Fix prevention of tag overwriting=0D
 - Refactor and expand test suite coverage to validate=0D
   more negative scenarios=0D
=0D
Changed in v4:=0D
=0D
 - Make the device lists mandatory, dropping all support for=0D
   QEMU's built-in heuristics to select devices.=0D
=0D
 - Improve some error reporting and I/O test coverage=0D
=0D
Changed in v3:=0D
=0D
 - Schedule a bottom half to escape from coroutine context in=0D
   the jobs. This is needed because the locking in the snapshot=0D
   code goes horribly wrong when run from a background coroutine=0D
   instead of the main event thread.=0D
=0D
 - Re-factor way we iterate over devices, so that we correctly=0D
   report non-existant devices passed by the user over QMP.=0D
=0D
 - Add QAPI docs notes about limitations wrt vmstate error=0D
   reporting (it all goes to stderr not an Error **errp)=0D
   so QMP only gets a fairly generic error message currently.=0D
=0D
 - Add I/O test to validate many usage scenarios / errors=0D
=0D
 - Add I/O test helpers to handle QMP events with a deterministic=0D
   ordering=0D
=0D
 - Ensure 'delete-snapshot' reports an error if requesting=0D
   delete from devices that don't support snapshot, instead of=0D
   silently succeeding with no erro.=0D
=0D
Changed in v2:=0D
=0D
 - Use new command names "snapshot-{load,save,delete}" to make it=0D
   clear that these are different from the "savevm|loadvm|delvm"=0D
   as they use the Job framework=0D
=0D
 - Use an include list for block devs, not an exclude list=0D
=0D
