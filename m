Thanks, articles for the QEMU blog are always welcome! Some comments below...

I'd maybe add the links to the virtio-fs and OSv homepage in this paragraph
already, since they are mentioned here for the first time.
For links that you want to use multiple times, you can also declare them at
the end of the file, so that you only have to provide the URL one time. See
e.g. this article as an example:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu-web/-/blob/master/_posts/2017-11-22-haxm-usage-windows.md#L101

Sorry for asking ignorant questions: Does that mean that OSv has a dynamic

maybe rather "based on the FreeBSD sources" or something similar?

I'm not a native speaker, but I'd maybe rather say something like:

After reading the initial paragraphs of this mail, I was somehow expecting
to see at least a short example / description of how to use virtio-fs with
OSv ... do you maybe at least want to provide a pointer to further
documentation here so that people know where to look next if they want to
try out virtio-fs with OSv?
