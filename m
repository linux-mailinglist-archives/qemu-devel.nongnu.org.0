There's really no such thing as "QEMU syntax" for docs comments right
now AFAICT. We have used at least 4 different syntaxes across the various
parts of the codebase and none seems a clear winner in terms of usage. So
I assume that whatever tool we pick, the majority of work will be updatin=
g
existing docs comments to follow whatever syntax is picked.
