This patch series changes the way virtual machines for test builds are
managed.  They are created locally on the developer machine now.  The
installer is booted on the serial console and the scripts walks through
the dialogs to install and configure the guest.

That takes the download.patchew.org server out of the loop and makes it
alot easier to tweak the guest images (adding build dependencies for
example).

The install scripts take care to apply host proxy settings (from *_proxy
environment variables) to the guest, so any package downloads will be
routed through the proxy and can be cached that way.  This also makes
them work behind strict firewalls.

There are also a bunch of smaller tweaks for tests/vm to fix issues I
was struggling with.  See commit messages of individual patches for
details.

Gerd Hoffmann (13):
  scripts: use git archive in archive-source
  tests/vm: send proxy environment variables over ssh
  tests/vm: use ssh with pty unconditionally
  tests/vm: run test builds on snapshot
  tests/vm: proper guest shutdown
  tests/vm: add vm-boot-{ssh,serial}-<guest> targets
  tests/vm: add DEBUG=1 to help text
  tests/vm: serial console support helpers
  tests/vm: openbsd autoinstall, using serial console
  tests/vm: freebsd autoinstall, using serial console
  tests/vm: netbsd autoinstall, using serial console
  tests/vm: fedora autoinstall, using serial console
  tests/vm: ubuntu.i386: apt proxy setup
