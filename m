Well, the tls handshake seems to be blocking I/O.

Yes, i agree.
Since we do multifd tls handshake in main thread through multifd_save_setup(), maybe
we need to make socket_send_channel_create() to be a background thread other
than qio_channel_socket_connect_async()?

Besides，the hang problem itself still need to be figured out and solved...
