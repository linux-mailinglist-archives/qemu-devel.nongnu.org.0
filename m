I did this in v2 this instead of creating sysemu/vmstate-notify.h.

Reminder:

* PATCH 27 "sysemu: Move the VMChangeStateEntry typedef to
  qemu/typedefs.h" makes the subsequent patches more effective: it saves
  ~800 dependencies on whatever header defines the typedef.

* PATCH 28 "Include sysemu/sysemu.h a lot less" succeeds almost entirely
  due to not including it from hw/qdev-core.h.  Damage done by recent
  commit e965ffa70a "qdev: add qdev_add_vm_change_state_handler()".

  The stupidest way to undo that damage would be moving
  qdev_add_vm_change_state_handler() to sysemu/sysemu.h.

  I chose to move it to new sysemu/vmstate-notify.h along with its
  buddies from sysemu/sysemu.h.  The dependency improvement is
  negligible, just because it makes sysemu/sysemu.h less of a dumping
  ground.

For v2, I flipped PATCH 28 to the stupidest way, and put it *before*
PATCH 27.  I split off sysemu/runstate.h only in PATCH 29.  I hope that
way the benefit of each change is more obvious.
