Intel Core i5-2500S CPU @ 2.70GHz.

I've tested with G4 both FPU only and FPU+VMX code on Linux host with =
i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz as was noted in the original cover letter but may =
be I'va also forgotten some details so I list it here again.

Ok, I did test on the G4, here are my results:

Git commit: c1e667d2598b9b3ce62b8e89ed22dd38dfe9f57f
Mac OS 10.4.3 VM
-cpu G4
-USB audio device

Hardfloat=3Dfalse
Audio sounds bad when playing midi file.
Extraction rate: 1.5x
Converting rate: 0.7x
Total time: 7:24

Hardfloat=3Dtrue
Midi audio sounded perfect for about 30 seconds, then it went silent!
Extraction rate: 1.4x (slower with hard float)
Converting rate: 0.7x (same as without hardfloat)
Total time: 7:16 (faster time with hardfloat)

related to FPU, maybe there's a problem with USB/OHCI emulation as well =
because problems with that were reported but it's interesting why you =
get different results changing FPU related stuff. I think OSX uses float =
samples so probably does use FPU for processing sound and may rely on =
some pecularity of the hardware as it was probably optimised for Apple =
hardware. It would be interesting to find out how FPU stuff is related =
to this but since it's broken anyway probably not a show stopper at the =
moment.

When I played sound this second time I hard the same broken audio I =
usually hear with the USB audio device with hardfloat set to false. When =
playing the same midi file with hardfloat set to true, the audio played =
perfectly! It only played for 30 seconds before it went silent.

might be slight timing difference that could cause different audio =

The md5 number for each file does match. Note this time I converted a =

I can give you the full testing suite if you like. I run it on Mac OS =
10.4 but it should compile with gcc on Linux. I will send it to you in a =
separate email because it is big.

Also don't know if it's a fact that these are not used but maybe if we =
test with more guest codes we can find out. That's why I'd like to at =
least have an option to test with hardfloat. Unfortunately enabling =
hardfloat without also making it default would make it slower so if we =
go this way we should make sure we can also enable hardfloat as default.

all these calls are needed then there's not much to simplify (but maybe =
there could be some optimisations possible). This would need someone to =
understand the current code in full first that probably we don't =
currently (ar least I don't for sure so can't really make changes =
either). Another more viable approach is to pick a small part and follow =
through with that and try to clean up and optimise that small part only. =
The exception and fpscr handling is one such part, another could be =
round_canonical() that seems to be high on profiles I've taken. Maybe =
this could be done by reading and understading docs only on the small =
part picked that may be easier than getting everything first. I wonder =
if such smaller tasks could be defined and given out as GSoC or other =
volunteer projects?

I have another idea on how to improve QEMU's performance. What if you =
enabled more CPUs for the PowerPC target? Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Linux =
support multiple CPUs. It might actually be easier to do this than to =
improve the FPU. I imagine the performance increase with multiple =
emulated CPUs would be much more noticeable.=20
