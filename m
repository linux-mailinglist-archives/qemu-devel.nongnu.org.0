I agree.  IMNSHO the reduced attack surface from removing PCI is
(mostly) security theater, however the boot time numbers that Sergio
showed for microvm are quite extreme and I don't think there is any hope
of getting even close with a PCI-based virtual machine.

So I'd even go a step further: if using virtio-mmio for a new machine
type is not acceptable, we should admit that boot time optimization in
QEMU is basically as good as it can get---low-hanging fruit has been
picked with PVH and mmap is the logical next step, but all that's left
is optimizing the guest or something else.

I must say that -M microvm took a while to grow on me, but I think it's
a great example of how the infrastructure provided by QEMU provides
useful features for free, even for the simplest emulated hardware.  For
example, in v3 microvm could only boot from PVH kernels, but the next
firmware-enabled version reuses more of the PC code and thus supports
all of vmlinuz, multiboot and PVH.

Again: Sergio has been very receptive to feedback and has provided
numbers to back the design choices, and we should reciprocate or at
least be very clear on the constraints.
