Options for systems where don't know how to compute a system-wide thread
ID:

0. Return a bogus value: the PID.  This is the status quo.

1. Return a more obviously bogus value: -1.  Semantic compatibility
   break.  Should be harmless, because a QMP client relying on the
   thread-id being the PID would be insane.

2. Make thread-id optional, present iff we can compute a value.

   This is what we should have done, but we didn't, and now it's a
   syntactic compatibility break.  Matters only if it actually breaks
   QMP clients.  We believe the one we know shouldn't break.

Preferences?
