It is time, agreed.

Let's explore multiple alternatives, analyze pros and cons, and not rush
into conclusions. There are several important factors to take into account:
presence of kernel and QEMU support for involved devices, target users,
other virtual machines in QEMU, relation to the general QEMU architecture,
available time resources, etc.

They are terribly outdated, true.

Absolutely! You would be welcomed.
