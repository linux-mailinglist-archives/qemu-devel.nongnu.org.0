Ah, I see!

So just that I get it right; currently the 9pfs test suite writes to a 
ringbuffer with every request (decreasing the free space in the ringbuffer), 
but it never frees up that space in the ringbuffer?

Well, if that's what happens with the ringbuffer, it would need to be 
addressed somehow anyway, otherwise it would be impossible to add more 9pfs 
tests, since they would hit the ringbuffer limit as well at a certain point, 
no matter how simple the requests are.

Wouldn't it make sense to reset the ringbuffer after every succesful, 
individual 9pfs test?

Well, this test is dependent on what's provided exactly by the synth driver 
anyway. So I don't see the value 128 as a problem here. The readdir/split test 
could even determine the max. length of a file provided by synth driver if you 
are concerned about that, because the file name template macro 
QTEST_V9FS_SYNTH_READDIR_FILE used by synth driver is public.

And BTW it is not really this specific 'count' value (128) that triggers this 
issue, if you just run the readdir/split test with i.e.:

	const uint32_t vcount[] = { 128 };

then you won't trigger this test environment issue.
