Peter, I missed to read your reply in time and apologies for late response.

Yes, there is no concept of "NMI" in the GIC from hardware perspective.
However, NMI has been supported from the software by kernel commit
bc3c03ccb4641 ("arm64: Enable the support of pseudo-NMIs"). The NMIs
have higher priority than normal ones. NMIs are deliverable after
local_irq_disable() because the SYS_ICC_PMR_EL1 is tweaked so that
normal interrupts are masked only.

It's unclear about the purpose of "nmi" QMP/HMP command. It's why I
put a RFC tag. The command has been supported by multiple architects
including x86/ppc. However, they are having different behaviors. The
system will be restarted on ppc with this command, but a NMI is injected
through LAPIC on x86. So I'm not sure what architect (system reset on
ppc or injecting NMI on x86) aarch64 should follow.

Thanks,
Gavin
