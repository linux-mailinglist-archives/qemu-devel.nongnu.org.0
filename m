I think most of the CI services have caching proxies to the outside world
to reduce their internetwork load. Would we be able to check with the
webmasters to see what sort of effect we are having on their load?

The problem of using the normal CDN is if we don't keep on top of
updating URLs as the upstream moves the artefacts to archives our CI
keeps breaking. Perhaps we should be hosting these ourselves? But that
involves infrastructure and also ensuring we meet GPL requirements
whereas at the moment we basically offload that work onto the distros.
