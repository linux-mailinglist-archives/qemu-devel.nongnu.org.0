Well, the symlinks didn't resolve the issue. I just tried them to see if
this will solve the issue.

And I installed a lot of packages, blindly trying to solve this issue.
Using full Raspbian instead of Raspbian Lite was also an attempt to do
so. I'm just an advanced Linux user, not a developer! I will cut the
list down to the necessary ones when I get it to compile!

pmaydell: Thank you a lot, it compiles successfully with --disable-tools
in configure. I have one question... does it affect how QEMU static
binary works in any way? I'm just curious.

Title:
  Can't build static on ARM (Raspbian)

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  I am trying to build static QEMU on Raspbian, chrooted into using systemd=
-nspawn with QEMU 4.0.0.
  This is how my compiling looks:
  https://pastebin.com/PYZYeRCN
  Just the problematic part:
  https://pastebin.com/7LxWPMxA
  How I do the compiling:
  https://pastebin.com/pYM17A6R (I plan to share this tutorial when it will=
 work)
  It is a coincidence, or the build fails because it cannot find lp11-kit. =
I did some symlinks:
  ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so.0 /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so=
.0
  ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so
  (should I also symlink libp11.so and libp11.so.2? I think I have installe=
d all required p11 packages!
