We can only build IOMMU page tables lazily if we get faults, which we
generally don't.  We also cannot atomically update IOMMU page tables
relative to a device, so "housekeeping" updates of mappings to (I
assume) consolidate KVM memory slots doesn't work so well when the
device is still running.  Stopping the device via something like the
bus-master enable bit also sounds like a whole set of problems itself.
I assume these simplified mappings also reduce our resolution for later
unmaps, which isn't necessarily a win for an assigned device either if
it exposes the race again each boot.

Maybe the question is why we don't see these errors more regularly, is
there something unique about the memory layout of this platform versus
others that causes larger memory regions to be coalesced together only
to be later unmapped and provide more exposure to this issue?  Thanks,

Alex
