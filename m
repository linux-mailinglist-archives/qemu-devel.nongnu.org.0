Taking a step back here and looking at the bigger picture of
migration protocol configuration....

Almost every time we add a new feature to migration, we end up
having to define at least one new migration parameter, then wire
it up in libvirt, and then the mgmt app too, often needing to
ensure it is turn on for both client and server at the same time.


For some features, requiring an explicit opt-in could make sense,
because we don't know for sure that the feature is always a benefit.
These are things that can be thought of as workload sensitive
tunables.


For other features though, it feels like we would be better off if
we could turn it on by default with no config. These are things
that can be thought of as migration infrastructre / transport
architectural designs.


eg it would be nice to be able to use multifd by default for
migration. We would still want a tunable to control the number
of channels, but we ought to be able to just start with a default
number of channels automatically, so the tunable is only needed
for special cases.

This post-copy is another case.  We should start off knowing
we can switch to post-copy at any time. We should further be
able to add pre-emption if we find it available. IOW, we should
not have required anything more than 'switch to post-copy' to
be exposed to mgmtm apps.

Or enabling zero copy on either send or receive side.

Or enabling kernel-TLS offload

Or ..insert other interesting protocol feature...



All this stems from our current migration protocol that started
as a single unidirectional channel, which goes straight into
the migration data stream, with no protocol handshake  and
thus no feature negotiation either.

We've offloaded feature negotiation to libvirt and in turn to
the mgmt app and this is awful, for thue layers above, but
also awful for QEMU. Because multifd requires mgmt app opt-in,
we can wait 10 years and there will still be countless apps
using single-fd mode because they've not been updated to
opt-in.  If we negotiated features at QEMU level we could
have everything using multifd in a few years, and have dropped
single-fd mode a few years later.


So rather than following our historical practice, anjd adding
yet another migration parameter for a specific feature, I'd
really encourage us to put a stop to it and future proof
ourselves.


Introduce one *final-no-more-never-again-after-this* migration
capability called "protocol-negotiation".


When that capability is set, first declare that henceforth the
migration transport is REQUIRED to support **multiple**,
**bi-directional** channels. We might only use 1 TCP channel
in some cases, but it declares our intent that we expect to be
able to use as many channels as we see fit henceforth.

Now define a protocol handshake. A 5 minute thought experiment
starts off with something simple:

   dst -> src:  Greeting Message:
                  Magic: "QEMU-MIGRATE"  12 bytes
                  Num Versions: 1 byte
                  Version list: 1 byte * num versions
                  Num features: 4 bytes
                  Feature list: string * num features

   src -> dst:  Greeting Reply:
                  Magic: "QEMU-MIGRATE" 12 bytes
                  Select version: 1 byte
                  Num select features: 4 bytes
                  Selected features: string * num features   

   .... possibly more src <-> dst messages depending on
        features negotiated....

   src -> dst:  start migration
 
    ...traditional migration stream runs now for the remainder
       of this connection ...



I suggest "dst" starts first, so that connecting to a dst lets you
easily debug whether QEMU is speaking v2 or just waiting for the
client to send something as traditionally the case.

This shouldn't need very much code, and it gives us flexibility
to do all sorts of interesting things going forward with less
overhead for everyone involved.

We can layer in a real authentication system like SASL after
the greeting without any libvirt / mgmt app support

We can enable zero-copy at will. We can enable kernel-TLS at
will. We can add new TCP connections for clever feature XYZ.

We get a back channel every time, so dst can pass info back
to the src to optimize behaviour.

We can experiment with features and throw them away again
later without involving the mgmt app, since we negotiate
their use.


With regards,
Daniel
