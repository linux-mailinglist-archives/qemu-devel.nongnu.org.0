issue with that is that to put device into "peripheral" container,
'the user' must provide 'id'. (currently QEMU isn't able to do it on its own [1])

But it doesn't mean that cold-plugged CPUs can't be unpluged.
What current users could do is start QEMU like this (simplified version):

 $QEMU -smp 1,maxcpus=N -device foo-cpu-type,id=CPU00 -device foo-cpu-type,id=CPU01 ...

i.e. 1st CPU is not manageable due to lack if 'id' and is created by board code,
the rest have 'id' and could be managed.


Question is:
  why you are looking into 'what container' is used for CPUs?


1) here is what I could find on IDs topic

it won't, see call chain:

  qmp_device_add()
      -> qdev_device_add()
          -> qdev_set_id()

ex:
one could use -device/device_add without any ids if such devices aren't planned
to be unplugged during runtime or for unpluggable devices
