I'd suggest to insert this before the pull-request entry, in case anybody 
reads the manual sequentially, it might be better to learn about the patch 
submission process first before reading about pull requests.
(I can fix this up when picking up the patch, no need to resend)

That hyperlink showed up in the rendered output. I'll fix it up by removing 
the "``" quotes.

That ".". looks a little bit weird in the output ... maybe we should replace

That --- gets translated into a â€” character ... I'll replace the "---" with 
``---`` to fix it.
