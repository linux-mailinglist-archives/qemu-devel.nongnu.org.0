Thanks for writing up this summary!  The requirements and possible
solutions are now clear.

We need someone willing to set up and maintain the CI.

One-off tasks:

1. Create CI runners that offer similar cross-architecture coverage to
   Peter's current setup.  qemu.org has some x86, ppc, and s390 server
   resources available.  I'm not sure about ARM and other architectures.

2. Write CI configuration to run Peter's "make && make check && make
   check-tcg && linux-user-test".

3. Document the CI on wiki.qemu.org.

Ongoing responsibilities:

1. Triage failures that the qemu.git maintainer thinks are related to CI
   runners.

2. Keep the CI up-to-date and runners online.

Any volunteers?

Stefan
