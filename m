Public bug reported:

AMD CPUs have L3 cache per 2, 3 or 4 cores. Currently, TOPOEXT seems to
always map Cache ass if it was an 4-Core per CCX CPU, which is
incorrect, and costs upwards 30% performance (more realistically 10%) in
L3 Cache Layout aware applications.

Example on a 4-CCX CPU (1950X /w 8 Cores and no SMT):

  <cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
    <model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
    <vendor>AMD</vendor>
    <topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'8' threads=3D'1'/>

In windows, coreinfo reports correctly:

****----  Unified Cache 1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
----****  Unified Cache 6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

On a 3-CCX CPU (3960X /w 6 cores and no SMT):

 <cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
    <model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
    <vendor>AMD</vendor>
    <topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'6' threads=3D'1'/>

in windows, coreinfo reports incorrectly:

****--  Unified Cache  1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
----**  Unified Cache  6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64


Validated against 3.0, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 versions of qemu-kvm. =


With newer Qemu there is a fix (that does behave correctly) in using the di=
es parameter: =

 <qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D3,threads=3D1,dies=3D2,sockets=3D1'/>

The problem is that the dies are exposed differently than how AMD does
it natively, they are exposed to Windows as sockets, which means, you
can't ever have a machine with more than two CCX (6 cores) as Windows
only supports two sockets. (Should this be reported as a separate bug?)
