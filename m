My CI job for ArmVirtQemu/EDK2 build tested GCC48 and GCC49 until very
recently, and I never experienced any issues when running those
images, although it's been much longer that I actually tried that. So
I wouldn't recommend against it, and if we do identify any issues, we
should either deprecate GCC48 (for ArmVirtQemu or for AArch64
altogether) or fix them.
