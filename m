The cache was needed when replay does not follow the record behavior.
E.g., included additional deadline calculations or timer checks.
I'm not sure, that it is still needed, and I'll check it during future
refactoring session.

This is a bug, when the host clock is replayed incorrectly.

Only if you want to replay just the clock.
But replaying whole execution includes instruction counting and thread 
synchronization.

This clock is used for icount-related timers. For now icount is required
for record replay. If you want to replay only host clock, you don't need 
this one.
