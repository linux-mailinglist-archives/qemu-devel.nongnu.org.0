Yeah, this feels like we're just venturing into a bad part of town.
Simplest is probably to just document that applications should never
expect more than 64kb of total SMBIOS data to be viable regardless
of the SMBIOS entry point.

Given this, I'm thinking it might be overkill to even both with
supporting SMBIOS 3.0 for x86, unless it offers some other compelling
benefit over SMBIOS 2.1 that you know of ?

Daniel
