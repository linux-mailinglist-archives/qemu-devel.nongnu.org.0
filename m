The approach I took in this patch series is to launch a session bus just
for this virtiofsd.  The abstract socket unix(7) namespace used by GDBus
by default does not offer any security.  I think any process on the host
can connect to it, regardless of uid/gid.

A path like unix:path=3D/tmp/foo would allow us to use UNIX Domain Socket
permissions as the main security mechanism.  I'm not enthusiastic about
using SELinux or some kind of DBus-specific policy language if we can
avoid it because it's complex and obscure.
