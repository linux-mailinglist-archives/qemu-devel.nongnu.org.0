I think the above provides this.  For Kirti's example above of
transitioning from pre-copy to stop-and-copy, the device could refuse
to transition to stop-and-copy, generating an error on the write() of
device_state.  The user re-reading device_state would allow them to
determine the current device state, still in pre-copy or failed.  Only
the latter would require a device reset.

Right, unless I'm missing one, it seems invalid->running is the only
self transition the device should make, though still by way of user
interaction via the reset ioctl.  Thanks,
