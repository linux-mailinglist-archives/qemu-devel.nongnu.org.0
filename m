Yes. More easily triggered now with oob. We ran into this a longer time
ago, but our only reliable trigger was a customized version of
-loadstate which loads the state from a separate file instead of the
vmstate region of a qcow2. Turns out that doing this on a slow storage
(~12s to load the data) caused our status daemon to try to poll the qmp
socket during the load-state and give up after a 3s timeout. And since
the BH runs in the main loop which is not even entered until after the
loadstate has finished, but iothread handling the qmp socket does fill &
clear the queue, the qmp socket always ended up unusable afterwards.

Aside from that we have users reporting the same symptom (hanging qmp)
appearing randomly on busy systems.

Sorry, I meant to add a comment pointing to monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher(),
which does the following *after* popping 1 element off the queue:

    need_resume =3D !qmp_oob_enabled(mon) ||
        mon->qmp_requests->length =3D=3D QMP_REQ_QUEUE_LEN_MAX - 1;
    qemu_mutex_unlock(&mon->qmp_queue_lock);

It's supposed to be the same condition, but _before_ popping off an
element (hence no `- 1`), but the queue shouldn't be empty as well
otherwise the `monitor_suspend()` in `handle_qmp_command()` hasn't
happened, though on second though we could probably just return early in
that case.).

I thought so when first reading through it, but on second though, we
should probably avoid this for sanity's sake.
Maybe with a flag, or an extra parameter.
Or we could introduce a "bool queue_filled" we set in handle_qmp_command(=
)
instead of "calculating" `need_resume` in 2 places and unset it in
`monitor_data_destroy()` before clearing the queue?
