This should live in the not-yet-created docs/system (the "system emulation
user's guide"), along with much of the content currently still in
the texinfo docs. But we don't have that structure yet and won't
until we do the texinfo conversion, so I think for the moment we
have two reasonable choices:
 (1) put it in the texinfo, so it is at least shipped to
     users until we get around to doing our docs conversion
 (2) leave it in docs/microvm.rst for now (we have a bunch
     of other docs in docs/ which are basically there because
     they're also awaiting the texinfo conversion and creation
     of the docs/user and docs/system manuals)

My ideal vision of how to do documentation of individual
machines, incidentally, would be to do it via doc comments
or some other kind of structured markup in the .c files
that define the machine, so that we could automatically
collect up the docs for the machines we're building,
put them in to per-architecture sections of the docs,
have autogenerated stub "this machine exists but isn't
documented yet" entries, etc. But that's not something that
we could easily do today so I don't want to block interim
improvements to our documentation just because I have some
nice theoretical idea for how it ought to work :-)

thanks
