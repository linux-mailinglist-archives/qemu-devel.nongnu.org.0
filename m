Ohh! I see. Yes you are right. "This feature shall only be issued during
initialization prior to creation of any I/O Submission and/or Completion
Queues.".

command again until after a controller reset. Then we also don't need
the counter, but just a flag to indicate if any I/O queue has been
configured.

I've fixed that up.
