+=3D Fuzzing =3D
+
+=3D=3D Introduction =3D=3D
+
+This document describes the fuzzing infrastructure in QEMU and how to use =
it
+to add additional fuzzing targets.
+
+=3D=3D Basics =3D=3D
+
+Fuzzing operates by passing inputs to an entry point/target function. The
+fuzzer tracks the code coverage triggered by the input. Based on these
+findings, the fuzzer mutates the input and repeats the fuzzing.=20
+
+To fuzz QEMU, we rely on libfuzzer. Unlike other fuzzers such as AFL, libf=
uzzer
+is an _in-process_ fuzzer. For the developer, this means that it is their
+responsibility to ensure that state is reset between fuzzing-runs.
+
+libfuzzer provides its own main() and expects the developer to implement t=
he
+entrypoint "LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput".
+
+Currently, Fuzz targets are built out to fuzz virtual-devices from guests.=
 The
+fuzz targets can use qtest and qos functions to pass inputs to virtual dev=
ices.
+
+=3D=3D Main Modifications required for Fuzzing =3D=3D
+
+Fuzzing is enabled with the -enable-fuzzing flag, which adds the needed cf=
lags
+to enable Libfuzzer and AddressSanitizer. In the code, most of the changes=
 to
+existing qemu source are surrounded by #ifdef CONFIG_FUZZ statements. Here=
 are
+the key areas that are changed:
+
+=3D=3D=3D General Changes =3D=3D=3D
+
+vl.c:main renamed to real_main to avoid conflicts when libfuzzer is linked=
 in.
+Also, real_main returns where it would normally call main_loop.=20
+
+The fuzzer adds an accelerator. The accelerator does not do anything, much
+like the qtest accelerator.
+
+=3D=3D=3D Changes to SaveVM =3D=3D=3D
+
+There aren't any particular changes to SaveVM, but the fuzzer adds a type
+of file "ramfile" implemented in test/fuzz/ramfile.c which allocates a buf=
fer
+on the heap to which it saves the vmstate.
+
+=3D=3D=3D Changes to QTest =3D=3D=3D
+
+QEMU-fuzz modifies the qtest server(qtest.c) and qtest client
+(tests/libqtest.c) so that they communicate within the same QEMU process. =
In
+the qtest server, there is a qtest_init_fuzz function to initialize the
+QTestState. Normally, qtest commands are passed to socket_send which
+communicates the command to the server/QEMU process over a socket. The fuz=
zer,
+instead, directly calls the qtest server recieve function with the the com=
mand
+string as an argument. The server usually responds to commands with an "OK=
"
+command. To support this, there is an added qtest_client_recv function in
+libqtest.c, which the server calls directly.
+
+At the moment, qtest's qmp wrapper functions are not supported.
+
+=3D=3D=3D Chages to QOS =3D=3D=3D
+
+QOS tests are usually linked against the compiled tests/qos-test.c. The ma=
in
+function in this file initializes the QOS graph and uses some QMP commands=
 to
+query the qtest server for the available devices. It also registers the te=
sts
+implemented in all of the linked qos test-case files. Then it uses a DFS w=
alker
+to iterate over QOS graph and determine the required QEMU devices/argument=
s and
+device initialization functions to perform each test.
+
+The fuzzer doesn't link against qos-test, but re-uses most of the function=
ality
+in test/fuzz/qos_helpers.c The major changes are that the walker simply sa=
ves
+the last QGraph path for later use in the fuzzer. The
+qos_set_machines_devices_available function is changed to directly used qm=
p_*
+commands. Note that to populate the QGraph, the fuzzer still needs to be l=
inked
+against the devices described in test/libqos/*.o
+
+=3D=3D The Fuzzer's Lifecycle =3D=3D
+
+The fuzzer has two entrypoints that libfuzzer calls.
+
+LLVMFuzzerInitialize: called prior to fuzzing. Used to initialize all of t=
he
+necessary state
+
+LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput: called for each fuzzing run. Processes the input a=
nd
+resets the state at the end of each run.
+
+In more detail:
+
+LLVMFuzzerInitialize parses the arguments to the fuzzer (must start with t=
wo
+dashes, so they are ignored by libfuzzer main()). Currently, the arguments
+select the fuzz target. Then, the qtest client is initialized. If the targ=
et
+requires qos, qgraph is set up and the QOM/LIBQOS modules are initailized.
+Then the QGraph is walked and the QEMU cmd_line is determined and saved.
+
+After this, the vl.c:real_main is called to set up the guest. After this, =
the
+fuzzer saves the initial vm/device state to ram, after which the initiliza=
tion
+is complete.
+
+LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput: Uses qtest/qos functions to act based on the fuzz
+input. It is also responsible for manually calling the main loop/main_loop=
_wait
+to ensure that bottom halves are executed. Finally, it calls reset() which
+restores state from the ramfile and/or resets the guest.
+
+
+Since the same process is reused for many fuzzing runs, QEMU state needs t=
o
+be reset at the end of each run. There are currently three implemented
+options for resetting state:=20
+1. Reboot the guest between runs.
+   Pros: Straightforward and fast for simple fuzz targets.=20
+   Cons: Depending on the device, does not reset all device state. If the
+   device requires some initialization prior to being ready for fuzzing
+   (common for QOS-based targets), this initialization needs to be done af=
ter
+   each reboot.
+   Example target: --virtio-net-ctrl-fuzz
+2. vmsave the state to RAM, once, and restore it after each run.
+   Alternatively only save the device state(savevm.c:qemu_save_device_stat=
e)
+   Pros: Do not need to initialize devices prior to each run.
+   VMStateDescriptions often specify more state the device resetting
+   functions called during reboots.
+   Cons: Restoring state is often slower than rebooting. There is
+   currently no way to save the QOS object state, so the objects usually
+   needs to be re-allocated, defeating the purpose of one-time device
+   initialization.
+   Example target: --qtest-fuzz
+3. Run each test case in a separate forked process and copy the coverage
+   information back to the parent. This is fairly similar to AFL's "deferr=
ed"
+   fork-server mode [3]
+   Pros: Relatively fast. Devices only need to be initialized once. No nee=
d
+   to do slow reboots or vmloads.
+   Cons: Not officially supported by libfuzzer and the implementation is v=
ery
+   flimsy. Does not work well for devices that rely on dedicated threads.
+   Example target: --qtest-fork-fuzz
+
+=3D=3D Adding new Targets =3D=3D
+1. Create a file : tests/fuzz/[file].c
+2. Add target registration function and fuzz_target_init(FUNC) at the bott=
om of
+the file.
+3. In the registration function, register targets using fuzz_add_qos_targe=
t or
+fuzz_add_target. The arguments to thes function specify the resetting meth=
od
+and QOS path.
+4. These functions refererence a fuzz function which should be a:
+static void func(const unsigned char* Data, size_t Size)
+Inside the fuzz function, translate the "Data" into qtest actions.
+5. Add [file].o to target/i386/Makefile.objs
+
+tests/fuzz/qtest_fuzz.c and tests/fuzz/virtio-net-fuzz.c both contain exam=
ples
+of fuzz targets that follow this structure.
