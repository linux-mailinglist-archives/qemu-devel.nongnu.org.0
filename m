QAPIfying -machine, -cpu, and -device would be wonderful.

Yes, we can.  I think it's a good idea.  But:

I'm not sure about the "instead of" part.  I don't want perfect
to be the enemy of done, and I don't want QAPIfication of
-machine to be a requirement to start reporting machine type
deprecation information.

It also includes a machine-friendly suggested alternative (which
I think is even more important that the human-readable message).

We could extend QAPI introspection to return that if necessary,
right?
