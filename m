Fair enough; I'm happy to live with your decision as maintainer's=20
prerogative.

I _do_ hope that the actual implementation series gets merged soon,=20
though, and that as part of that series, you remember to tweak the=20
optional 'Feature Name' extension header to name the new incompatible=20
bit introduced in this patch.  And there's the simultaneous patches from=20
my qcow2 autoclear-all-zeroes bit that touch the same files, so we may=20
have some rebasing fun ahead of us...
