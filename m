Based on the above, let me try & summarize what we need behaviour to be:

  - Integer mode (current default):

       - QEMU & clients MUST format integer fields as numbers
         regardless of size

       - QEMU & clients MUST parse number format for any integer
         fields

  - String mode:

       - QEMU & clients MUST format integer fields as strings
         if their value can not fit in a 32-bit integer.

       - QEMU & clients MAY format integer fields as strings
         even if their value can fit in 32-bit integer

       - QEMU & client MUST parse both string and number format
         for any integer fields.

Unless I'm missing something, this should ensure we don't loose precision,
can always parse large numbers, and can internally change QEMU precision
from int8/16/32 upto full int64 without breaking clients.

Daniel
