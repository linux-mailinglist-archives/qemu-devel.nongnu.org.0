Having a hotplug test case using avocado_qemu would help catch
some bugs, but it's not enough if we want to catch integration
issues between QEMU and libvirt (like this one).

I wouldn't focus just on that particular libvirt test case.
I suggest we run a reasonably large set of libvirt test cases
against QEMU release candidates as soon as they are tagged.
