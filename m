I don't think there is any relevant difference any more since commit
15489c769b9 ('block: auto-generated node-names'). We can only see a
difference if a BDS was created, but never opened. This means either
that we are still in the process of opening an image or that we have a
bug somewhere.

Maybe we should remove graph_bdrv_states and replace all of its uses
with the more obviously correct all_bdrv_states (if we are sure that
all users aren't called between creating and opening a BDS).

I wonder if the iscsi one can't be replaced with bdrv_new_open_driver().
Manually building a half-opened BDS like it does currently looks
suspicious.

I probably just didn't realise that graph_bdrv_states exists and is
effectively the same. I knew that all_bdrv_states contains what I want,
so I just wanted to access that.

But if anonymous BDSes did actually still exist, drain would want to
wait for those as well, so it's the more natural choice anyway.
