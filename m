Hi List,

For my VM setup I tend to use a lot of VM to VM single network links to d=
o routing, switching and bridging in VM's instead of the host.
Also stemming from a silly fetish to sometimes use some OpenBSD VMs as fi=
rewall, but that is besides the point here.
I am using the standard, tested and true method of using a whole bunch=C2=
=A0 of bridges, having 2 vhost taps each.
This works and it's fast, but it is a nightmare to manage with all the in=
terfaces on the host.

So, I looked a bit into how I can improve this, basically coming down to =
"How to connect 2 VM's together in a really fast and easy way".
This however, is not as straightforward as I thought, without going the w=
hole route of OVS/Snabb/any other big feature bloated
software switch.
Cause really, all I want is to connect 2 VM's in a fast and easy way. Sho=
uldn't be that hard right?

Anyways, I end up finding tests/vhost-user-bridge.c, which is very nicely=
 doing half of what I wanted.
After some doubling of the vhosts and eliminating udp, I came up with a V=
host User Cross Cable. (patch in next post).
It just opens 2 vhost sockets instead of 1 and does the forwarding betwee=
n them.
A terrible hack and slash of vhost-user-bridge.c, probably now with bugs =
causing the dead of many puppies and the end of humanity,
but it works!

However... I now am left with some questions, which I hope some of you ca=
n answer.

1.
I looked, googled, read and tried things, but it is likely that I am an c=
omplete and utter moron and my google-fu has just been awful...
Very likely... But is there really no other way then I have found to just=
 link up 2 QEMU's in a fast non-bridge way? (No, not sockets.)
Not that OVS and the likes are not fine software, but do we really need t=
he whole DPDK to do this?

2.
In the unlikely chance that I'm not an idiot, then I guess now we have a =
nice simple cross cable.
However, I am still a complete vhost/virtio idiot who has no clue how it =
works and just randomly brute-forced code into submission.
Maybe not entirely true, but I would still appreciate it very much if som=
eone with more knowledge into vhost to have a quick look at
how things are done in cc.

Specifically this monstrosity in TX (speed_killer is a 1MB buffer and kil=
ls any speed):
=C2=A0 ret =3D iov_from_buf(sg, num, 0, speed_killer,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 iov_to_buf(out_sg, out_num,=
 0, speed_killer,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 MIN(iov_size(out_sg, out_num), sizeo=
f speed_killer)
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 )
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=
=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 );

=C2=A0 vs. the commented:
=C2=A0 //ret =3D iov_copy(sg, num, out_sg, out_num, 0,
=C2=A0 //=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 MIN(iov_size(sg, num), iov_size(out_sg, out_num)));

The first is obviously a quick fix to get things working, however, in my =
meager understanding, should the 2nd one not work?
Maybe I'm messing up my vectors here, or I am messing up my understanding=
 of iov_copy, but shouldn't the 2nd form be the way to zero
copy?

3.
Now if Cross Cable is actually a new and (after a code-rewrite of 10) a v=
iable way to connect 2 QEMU's together, could I actually
suggest a better way?
I am thinking of a '-netdev vhost-user-slave' option to connect (as clien=
t or server) to a master QEMU running '-netdev vhost-user'.
This way there is no need for any external program at all, the master can=
 have it's memory unshared and everything would just work
and be fast.
Also the whole thing can fall back to normal virtio if memory is not shar=
ed and it would even work in pure usermode without any
context switch.

Building a patch for this idea I could maybe get around to, don't clearly=
 have an idea how much work this would be but I've done
crazier things.
But is this is something that someone might be able to whip up in an hour=
 or two? Someone who actually does have a clue about vhost
and virtio maybe? ;-)

4.
Hacking together cc from bridge I noticed the use of container_of() to ge=
t from vudev to state in the vu callbacks.
Would it be an idea to add a context pointer to the callbacks (possibly g=
otten from VuDevIface)?
And I know. First post and I have the forwardness to even suggest an API =
change! I know!
But it makes things a bit simpler to avoid globals and it makes sense to =
have some context in a callback to know what's going on,
right? ;-)

5.
Last one, promise.
I'm very much in the church of "less software =3D=3D less bugs =3D=3D les=
s security problems".
Running cc or a vhost-user-slave means QEMU has fast networking in usermo=
de without the need for anything else then AF_UNIX + shared
mem.
So might it be possible to weed out any modern fancy stuff like the Inter=
net Protocol, TCP, taps, bridges, ethernet and tokenring
from a kernel and run QEMU on that?
The idea here is a kernel with storage, a serial console, AF_UNIX and vfi=
o-pci, only running QEMU.
Would this be feasible? Or does QEMU need a kernel which at least has a g=
rasp of understanding of what AF_INET and ethernet is?
(Does a modern kernel even still support tokenring? No idea, Probably doe=
s.)


Finally, an example and some numbers.

Compiling and starting the cross cable:
./configure
make tests/vhost-user-cc
tests/vhost-user-cc -l /tmp/left.sock -r /tmp/right.sock

(Note, the cross cable will quit if one of the vm's quits, but the VM's w=
ill reconnect when cc starts again.)

2 VM's, host1 and host2, Linux guests, run like this:

host1:

First, speed via eth0 (bridged tap with vhost, host2 runs './iperf3 -s'):
=C2=A0 root@host1:~/iperf-3.1.3/src# ./iperf3 -c 192.168.0.2 -i 1 -t 10
=C2=A0 ...
=C2=A0 [=C2=A0 4]=C2=A0=C2=A0 0.00-10.00=C2=A0 sec=C2=A0 10.7 GBytes=C2=A0=
 9.22 Gbits/sec=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 receiver

Second, speed via eth1 (Vhost Cross Cable):
=C2=A0 root@host1:~/iperf-3.1.3/src# ./iperf3 -c 192.168.1.2 -i 1 -t 10
=C2=A0 ...
=C2=A0 [=C2=A0 4]=C2=A0=C2=A0 0.00-10.00=C2=A0 sec=C2=A0 2.05 GBytes=C2=A0=
 1.76 Gbits/sec=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 receiver

So, a factor of 6 slowdown against bridge. Not too bad, considering the b=
ad iovec mem-copying I do.
Lots of room for improvement though, but at least for me it's also 5 time=
s faster as socket.
