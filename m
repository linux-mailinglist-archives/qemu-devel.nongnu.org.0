I know that's not quite the answer to your question, but if you look
for example at

  https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit

you'll see that the same URL can be used both for viewing with a
browser *and* cloning.

Basically with cgit all requests go through the CGI script, and an
advantage of that is that you don't even need to call

  git update-server-info

to make the repository accessible via HTTPs. It's also pretty fast
and extremely easy to setup. Maybe consider switching from gitweb
to it?
