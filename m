I'm not sure whether this is appropriate here, though it depends on
what QEMU does with the data.

Something non-obvious to be aware of:

As exposed through the signal frame and the KVM ABI, the memory
representation of an SVE reg is invariant with respect to the
endianness.

IIUC, the byte order seen for a V-reg in KVM_REG_ARM_CORE and for
the equivalent Z-reg in KVM_REG_ARM64_SVE would be the opposite of each
other on BE, but the same on LE.

This is a feature of the archtiecture: a V-reg can be stored as a single
value, but Z-regs are in general too big to be treated as a single
value: they are always treated as a sequence of elements, and the
largest element size supported is 64 bits, not 128.  IIUC, there is no
direct native way to store with 128-bit swabbing: some explicit data
processing operation would also be needed to swap adjacent 64-bit
elements in the vector around the store/load.

This is not specified in the ABI documentation -- I should address that.

If this is infeasible for KVM to work with, we could perhaps change it,
but I'm not too keen on that at this stage.  KVM_REG_ARM64_SVE_VLS
has a similar behaviour: it's a vector of 64-bit possibly-swabbed words,
not a single possibly-swabbed 512-bit word.


Looking at the kernel, I may have screwed up in places where the
two representations interact, like fpsimd_to_sve().  I should take a
look at that...  This doesn't affect the KVM ABI though.

Cheers
---Dave
