Interesting.

Absolutely.

Right.  Still, there's a lot that can be done until we eventually
exaust all possibilities and look into sending bad messages.

I personally need to get acquainted with the currently available APIs
first, but it looks like you alread have ideas for extensions that
would come in handy.

Also, the one concern I have is how to deploy the library and Python
bindings so that we can host those more advanced tests and still allow
for a "make check-acceptance"-like experience.  What I mean is, I
expect the Python bindings to be easily installed by pip, by I'd be
(positively) surprised if the libgvnc would also have such an easy
bootstrap.

Any ideas on this?

Thanks!
