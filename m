less is more, enforce people to add such stull to capstone is a good idea,
unless there is a

&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#39;ve spent a couple of days poking at the llvm disassembler.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; As a general-purpose disassembler, it&#39;s less than ideal.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (1) The disassembler is not &quot;inclusive&quot;.=C2=A0 You present i=
t with<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0a specific cpu configuration, and anything that cpu=

o &quot;maximum&quot;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0configuration that attempts to decode any insn in t=
he ISA.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (2) All configuration is done via strings, so you can&#39;t<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0programatically tell what&#39;s supported.=C2=A0 I =
think they&#39;re<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0expecting all of these strings to come from the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0command line.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (3) If you include a unrecognized cpu feature, an error is<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0printed to stderr.=C2=A0 Which suggests that we wou=
ld easily<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0wind up with problems between llvm versions.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; (4) &quot;Probing&quot; what is supported with a particular version is=
<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0done via &quot;+help&quot;, which prints what is su=

<br>
Ouch, that sounds ugly, indeed.<br>
<br>
&gt; In the short-term, I guess I&#39;ll look into updating our capstone br=

&gt; possibly reject using the system version -- either use the git submodu=
le or<br>
&gt; nothing.<br>
<br>
Sounds like the best option right now.<br>
<br>
Is capstone good enough already to replace libvixl?<br>
<br>
And what about the other old disassemblers that we have in disasm/ ?<br>
