Mmm. More specifically, indentation was previously unimportant
within a multiline block of text, and is now important there.

I guess so. We still want some test coverage of the stuff the
doc-comment parser is doing that's actually looking for
arguments and so on; we don't really need to check that
rst is rst.

It's been a while since I wrote this patch, but basically IIRC
it's "make the minimal changes necessary so that the test does
not start failing for the parser changes that will follow".

Because in the tightened syntax, you can either have:

@foo: line 1
      line 2

(the definition part of the argument is multiple lines of
rST, which all must be lined up to start at the same column)

or

@foo:
line1
line2

(the definition is multiple lines of rST, which all start
in column 1)

But
@foo:
   line1

is neither of the above, and will be invalid.

The old parser simply stripped all the leading whitespace
from this kind of multiline lump-of-doc-text. That doesn't
work for rST because we want to be able to have doc-text
where leading whitespace matters. So we need to know how
many characters of whitespace to delete from each line. The
two options above basically correspond to the two major
pre-existing kinds of doc-comment.

Compare commit 26ec4e53f2bf0a381, which fixed up the
doc comments in qapi/ proper to follow this "one of
these two indent models, but not anything else" pattern.

Again, because it needs to follow one of the two
indent patterns described above. Either no text
following the "@i:" and all lines start in column 1,
or all lines have to start in the same column as
the text following the "@i:". In this case I went for
option 2.

The test input is a bit odd because it's talking
about @b in the description-text for @i, but there
you go. You could alternatively add a newline
after the @i: line to put the text "@b is undocumented"
into the doc-text for the whole @Alternate struct
rather than into the doc-text for the @i member.

As above, beacuse it's not in either of the
two standard "this is what indent for a multi-line
bit of doc text for an argument can be" patterns.
