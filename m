Title:
  HTIF symbols no longer recognized by RISC-V spike board

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Tested commit: f34edbc760b0f689deddd175fc08732ecb46665f

  I belive this was introduced in
  0ac24d56c5e7d32423ea78ac58a06b444d1df04d when the spike's
  load_kernel() was moved to riscv_load_kernel() which no longer
  included htif_symbol_callback().
