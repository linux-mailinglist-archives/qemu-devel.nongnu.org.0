Yes, I assumed 64k clusters.

The other somewhat popular cluster size is probably 2 MB, where I think
images sizes that are not a multiple of 512 GB are rather likely...

Right. I already corrected my statement to include > 1024 MB in the Red
Hat Bugzilla (but still didn't consider other cluster sizes).

Hm... And suddently it makes sense. :-)

So I assume all of 512k/1024k/2048k actually perform better? Or is the
effect neglegible for 1024k/2048k?
