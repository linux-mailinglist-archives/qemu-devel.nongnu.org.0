Public bug reported:

So I have installed FreeDOS on my USB thumbdrive, by using Rufus.
Everything goes as expected so far. That's good.

When I run QEMU with this command line:
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -drive file=3D\\.\PhysicalDrive1

it of course is read-only, just like the resulting console message says:
WARNING: Image format was not specified for '\\.\PhysicalDrive1' and probin=
g guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, wr=
ite operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.


So what I then did, was I ran QEMU with this command line:
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -drive file=3D\\.\PhysicalDrive1,format=3Draw

As expected, the above mentioned console message no longer appears.
However, beyond that, QEMU doesn't behave as it should regarding read-only =
status. When I try any operation that involves writing to the drive, it bec=
omes quite clear that the drive is still read-only. Any writing operations =
to the drive result in FreeDOS giving me the error message:
Error writing to drive C: DOS area: sector not found.

The above situation is clearly a bug. QEMU should not be treating it as
read-only once I specify format=3Draw.

Note that drive C is how the guest OS refers to the USB thumbdrive (it's
drive E in my host OS, and drive C in my host OS is the actual system
drive).

And yes, it is a QEMU bug. It's not a FreeDOS bug I tested it with this com=
mand line, so that all changes would be written to a temporary snapshot fil=
e:
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -drive file=3D\\.\PhysicalDrive1,format=3Draw,snapsh=
ot
That last drive option "snapshot" tells QEMU to create a temporary snapshot=
 file, and to write all changes to that. When I do that, all write operatio=
ns are successful. So it seems that there is a bug in QEMU where it keeps r=
ead-only mode in place for a physical drive, even when format=3Draw is spec=
ified. Please fix this bug. Thanks in advance.

Here's my current setup.
Host OS: Windows 10 (64bit)
Guest OS: FreeDOS
QEMU version: 4.1.0
