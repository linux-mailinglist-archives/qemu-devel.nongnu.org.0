When I first encountered the problem, it wasn't actually related to
64-bit PCI MMIO -- it was much earlier, namely when I worked on enabling
64GiB+ *RAM size* in OVMF. Things fell apart just from the guest memory
side of things. The 64-bit PCI MMIO concern is an extrapolation from
that, not a symptom encountered in practice.

Let me find my original message about the RAM symptom...

... Meh, I can find two discussions related to this, in my personal
archives. One is on one of our internal RH mailing lists, so I'm not
going to quote that here. The other is on the public edk2-devel mailing
list -- but from June 2015, when edk2-devel was still hosted on
sourceforge.net. The sourceforge.net archives are no longer accessible,
and GMANE (the secondary archive) is dead too.

So I'm going to have to attach the one message from the thread that I
feel contains the most information. Start reading at the string "BUG:".

Thanks,
Laszlo

We have a root cause, it seems. The issue is that the processor in my
laptop, on which I tested, has only 36 bits for physical addresses:

  $ grep 'address sizes' /proc/cpuinfo
  address sizes   : 36 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
  ...

Which matches where the problem surfaces (64 GB guest-phys address
space) with hw-supported nested paging (EPT) enabled on the host.

In order to confirm this, a colleague of mine gave me access to a server
with 96 GB of RAM, and:

  address sizes	: 46 bits physical, 48 bits virtual

On this host I booted a 72 GB OVMF guest on QEMU/KVM, with EPT enabled,
and according to the guest dmesg, the guest saw it all.

  Memory: 74160924K/75493820K available (7735K kernel code, 1149K
  rwdata, 3340K rodata, 1500K init, 1524K bss, 1332896K reserved, 0K
  cma-reserved)

Maoming: since you reported this issue, please confirm that the patch
series resolves it for you as well. In that case, I'll repost the series
with "PATCH" as subject-prefix instead of "RFC", and I'll drop the BUG
note from the last commit message.

Thanks
