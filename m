So we don't even agree what mirroring the raw node should even mean.

I can the see your point when you say that the raw node has no backing
file, so everything should be copied. But I can also see the point that
the raw node can really just be used as a filter that limits the data
exposed from the qcow2 layer, and you want to keep the copy a COW
overlay over the same backing file.

Both are valid use cases in principle and there is no single right or
wrong.

We don't currently support the latter use case because we have only
sync=3Dfull or sync=3Dtop, but if you could specify a base node instead, we
could probably suport the case without all of the special-casing filter
nodes and backing file childs.

You would call bdrv_co_block_status_above() with the right base node and
it would just recurse whereever the data is stored, be it bs->backing,
bs->file or even driver-specific children. This would allow you to find
out whether some block in the top node came from the base node that
we're going to keep. If yes, skip it; if no, copy it.

This way we wouldn't have to decide whether raw is a filter or not,
because it wouldn't make a difference. The behaviour would only depend
on the base node given by the user. If you specified the top-level qcow2
file as the base, you get your full copy; if you specified the backing
qcow2, you get the partial copy where the target still uses the same
backing file.

(Hm... It would only actually work if the offsets stay the same in the
chain, which is true for backing file children, but not necessarily for
other children. Anyway, even if we don't gain much functionality, I
really want a more generic model that avoids different types of nodes
and edges as much as possible.)
