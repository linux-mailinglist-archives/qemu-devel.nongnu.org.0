That's a misunderstanding due to poor docs.  The bitmap name has always 
been what was exposed, ever since we promoted things to stable by 
getting rid of x-.

No, the feature stems back to 4.0, when we got rid of x-.  There are 
other reasons that dirty bitmaps aren't really usable for incremental 
backups without qemu 4.2, but qemu 4.0 was the first time we exposed a 
stable interface for a bitmap over an NBD export, and that release used 
the bitmap name (and not the export name), so at this point, a code 
change would break expectations of any 4.0 client using bitmaps for 
other reasons.  Libvirt currently has absolute control over the bitmap 
name (my initial code in libvirt created a temporary bitmap with my 
desired name, then merged the contents from the permanent bitmaps 
corresponding to the actual libvirt Checkpoint objects into the 
temporary, so that it could then call nbd-export-add with the temporary 
bitmap name).  But, as you point out...

The unstable x-block-dirty-bitmap APIs _did_ have a way to export a 
user-controlled name SEPARATE from the bitmap name.  At the time I was 
removing the x- prefix, I asked if anyone had a strong use case for 
keeping that functionality.  No one spoke up in favor of keeping it 
(Nikolay mentioned using the old interface, but not being stumped by its 
removal), so we nuked it at the time.  We can always add it back (now 
that it sounds like you have a use case where it may be more 
compelling), but it was easier to stabilize less and add more later as 
needed, than to stabilize too much and regret that we had to support the 
flexibility that no one needed.
