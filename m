I've just looked into v5.1.0 stable release. I will double check this
with -master branch.

I will double check it - thanks for pointing this out.

Having syscalls supporting 64 bit time on 32 bit machines indicated in
[2] would be a very welcome for glibc testing.

Ok.

For me it would be enough to have:

qemu-arm -rtc=3D"2039-01-01" -L... ./ctx
So the emulated "time" would be after 32 bit time_t overflow when
QEMU user space emulation process starts (as long as it doesn't touch
the host machine time).


Another option (workaround) would be to run clock_settime64() with time
set to year 2038+ on the beginning of each glibc test. It shall work as
long as we don't change host time (and all time changes would stay in
the qemu user mode process).

Could you elaborate on this use case/scenario? Do you have some
examples to share?
