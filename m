Hi Rahul,
A good rule of thumb is that if it's possible in real hardware then it
can be emulated.  So in this case the question is whether an I2C device
can be accessed by multiple bus masters.  The answer seems to be yes:
https://www.i2c-bus.org/multimaster/

Ernest recently posted patches to add a chardev to QEMU that
reads/writes to a host /dev/i2c-0 device.  What you are describing is a
little different but related.

In theory it is possible to define an I2C-over-socket protocol (for
example a UNIX Domain Socket) so that an external process can simulate
an I2C device.  QEMU will emulate the I2C controller and forward bus
transactions to the external process.

If you want multi-master I2C then the external process needs to accept
multiple connections so that more than one QEMU can connect at
simultaneously.

Stefan
