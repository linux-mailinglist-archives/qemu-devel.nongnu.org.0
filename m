Plenty.

-machine usb=on (and its sugared form -usb) are just one of many options
that deposit configuration for the board to pick up.  Some boards do,
some don't.  Some boards pick up and reject some configuration they
can't use.  Some don't.  It's a big family of hack jobs.

For -drive (and its sugared forms), we have generic code to turn "not
picked up" into an error: drive_check_orphaned().
