Branch: https://github.com/XanClic/qemu.git child-access-functions-v7
Branch: https://git.xanclic.moe/XanClic/qemu.git child-access-functions-v7


Hello!

This is v7.  Conceptually, not much has changed, so please follow the
above link to v6’s cover letter if you’re looking for an introduction
to this series.

I did say that conceptually, not much has changed, but from a diff
standpoint, a lot has changed all over this series.


Changes from v6:
- Patch 1:
  - More elaborate explanation of .is_filter
  - Changed function names
  - Dropped bdrv_storage_child() and bdrv_metadata_child()
  - Some checking of the BdrvChildRole

- Patch 2:
  - Mostly changes resulting from the different naming scheme

- Patch 3: New

- Patch 5:
  - Don’t rename those functions
  - Don’t drop a comment that shouldn’t be dropped

- Patch 7:
  - Use block_driver_can_compress()
  - Move setting @filtered down where it’s needed

- Patches 10 and 11: New (extension of 8 and 9)

- Patch 12:
  - Function name changes
  - More cases:
    - bdrv_recurse_can_replace()
    - init_dirty_bitmap_migration()
  - bdrv_co_truncate() has changed

- Patch 13:
  - Function name changes

- Patch 14:
  - Variables renamed to be more consistent with the rest of this series
  - Function name changes
  - The freeze backing chain functions haven’t been renamed
  - STREAM_BUFFER_SIZE is STREAM_CHUNK as of some point last year
  - Fix overlay finding (e.g. handle when @base is not in the device’s
    backing chain)

- Patch 15:
  - Added note to the commit message that bdrv_find_overlay()’s behavior
    changes a bit
  - Function name changes
  - Restructured bdrv_find_backing_image() loop a bit

- Patch 16: New (became necessary because of truncate having to look at
            the backing file as of 955c7d6687fefcd903900)

- Patch 17:
  - Function name changes
  - The freeze backing chain functions haven’t been renamed

- Patch 18:
  - Only flush children for which the parent has taken the WRITE
    permission
  - Mention that this is a bug fix for qcow2

- Patch 19: New

- Patch 20: New, replaces “block: Use CAFs in bdrv_refresh_limits()”

- Patch 23:
  - We can only really fall back to bs->file or bs->backing, so stop
    pretending otherwise

- Patch 24:
  - Rebase conflicts

- Patches 25, 26, 27, and 28: New, they replace “block: Fix
  bdrv_get_allocated_file_size's fallback”

- Patch 29:
  - Function name changes

- Patch 30: New, split out from the next patch

- Patch 31:
  - Function name changes
  - bdrv_skip_implicit_filters() can deal with NULL arguments, so don’t
    wrap it in an “if (bs) {}” block
  - For bdrv_query_bds_stats(), the bs->file part has been split into
    the preceding patch (patch 30)
  - Addional actual-size line in the iotest output thanks to patch 28

- Patch 32: New

- Patch 33:
  - Additional note in the QAPI documentation concerning @replaces (that
    by default, the first non-implicit node on @device is replaced)
    - Move that skippage of implicit nodes to blockdev_mirror_common()
      (from qmp_drive_mirror() and qmp_blockdev_mirror())
  - Function name changes
  - Rename s/source/target_backing_bs/ in qmp_drive_mirror(), because
    that’s better
  - Don’t disallow mirroring through filters with sync=top

- Patch 34:
  - Function name changes
  - There is backup-top.c to care about, too, now

- Patch 35:
  - Function name changes
  - Call bdrv_commit() even for nodes that do not have backing files so
    we get an error
  - s/above_base/base_overlay/

- Patch 36:
  - Function name changes

- Patch 37:
  - Function name changes
  - In img_convert(), when inquiring target_backing_sectors, use
    bdrv_backing_chain_next() instead of bdrv_cow_bs() (because @out_bs
    may be a filter)
  - Forgot to use the backing file of @unfiltered_bs for
    bdrv_is_allocated_above() in img_rebase() (instead of @unfiltered_bs
    itself), fixed

- Patch 39:
  - Function name changes

- Patch 40:
  - Function name changes
  - There are backup-top and filter-compress now

- Patch 41:
  - Make bdrv_backing_overridden() globally available, so block/qapi.c
    can use it to determine whether we can inquire bs->backing’s format
    to get the backing_format
  - Function name changes

- Patch 42: New

- Patch 43:
  - Rebase conflicts

- Patch 44:
  - Create a dedicated do_test_io() function
  - Don’t unnecessarily clear and pass has_quit
  - Drop assert_no_active_block_jobs() that does very little
  - Additional graph constraint check
  - Rebase conflict in the reference output

- Patch 45:
  - Rebase conflict in the reference output

- Patch 46:
  - Use _rm_test_img rather than rm -f
  - Skip one of the test cases when IMGOPTS asks for a data_file

- Patch 47:
  - Rebase conflict in the reference output


Patches removed:
- The whole check_to_replace_node() stuff for mirror (was its own
  series)

- Making bdrv_get_cumulative_perm() public, because it already was

- bdrv_storage_child() (was replaced by child roles)
