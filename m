Libvirt can easily work around it for new VMs, and it should.

The issue are VMs that were created with QEMU 3.1.0.  QEMU 3.1.0
was telling libvirt "Icelake-Server can't be used unless
pconfig=off is used", and libvirt was adding pconfig=off to the
domain XML as expected.

It would be wrong for libvirt to remove a device option when
migrating an existing VM to another QEMU version.  We can change
the rules (and document that), but do we want to?
