Hello, Liu.

I will not answer your questions directly, however I want to bring to you
and others another perspective on this situation.

First, please provide the link to the specifications. Via Google, I found
that "riscv-v-spec-0.7.1" is titled "Working draft of the proposed RISC-V V
vector extension". I could not find "riscv-p-spec-0.5".

I am not sure what the QEMU policy towards "working draft proposal" type of
specification is. Peter, can you perhaps clarify that or any other related
issue?

I would advice some caution in these cases. The major issue is backward
compatibility, but there are other issues too. Let's say, fairness. If we
let emulation of a component based on a "working draft proposal" be
integrated into QEMU, this will set a precedent, and many other developer
would rightfully ask for their contributions based on drafts to be
integrated into QEMU. Our policy should be as equal as possible to all
contribution, large or small, riscv or alpha, cpu or device, tcg or kvm -
in my honest opinion. QEMU upstream should not be a collecting place for
all imaginable experimentations, certain criteria on what is appropriate
for upstreaming exist and must continue to exist.

Yours,
Aleksandar
