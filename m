Event though management software seems to be capable of it, a failover
implementation has never happened. As Michael says network failover is
a mechanism (there's no good reason not to use a PT device if it is
available), not a policy. We are now trying to implement it in a
simple way, contained within QEMU.

This is something that I can work on as well, but it doesn't have to
be part of this patch set in my opinion. Let's say migration fails and we can't
re-plug the primary device. We can still use the standby (virtio-net)
device which would only mean slower networking. How likely is it that
the primary device is grabbed by another VM between unplugging and
migration failure anyway?
