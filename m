Yes, machine-generated configuration is more verbose than what humans
produce.  Machines like it explicit.  It's simpler for them than relying
on defaults.  Bonus: immunity to changing defaults.

But no, verbosity is not the core problem, it merely aggravates the core
problem.  Complex configuration is much harder to read in a CLI syntax
than in a half-decent config file.  Yes, it's prohibitively harder just
for lengthy configurations.  That doesn't make it not harder for short
configurations.

It's what I had to do to secure a beach head for QAPI on the command
line coast.

Design thread:

    Subject: Non-flat command line option argument syntax
    Date: Thu, 02 Feb 2017 20:42:33 +0100
    Message-ID: <87bmukmlau.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>
    https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-02/msg00555.html

A few quick quotes:

* On JSON vs. dotted keys in CLI: "both variants are basically
  illegible.  This is simply something that belongs into a config file
  rather than the command line.  In a config file, JSON would be a
  better choice."

* On dotted keys vs. structured values: "dotted keys are weird and ugly,
  but at least they don't add to the quoting mess.  Structured values
  look better, except when they do add to the quoting mess.  I'm having
  a hard time deciding which one I like less :)"

* Final verdict: "the whole non-flat command line argument design has
  been an exercise in picking what I dislike least."

> I think if we want, we can still evolve our human syntax to be more user
> friendly. My impression was that we don't want to.

Correct.

Quote from the design thread on disambiguating scalars, but I feel the
gist of it applies more widely:

    * When it breaks, fall back to JSON

      Tolerable if it breaks pretty much only in obscure corner cases.

    * More syntax

      Add syntax to disambiguate the type (key sigils?).  Has to be optiona=
l
      for backward compatibility reasons.  When omitting type information
      breaks, you have to supply it, or fall back to JSON.

      More syntax for use in obscure cases is about the last thing the QEMU
      command line needs.

    * More magic

      Make the keyval variant of the QObject input visitor shift the
      breakage to hopefully less common cases.

      - Empty list magic

        When the visitor is asked for a list, and the list's key wasn't
        specified, return an empty list instead of failure.  Unbreaks empty
        list, breaks absent optional list.

      - Alternate magic

        When the visitor is asked for an alternate, pick the alternate's
        variant based on the value rather than the type for scalar values
        (the type is always 'str' then).  Unbreaks alternates when this
        picks the variant you want, breaks them when you really want 'str'.

      - Possibly more

      When the magic breaks, fall back to JSON.

      More magic in the QEMU command line feels even worse to me than more
      syntax.

JSON is by design a data interchange format.  We (and others) pressed it
into a configuration file role.  PITA ensues.  Crockford shrugs.

Suitable tooling can reduce it.

True: YAML provides only string scalars.

TOML provides strings, integers, floats, booleans, and several flavors
of time.  It lacks null.

There is a reasonable way to keep it in my file system, though.  I find
that decidedly superior.
