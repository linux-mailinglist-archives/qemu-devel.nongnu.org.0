Other things I want to document here based on an IRC conversation with Dave=
:

Our notion of reconnect-delay has a baked-in notion of timeout, but=20
selecting the right timeout can be difficult (how do you know it is long=20
enough to catch all the cases you care about where recovery will work,=20
but not so long that waiting for an actual timeout is not going to be=20
painful when recovery is not possible).  And the qemu block layer=20
already has the notion of pausing the guest on certain errors (whether=20
that be just on ENOSPC, or on all errors), to give the management all=20
the time it needs to resolve the problem and then resume the guest.

There's also the issue of TCP timeouts - if the server manages to send=20
shutdown(SHUT_WR) before the connection dies, the client gets an instant=20
EOF and can be pretty responsive to the need to start the retry cycle.=20
But if the connection dies without a clean shutdown, the client may be=20
stuck waiting several seconds for a TCP timeout to occur before=20
realizing that things are down (use of TCP keep-alive may or may not=20
help here) - management apps may be able to figure out from other means=20
when an NBD server is having issues long before qemu itself sees the TCP=20
connection go down.  In that case, having a way for the client to=20
trigger shutdown(SHUT_RD) in order to speed up disconnection, rather=20
than waiting for a TCP timeout, can come in handy.

Or, if we have a multipath scenario, where we know that several IP=20
addresses will serve the same underlying storage, we may just need a way=20
to reopen an existing NBD blockdev but with a different IP address to=20
the server.

All of this implies we may want to add a QMP command to force a given=20
NBD blockdev to attempt a reconnect now, rather than having to wait for=20
a TCP connection death to let us know that a reconnect is the only way=20
forward, or even as a way to make sure that we can resume the guest=20
after it was paused due to I/O error.  I don't know if the existing=20
'x-blockdev-reopen' can be extended to cover our needs, or if we need=20
something completely new.
