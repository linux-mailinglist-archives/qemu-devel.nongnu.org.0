This code does not change the path client is passing in and we are
already doing the checks on passed in paths/names. So existing checks
should work even for this case, isn't it?

lo_lookup() {
    if (strchr(name, '/')) {
        fuse_reply_err(req, EINVAL);
        return;
    }
}

lo_do_lookup() {
    /* Do not allow escaping root directory */
    if (dir == &lo->root && strcmp(name, "..") == 0) {
        name = ".";
    }
}

Even if escape is possible, its no different than a malicious user
application running. Given sandbox=none can be used in case of
unpriviliged mode, that means user app can only affect files owned by
that user.

Given we are not doing chroot()/pivot_root(), key question will be
what additional path we are enabling using which one can escape
out of this shared directory.

Having said that, In case of unpriviliged mode, it feels that chroot()
is more of a nice to have kind of functionality. Even if guest manages
to break out of shared directory, impact is equivalent to user running a
malicious app directly. 

If doing chroot/pivot_root is must, then we need additional capabilities.
And that probably means we need to launch virtiofsd in a user namespace
with required caps. And that will fall back into the territory of
running virtiofsd in a user namespace. That indeed is an important
use case which needs to be solved.

Thanks
Vivek
