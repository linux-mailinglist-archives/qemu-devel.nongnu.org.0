We already have this pattern all over the place with functions returning
non-null pointers on success, null pointer on failure.

C sucks :)

Conventions help mitigate.  Here's one: when fun() returns
non-negative/negative on success/error, always use

    fun(...) < 0

or

    fun(...) >=3D 0

to check.  I dislike the latter.

When returns 0/negative, always use

    fun(...) < 0

Avoid

    fun(...) >=3D 0

because that suggests it could return a positive value, which is wrong.

Avoid

    fun(...)

because that requires the reader to know the return type.

When its returns non-null/null or true/false on success/failure, always
use

    !fun(...)

Avoid

    fun(...)

because that requires the reader to know the return type.

Note that we have a usable check for failure in all cases.  Goes well
with the habit to handle errors like this whenever practical

    if (failed) {
        handle failure
        bail out
    }
    handle success

Can you give an example?

lse is not an error, but just negative answer on some question.

For what it's worth, GLib specifically advises against such function
contracts:

    By convention, if you return a boolean value indicating success then
    TRUE means success and FALSE means failure.  Avoid creating
    functions which have a boolean return value and a GError parameter,
    but where the boolean does something other than signal whether the
    GError is set.  Among other problems, it requires C callers to
    allocate a temporary error.  Instead, provide a "gboolean *" out
    parameter.  There are functions in GLib itself such as
    g_key_file_has_key() that are deprecated because of this.
