Preserving original VMware terminology makes sense and is preferred in 
my opinion. I think diverging from it is more confusing.

I could do the latter alternative but why? It just hides information 
original patch author (myself) know about where this value comes from.
I don't see a reason to hide information from future code maintainers. 
Similar to defining all flags of a given flag-field even if we use only 
a subset of it.
