My concern is what becomes of "make check-acceptance".  Should we introduce
another target, say, "make check-acceptance-ci" or just change its meaning
and reuse it?

OK, so this matches the idea of carefully curating a set of tests for
CI.  WRT white or blacklisting, I favor the approach that requires the
least effort from the developer to have its test enabled, so I'd go
with blacklisting.  I fear that simple tests will just sit on the repo
without being properly exercised if we need to whitelist them.

But, I'll certainly and gladly accept the majority's opinion here. =20
