Linux offers a Co-developed-by, some QEMU developers started to use it.

   Co-developed-by: states that the patch was co-created by multiple
   developers; it is a used to give attribution to co-authors (in
   addition to the author attributed by the From: tag) when several
   people work on a single patch. Since Co-developed-by: denotes
   authorship, every Co-developed-by: must be immediately followed
   by a Signed-off-by: of the associated co-author. Standard sign-off
   procedure applies, i.e. the ordering of Signed-off-by: tags should
   reflect the chronological history of the patch insofar as possible,
   regardless of whether the author is attributed via From: or
   Co-developed-by:. Notably, the last Signed-off-by: must always be
   that of the developer submitting the patch.
