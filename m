Public bug reported:

I use qemu-i386 with IntelHaxm on Windows 10 x64 host with Windows 7 x86 gu=
est. I run the guest till OS loads and create a snapshot with savevm, then =
close qemu, run it again and try to load the snapshot with loadvm. The gues=
t crashes or freezes. I dumped registers on snapshot creation and loading (=
in Haxm) and found that they are different.
When returning from Haxm in hax_vcpu_hax_exec, there is no regular register=
 read. I found hax_arch_get_registers function which reads registers from H=
axm and is called from a synchronization procedure. I placed a breakpoint o=
n it, ran qemu and found that it is hit one time during guest OS boot. Exac=
tly these registers where saved in the snapshot.
