This can be said about any user space functionality.

The HW virtio-net presumably still has a PF and hopefully reprs for
VFs, so why can't it attach the program there?

No idea what you mean by this.

SmartNIC with a multi-core 64bit ARM CPUs is as much of a host as=20
is the x86 hypervisor side. This set turns the kernel into a uAPI
forwarder.

3 years ago my answer to this proposal would have been very different.
Today after all the CPU bugs it seems like the SmartNICs (which are=20
just another CPU running proprietary code) may just take off..

I presume you mean TC offloads? In virtualization there is inherently a
hypervisor which will receive the request, be it an IO hub/SmartNIC or
the traditional hypervisor on the same CPU.

The ACL/routing offloads differ significantly, because it's either the=20
driver that does all the HW register poking directly or the complexity
of programming a rule into a HW table is quite low.

Same is true for the NFP BPF offload, BTW, the driver does all the
heavy lifting and compiles the final machine code image.

You can't say verifying and JITing BPF code into machine code entirely
in the hypervisor is similarly simple.

So no, there is a huge difference.

You can re-JIT or JIT for SmartNIC..? Having the BPF bytecode does not
guarantee migration either, if the environment is expected to be
running different version of HW and SW. But yes, JITing in the guest
kernel when you don't know what to JIT for may be hard, I was just
saying that I don't mean to discourage people from implementing
sandboxes which run JITed code on SmartNICs. My criticism is (as
always?) against turning the kernel into a one-to-one uAPI forwarder
into unknown platform code.

For cloud use cases I believe the higher layer should solve this.
