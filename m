I request that

- Phil be listed please as another maintainer (so there are two people
that can send pull requests, if a 3rd person needs to patch this file
for whatever reason),

- Dan be listed please *at least* as an "R" person; the business logic
written up under the @Firmware element, and lots of the initial review
comments (in particular the suggestion to mention specific QEMU command
line switches in the schema), had come from him.

If Dan is willing to be an "M", then we can collapse both of my above
requests into one, and Phil wouldn't have to be listed (Dan could both
review suggested changes and submit pull requests). However, I'm raising
this only as a technical possibility; what really matters to me is that
Dan be CC'd on suggested changes, and that someone other than me can
submit PRs if necessary.

Thanks!
Laszlo
