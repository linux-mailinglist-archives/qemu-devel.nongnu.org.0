OK so after those late attempts to get it in, I agree with you. If it
missed the deadline already then let's stick to the process and try to
get this just after 4.1.

I have just checked migration and it fails between a qemu 4.1 and qemu
4.0 with

"qemu-system-aarch64: Unknown savevm section or instance 'acpi-ged' 0.
Make sure that your current VM setup matches your saved VM setup,
including any hotplugged devices
qemu-system-aarch64: load of migration failed: Invalid argument"

so we would need to have a no_acpi_dev class field to avoid using the
GED device < 4.1 I think.

+ troubles with the DSDT ref files / bios-tables-test.c to be fixed.

Thanks

Eric
