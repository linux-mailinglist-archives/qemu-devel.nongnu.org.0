Can you still reproduce this issue with the latest version of QEMU?
Looking at
https://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dcommitdiff;h=3D0723cc8a5558c94388 for
example, it might have been fixed since QEMU v4.2...

Title:
  -cpu haswell / broadwell have no MONITOR in features1

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  In qemu 2.9.0 if you run

      qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu Broadwell (or Haswell)

  then the CPU features1 flag include the SSE3 bit, but do NOT include
  the MONITOR/MWAIT bit.  This is so even when the host includes the
  features.

  =

  Additionally, running qemu in this manner results in several error messag=
es:

  warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.fma [bit 12]
  warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.01H:ECX.pcid [bit 1=

  warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.3dnow=
prefetch

  =

  (Among possible other uses, the lack of the MONITOR feature bit causes Ne=
tBSD to fall-back on a
  check-and-pause loop while an application CPU is waiting to be told to pr=
oceed by the boot CPU.)
