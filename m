I don't think that it makes sense to re-invent the wheel yet another
time and write yet another TCP implementation (which is likely quite a
bit of work, too, especially if you also want to do secure HTTPS in the
end). So yes, in the long run (as soon as somebody seriously asks for
HTTP booting on s390x) we need something different here.

Now looking at our standard s390x bootloader zipl - this has been giving
us a headache a couple of times in the past, too (from a distro point of
view since s390x is the only major platform left that does not use grub,
but also from a s390-ccw bios point of view, see e.g.
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-12/msg03046.html and
related discussions).

So IMHO the s390x world should move towards grub2, too. We could e.g.
link it initially into the s390-ccw bios bios ... and if that works out
well, later also use it as normal bootloader instead of zipl (not sure
if that works in all cases, though, IIRC there were some size
constraints and stuff like that).

Just my 0.02 =E2=82=AC of course, though.
