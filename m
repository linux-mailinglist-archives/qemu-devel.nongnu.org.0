PATCH 1-3,5-6 are ready.  PATCH 4 could use a bit of love, but I think I
don't need you to respin.  Let's review the issues briefly:

(a) I found a few comment nits to pick.

(b) QAPIDoc._check_named_section() confused me.  I proposed to replace
    it by ._is_section_tag().

(c) I proposed to replace QAPIDoc._part by ._append_line.  Matter of
    taste.  I find it simpler.

I'd like to proceed as follows.  Since my follow-up patch for (b) is
pretty trivial and you haven't expressed a dislike for it, I'll squash
it in.  Since you do dislike my follow-up patch for (c), I'll keep it
separate, so you don't get blamed for it.  Any comment nits that survive
the two follow-up patches I'll address in the first one.  I'll post the
result as v5.

Okay?

Since PATCH 4 isn't actually wrong, series
