Gerd has already queued them (including the requested follow up to update 
comment which I think only cc'd to Gerd that's why you may have missed it, 
but another fix up I've sent adding reg names to ati_dbg.h may still be 
missing from Gerd's tree). I think Gerd can send these via his tree with 
your Acked-by on the i2c patch which should be OK if nobody disagrees.

There's still the issue with cleaning up bitbang_i2c that results in an 
ASan warning which we have discussed before:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-03/msg05966.html
but we could not find an easy fix so since it's preexisting problem it can 
be fixed later. Although, I don't have plans to fix that, only mentioning 
it here as a reminder.

Thank you,
BALATON Zoltan
