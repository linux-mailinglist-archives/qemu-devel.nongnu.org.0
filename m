Title:
  keyboard input while mouse moving triggers mouse failure

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  When QEMU is getting a ton of mouse input events if keys are pressed
  on the keyboard the scan code will be corrupted causing erroneous
  behavior. I have confirmed this problem in the latest version in git
  (530049bc1dcc24c1178a29d99ca08b6dd08413e0).

  After the erroneous behavior the operating system issues a keyboard
  reset which prevents the mouse from functioning until the operating
  system is restarted.

  This seems to only occur if the PS2 mouse is being used as the input,
  the tablet input device doesn't exhibit this behavior.

  The same problem was reported here also:
  https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-562

  Host  : Debian 9
  CPU   : Ryzen 1700X
  RAM   : 16GB
  Kernel: 4.12.0-0.bpo.2-amd64

  Guest : Windows 10 (KVM)
  RAM   : 8GB (1GB Huge pages)
