We've discussed how to handle out-of-memory conditions many times.
Here's one instance:

    Subject: When it's okay to treat OOM as fatal?
    Message-ID: <87efcqniza.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>
    https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-10/msg03212.html

No improvement since then; there's no guidance on when to check for OOM.
Actual code tends to check only "large" allocations (for subjective
values of "large").

I reiterate my opinion that whatever OOM handling we have is too
unreliable to be worth much, since it can only help when (1) allocations
actually fail (they generally don't[*]), and (2) the allocation that
fails is actually handled (they generally aren't), and (3) the handling
actually works (we don't test OOM, so it generally doesn't).


[*] Linux overcommits memory, which means malloc() pretty much always
succeeds, but when you try to use "too much" of the memory you
supposedly allocated, a lethal signal is coming your way.  Reasd the
thread I quoted for examples.
