IMHO it is pointless to use try here as its not really solving the
problem. This is just the first of several mallocs in the process
of running this command. Consider the size is large, but still small
enough for the first g_try_malloc() to succeed. Soon after GLib is
going to g_malloc an even larger bock of (count / 3 + 1) * 4 + 1) bytes
in order to base64 encode this data, and that can push us over into OOM
again.
