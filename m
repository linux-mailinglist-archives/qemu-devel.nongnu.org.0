What's more, we avoid a possible bug where creating a LUKS image backed=20
by a block device protocol where the block device happens to already=20
contain stale data from an earlier use of that block device in a=20
different LUKS image, which could make it appear as though we have=20
populated key slots.  It's unlikely that those other slots would decode=20
the current image correctly (as the stale keyslot would decode to a=20
different master key), but being able to supply the passphrase to that=20
stale keyslot to decode garbage out of the new image does not seem=20
desirable.
