Hi Philippe,

I'm almost ready to send out v3 here.

Now for documentation I'm not sure yet what to do:

1) Where should I place board documentation?
    For example, the information that I wrote on the cover letter with
instructions on how to get the board up and running,
    some description of the design, where to find more inforformation,
datasheet sources, etc. I don't yet see any documentation
   for the other boards in the source. In my opinion, it is important to
keep that information somewhere, such that also in the future
   the boards can still be properly maintained. Can I / shall I place a new
file like ./docs/hw/arm/orangepi.txt for that?

 2) Is is allowed / encouraged to provide Doxygen-style comments in the
header files in include/hw/*?
   I see that some of the API's have that, but the boards and devices
mostly are free of Doxygen-style comments.
   It takes some work, but I think it can really help to give more insight
/ background info on how things are working
   for the devices and boards. But if it's not preferred for QEMU, I'm fine
with that as well.

Regards,
Niek
