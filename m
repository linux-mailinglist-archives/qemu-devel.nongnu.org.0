This assumes !defined(NDEBUG).

Yes, the readability improvement of &error_abort over this is only
marginal.

However, &error_abort also results in more useful stack backtraces, as
Vladimir already pointed out.

Our use of error_propagate() sabotages this advantage.  Vladimir's auto
propagation work stops that.

It's a matter of patching the big comment in error.h.

Of course, the non-preferred style will still be copied from bad
examples until we get rid of them.

Manual conversion of a modest set of frequently used functions with
automated conversion of its calls should be feasible.

For more, I believe we need to figure out how to automatically transform
code that returns errors.

If I remember correctly, error.h predates our adoption of GLib.  Water
under the bridge now.
