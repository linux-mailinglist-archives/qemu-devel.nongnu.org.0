Well, if the "human CLI syntax" is "Feed it YAML documents", that's
perfectly peachy for me, too! We need a good, consistent interface.
Exactly what that interface is isn't really a blocking concern.

Configuring a VM is a complicated process and has a lot of moving
widgets. Feeding it a YAML file is a reasonable thought.

Having JSON and requiring people to type bastardized and differing
versions of it in 8 places _is_ a concern. We can't document reasonably
all of the different flavors and why they differ from one place to the
next. We can unify it. If unifying it means using
JSON/YAML/TOML/MAML[1]* everywhere and abandoning a CLI altogether,
that's just as well.

>=20

Decent observation; but there's often no reasonable way to NOT use the
CLI, so I think it's not unreasonable that we try to expose features via
the CLI still.

However, the docs being badly out of date are a problem. We actively
lead people towards harmful / difficult to support paradigms.

I do basically agree.

I'm fine with getting rid of HMP entirely, I think. It's a weird
interface with bizarre behavior that's hard to support.

There's a few commands in there we just don't support at all, but maybe
it's time to start deprecating one-by-one any of the individual commands
that are better served by QMP these days, to send the message that HMP's
days are numbered.

Bye-bye!

As for the CLI, well, that's part of the discussion at hand...

>=20

Well, sure. The context of this email was qmp-shell though, which is
meant to help facilitate the entry of JSON commands so that you *can*
indeed just forego the CLI/HMP entirely.

If you are of the opinion that every user of QEMU should be copy/pasting
JSON straight into a socket and we should delete qmp-shell, that's
certainly a fine opinion.

I'm coming from the side that I love qmp-shell; I find it useful, but it
has some syntax problems. How do I solve them? Is there a way to solve
them? QAPI is here to stay, and QAPI involves hierarchical data. That
data is usually best represented by something like json or yaml, but
those are hard to type in a shell.

What do we do about that?
