A quick PoC to show the feasibility of emulating the CXL 2.0
Fabric Manager API over MCTP over I2C as possible path to standards
based configuration of emulated CXL switches.  Lots of missing parts
(such as hooking this up to the upstream ports or making it actually
do anything useful), but it's enough to establish this as a plausible
approach. Purpose of sharing this is mostly to let people know I've
been messing around with this (and that Klaus' work was really
helpful :)

The end goal is to enable emulation of more sophisticated
CXL switches that rely on an external agent (fabric manager) configuring
them. One likely common way of doing this is to use the DMTF defined
CXL FMAPI over MCTP binding (message type 7).  Whilst we don't have
multiple hosts in QEMU, that doesn't matter for exercising both
the switch configuration elements, and the host handling of the
resulting events (we can have multiple virtual hierarchies via
multiple CXL root ports - similar to multiple hosts, but with a
few additional software complexities). Note there are a load
of other protocols that we will want to emulate in future (such as
SPDM) but this one was a simple place to start. Note QEMU emulation
of simple CXL switches is still under review (queued behind ARM
support for CXL due to some fuzz in test cases).
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20220429144110.25167-44-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/

FMAPI allows:
* Management software to query switch state and capabilities (part of
  this is implemented in this RFC)
* Configuration of binding of physical ports to particular virtual
  hierarchies (PCIe topologies visible to the host).
* Configuration of the binding of MLD (Multiple Logical Device) LDs
  to particular virtual ports within a Virtual Hierarchy (how CXL 2.0
  handles memory pooling).
* Lots of other stuff.

Details in the CXL 2.0 specification and ECNs.

FMAPI could be enabled via an external interface (and might be in
some later patch set) but the recent RFC for I2C slave mode support
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20220331165737.1073520-1-its@irrelevant.dk/
provided the option to simply expose an MCTP interface to the guest.
(normally it would be exported to a BMC or similar, but meh, that doesn't
 matter for testing :) Ultimately emulation of all the common interfaces
 will be needed to provide a broad test platform.

Note this use of the above patch set is rather different to using it to
communicate between two emulated machines, one of which is running firmware for
an appropriate device.  We could do that for CXL switches, but the
tight coupling we will want to the other parts being emulated in QEMU
would make such an approach challenging. Also the FMAPI is simple
enough to lend itself to implementation as a state machine as part of the device
emulation.

Given I wanted a simple test platform without separate firmware requirements
I've added the aspeed-i2c controller to the arm virt image. There are some
quirks around this such as the need for reset controller but overall the
support is straight forward.  A snag here is that for rest of CXL emulation
I need to use ACPI and the aspeed-i2c driver in Linux is currently not
very ACPI friendly and it may be controversial to make it so.

To bring up the connection:

* Use a kernel with appropriate i2c controller and mctp driver support.
  (5.18-rc1 or later should work - though there are some bugs that can
   be if you follow particular wrong configuration flows).
* Get mctp and mctpd from https://github.com/CodeConstruct/mctp
  - modify the mctpd systemd init as provided and start the daemon.
  - for 64 bit support, get latest version as a sizeof() bug was identified
    whilst testing this.


# Bring up the link
mctp link set mctpi2c0 up
# Assign an address to the aspeed-i2c controller
mctp addr add 50 dev mctpi2c0
# Assign a neetwork ID to the link (11)
mctp link set mctpi2c0 net 11
# Start the daemon that uses dbus for configuration.
systemctl start mctpd.service
# Assign an EID to the EP (hard coded I2C address is 0x4d)
busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.MCTP /xyz/openbmc_project/mctp au.com.CodeConstruct.MCTP AssignEndpoint say mctpi2c0 1 0x4d
# Check it worked by dumping some state.
busctl introspect xyz.openbmc_project.MCTP /xyz/openbmc_project/mctp/11/8 xyz.openbmc_project.MCTP.Endpoint

At this point the control protocol has been exercised.

The following test program will query some information about the
'fake' CXL switch.
