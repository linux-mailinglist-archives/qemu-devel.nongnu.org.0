Syntax that can support such growth would be nice.

To grow a single unsigned number, we can make it wider (but we don't
have infrastructure for numbers wider than 64 bits), or we can add more
numbers (but under what name?).

Dotted keys syntax could grow more easily, but it's rather awkward.

Looking more closely at your "[PATCH 11/13] target/arm/cpu64: max cpu:
Introduce sve-vls-map"... your syntax reflects your data structure:
property "sve-vls-map" is of type uint64_t, and interpreted as bit set.
This data type would have to grow, too.

We could make widen the integer property (but we don't have
infrastructure for integer properties wider than 64 bits), or we can
turn it into an array of integers (compatibility?), or we can add more
properties to hold the additional integers (yet another silly way to
represent a list/array of integers).

I'm not asking you to complicate things just to future-proof this.  Just
pause and think whether you can pick a data type that's similarly
convenient now, and easier to grow.

Then pick an external syntax for this data type.  You may have to pick a
reasonable compromise between ease of implementation and ease of use.

Primarily machines means we can accept more verbosity.

If I understand the cover letter of your "[PATCH 00/13] target/arm/kvm:
enable SVE in guests" correctly, then sve-max-vq and sve-vls-map are
alternative interfaces for the same thing.  The latter is more general,
but awkward on the command line and verbose everywhere.  The former
isn't usable with -cpu host.  Correct?

If there wasn't "not usable with -cpu host", I'd ask whether we really
need the generality.
