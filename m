C++ is another level of complexity.

Replacing QOM with GObject would mainly bring us a more solid type
system with better tooling/features, gobject-introspection support,
and remove the burden of having our own OO from QEMU code base.

It sufficiently hard for GObject developers to allow writing GObjects
from Rust, I don't think anyone want to repeat that work for QOM/QDev.
I don't know how c++ and rust would interoperate, but that seems even
more complicated to me.
