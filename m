Hi Thomas,

FIY, Avocado[1] has been running checks on those arches for a little
over two weeks and in my experience, there are still some reliability
issues (besides the other limitations you're already aware).

During the last week I've stopped seeing "machines" that wouldn't boot,
or severe networking limitations, but things are still not as smooth
as I'd like.

Anyway, I think we should insist on it, and give it a bit more time,
so I definitely agree with and appreciate this work.
