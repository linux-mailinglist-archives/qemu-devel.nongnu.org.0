Both of these would be solved by --target-is-zero, I think.

As far as I understand it, you use qemu-img convert with an NBD source
or target, too?

I suppose it=E2=80=99s always easier to let a specialized and freshly writt=
en
tool handle such information.  But it sounds like if such information is
useful and makes that big of a difference, then it would be good to be
able to specify it to qemu=E2=80=99s NBD block driver, too.

It doesn=E2=80=99t seem impossible to add this feature to qemu-img, althoug=
h I
wonder about the interface.  I suppose we could make it an alternative
progress output mode (with some command-line flag), and then the
information would be emitted to stdout (just like the existing progress
report).  You can of course redirect stdout to whatever fd you=E2=80=99d li=
ke,
so I don=E2=80=99t know whether qemu-img itself needs that specific capabil=
ity.

OTOH, if you need this feature, why not just use qemu itself?  That is,
a mirror or a backup block job in an otherwise empty VM.

That too seems like a feature that=E2=80=99s easily implementable in a
specialized tool, but hard to implement in qemu-img.

I suppose we=E2=80=99d want a dirty bitmap copy mode which copies only the
regions that the bitmap reports as dirty =E2=80=93 but at that point you=E2=
=80=99re
probably again better off not using qemu-img, but qemu itself.  Then
we=E2=80=99d need some way to import bitmaps, and I actually don=E2=80=99t =
think we have
that yet.

But again, if this is a generally useful feature, I think we want it in
qemu anyway.

What I think is that there may be features that we don=E2=80=99t want in
qemu-img, because they are more appropriate for the mirror or backup
block job.  For example, I don=E2=80=99t think we want to let qemu-img conv=
ert
mess around with dirty bitmaps.

But apart from that, the features you propose all seem useful to have in
qemu itself.  Maybe some of them are too hard to implement (specifically
importing bitmaps from external sources), then it might be pragmatic to
write a new tool where such features can be easily implemented because
they don=E2=80=99t need to be integrated into an existing API.

As for performance, well, if qemu=E2=80=99s NBD driver is slow, then naivel=
y I=E2=80=99d
think that=E2=80=99s a bug, isn=E2=80=99t it?  And if improving performance=
 requires
knobs, then that=E2=80=99s how it is.
