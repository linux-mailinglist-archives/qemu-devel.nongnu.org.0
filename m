Title:
  macOS HVF broken with WinXP after Aug 21 2018 92d5f1a414

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I use macOS with own built Qemu to run old XP system that I have migrated=
 from physical machine. My setup is very simple qemu-system-x86_64 with arg=
s:
  -machine pc,accel=3Dhvf,usb=3Doff,vmport=3Doff
  -cpu host
  -vga std
  -m 2048
  -drive file=3D"$img",format=3Dqcow2,cache=3Dnone,detect-zeroes=3Don
  -usb -device usb-tablet

  Unfortunately as soon I enable HVF with first 2 lines WinXP SP3 hangs
  on boot (famous mup.sys). It works fine in TCG.

  I dived into the code checking the differences between HVF, KVM and
  HAXM and my analysis is:

  1. Sergio Andres Gomez Del Real b7394c8394 - replaces explicit
  VMCS_GUEST_INTERRUPTIBILITY checks with hflags/hflags2.

  2. Paolo Bonzini 92d5f1a414 - changes hflags/hflags2 behavior which
  breaks in the end HVF interrupt handling and makes WinXP unable to
  boot. NOTE: This does not break I believe KVM and HAXM as they still
  do explicit check instead what HVF does in 1. That's why it was
  probably not reported and Qemu macOS users are rather niche ;)

  Reverting 92d5f1a414 makes WinXP boot well and work flawlessly.
  Unfortunately b7394c8394 is not easy anymore as too many changes on the w=
ay, so it may be not an option.

  This can be reproduced simply by installing /Users/ono/VM/ISO/en_windows_=
xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974.iso
  with HAL as "Standard PC" selectable with F5 on first run.

  I can also provide fresh ~600MB qcow2 image (without activation key
  entered yet) that is created before boot that fails. No need for full
  XP installation to test that.

  Nevertheless I would really appreciate Paolo looking into this.
  Many thanks for great software,
  Adam
