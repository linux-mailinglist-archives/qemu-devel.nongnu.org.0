Carrying a downstream fork forever is more work on you.  If the patch is 
easy enough to maintain, incorporating it upstream is best all around, 
even if libvirt has moved on to the point of no longer caring since it 
no longer uses pre-blockdev.

Eventually, we may want to deprecate pre-blockdev, but I don't think we 
are there yet, and even when it does happen, it will be two more 
releases with it being deprecated before it is gone, so we might as well 
make it work correctly in the meantime.

Sounds reasonable.
