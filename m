I think the meaning of --bitmaps should be "copy also bitmaps".

This request makes sense only for qcow2 images, since other images do
not have bitmaps, so failing loudly when the source format does not support
bitmaps seems right.

Same for the target format does not support bitmaps, this is invalid reques=
t
and it should fail loudly.

If the source and target are qcow2, and there are no bitmaps in source, I d=

Sounds good for qcow2 format.

I don't think showing "bitmaps: 0" in measure is related to how --bitmaps
behave in convert. If we will have --bitmaps in measure, we don't need to
show "bitmaps" at all since "required" will include it.

If we want to show bitmaps in measure, I think using the same logic is fine=
:
- if format does not support bitmaps - fail
- if format suppots bitmaps, show what we have - zero is valid result when
  image does not have any bitmap.

Yes, the second form is a good example of using --bitmaps consistently.

Assuming that I cannot require a version that support both features, which =
is
usually the case when we have to support different platforms with
different versions
of qemu-img, I will check the capabilities using qemu-img --help and cache
the result. For vdsm case we control the host so qemu-img should not be upg=
raded
behind vdsm back.

Then I will use the supported features. If both are missing, this
convert will drop the
the bitmaps and the snaphosts, and the next incremetnal backup will
fail or fallback to
full backup.

It is a little nicer since we don't need to check the capabilities,
but we need to
check them anyway for qemu-img convert, so this does not help much.

But it introduces other issues:

- we need to calculate the required size using required + bitmap or
required + bitmaps + snapshots

- what if measuring a snapshot is expensive - let's say take 20
seconds. This is still fast enough
  if the entire copy takes several minutes, so having a way to measure
is useful. But users that do not
  care about the snapshot have to pay for this one every call. So we
would end with a --snapshot flag
  to avoid this, and inconsistent API.

For raw file yes (invalid request), for qcow2 file no, it should just
add 0 since this is the actual
size required for bitmaps in this image.

This works only if qemu-img measure will report "bitmaps": 0 when there
are no bitmaps. Otherwise I don't know if this version does not report bitm=
aps
because it does not understand them, or because there are no bitmaps.

Using qemu-img info I can tell the difference if measure does not report 0.

When we started to work on this it was not clear that we will have a
way to measure
bitmaps. If we are going to have support both in convert and measure,
we can check
capability only in convert or only in measure.

I hope we will not have 2 forms. qemu-img is complicated enough ;-)
