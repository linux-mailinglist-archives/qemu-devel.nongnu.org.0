Even if I convince other maintainers it is a bug, I don't think
it is serious enough to require a fix in QEMU 4.2.  I suggest
finishing the ongoing HMAT work first, and worry about this issue
later.

Or, if you really prefer to address it before HMAT, it's OK to
make the next version of the HMAT series depend on a series
that's not merged yet.  Just make this explicit in the series
cover letter (publishing a git branch to help review and testing
is also appreciated).
