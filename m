Well everyone is writing these programs and attaching them to NICs.

For better or worse that's how userspace is written.

Yes, in the simple case where everything is passed through, it could
instead be passed through some other channel just as well, but then
userspace would need significant changes just to make it work with
virtio.

But that's transparent to guest userspace. Making userspace care whether
it's a SmartNIC or a software device breaks part of virtualization's
appeal, which is that it looks like a hardware box to the guest.
