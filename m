Hi, all.

Sorry for interjecting myself into this discussion, but I just want to let
you know about some related practicalities.

Filip is a student that is from time to time (usually between two exam
seasons) an intern in our company, working 4 hours each work day. He spent
his internship in different teams in prevous years, and, from around
mid-October 2019, was appointed to QEMU team. After some introductory
tasks, he was assigned his main task: linux-user support for RTCs and ALSA
timers. This series is the result of his work, and, to my great pleasure,
is virtually entirely his independant work. I am positive he can complete
the series by himself, even in the light of additional complexities
mentioned in this thread.

However, his exam season just started (Jan. 15th), and lasts till Feb.
15th. Our policy, in general, is not to burden the students during exam
seasons, and that is why we can't expect prompt updates from him for the
time being.

In view of this, Laurent, please take Filip's status into consideration. As
far as mergeability is concerned, my impression is that patches 1-6 and 13
are ready for merging, while patches 7-12 would require some additional
(netlink-support-like) work, that would unfortunately be possible only
after Feb. 15th.

Best wishes,
Aleksandar

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think this one is wrong when you go between 32-bit and 6=
4-bit<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; kernel uses an &quot;int&quot; and &quot;int&quot; is always 3=
2bit.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is most likely with timespec I think.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; targets, and it gets worse with the kernel patches that ju=
st got<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merged for linux-5.5, which extends the behavior to deal w=
ith<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please have a look at<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, we already had the same kind of problem with SIOCGSTAMP a=
nd<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; SIOCGSTAMPNS.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do the kernel patches add new ioctl numbers to differentiate 3=
2bit and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 64bit time_t?<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes, though SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_TREAD is worse: the ioctl argument<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; is a pure &#39;int&#39; that decides what format you get when you =
&#39;read&#39; from the<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For emulating 64-bit on 32-bit kernels, you have to use the new<br=

&gt;&gt; When a 32-bit process calls SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_TREAD64,<br>
