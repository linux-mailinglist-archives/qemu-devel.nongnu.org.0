If I understand you correctly, this is what you propose:
1) Have a .post_load() method for VMState subsections that depend on =
kernel capability to fail migration in case capability do not exist.
2) For specific problematic VMState subsections, add property such that =
it=E2=80=99s .needed() method will return false in case the property is =
set to false (value is true by default).
3) Have a QMP command that allows dynamically changing the value of =
these properties.
4) Properties values are still tied to machine-type? I think not right?

I instead propose the following:
1) Same as (1) above.
2) Add a MigrationParameter (and matching MigrationCapability) named =
=E2=80=9Cavoid_state=E2=80=9D that specifies list of subsection names to =
avoid sending in migration even if their .needed() method will return =
false. i.e. We will modify migration/vmstate.c to not even call =
.needed() method of such subsection.

I believe the second proposal have the following advantages:
1) Less error-prone: .needed() methods are written only once and don=E2=80=
=99t need to take into account additional properties when calculating if =
they are required or not. Just depend on guest state.
2) Generic: We don=E2=80=99t require additional patch to add a new =
property to support avoiding sending some subsection in case it =
doesn=E2=80=99t matter for some workload. As we have discovered only =
late after msr_smi_count was added (by me) at that point. Second =
approach allows avoid sending any subsection that is deemed not =
important to guest workload by migration admin.
3) Not tied to machine-type: Properties are usually tied to machine-type =
as they need to remain same forever for the lifetime of the guest. =
However, migration parameters are per-migration and are meant to be =
tweaked and changed. This allows a guest that used to run on old QEMU =
and moved to new QEMU to now have better state saved for it=E2=80=99s =
next future migrations.

Currently we indeed have very rare cases like this ([git grep =
\"x-migrate | wc -l] product only 4 results=E2=80=A6) but I=E2=80=99m =
not sure it=E2=80=99s not only because we haven=E2=80=99t analysed =
carefully the case of
restored properties that it=E2=80=99s property depend on kernel =
capability.

As a start thought, we can start by at least agreeing to implement (1) =
and consider the property VS MigrationParameter discussion for a later =
time.

What do you think?
