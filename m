Hi,

That's what we are trying to work out. IIUC, the problem we are having
is that a mapping removal was requested but the device was still
operational. We can surely figure out how to handle that gracefully,
but I'm trying to get my head around how real hardware handles that.
Maybe you can add some colour here. :)

What happens when a device tries to write to a physical address that
has no memory behind it? Is it an MCE of sorts?

I haven't really ever looked at memory hot unplug in detail, but
after reading some QEMU code this is my understanding:

1) QEMU makes an ACPI request to the guest OS for mem unplug
2) Guest OS acks that memory can be pulled out
3) QEMU pulls the memory from the guest

Before step 3, I'm guessing that QEMU tells all device backends that
this memory is going away. I suppose that in normal operation, the
Guest OS will have already stopped using the memory (ie. before step
2), so there shouldn't be much to it. But I also suppose a malicious
guest could go "ah, you want to remove this dimm? sure, let me just
ask all these devices to start using it first... ok, there you go."

Is this understanding correct?

I don't think that's the case we're running into, though, but I think
we need to consider it at this time. What's probably happening here is
that the guest went from SeaBIOS to the kernel, a PCI reset happened
and we didn't plumb that message through correctly. While we are at
it, we should review the memory hot unplug business.

Thanks,
Felipe
