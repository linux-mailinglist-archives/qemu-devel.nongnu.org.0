I don't check the qemu code but if "a single FlatRange" means 
0xFEEx_xxxx is subject to DMA remapping, OS need to setup passthrough 
mapping for that range in order to get MSI to work. This is not what vtd 
spec said:

"""

3.14 Handling Requests to Interrupt Address Range

Requests without PASID to address range 0xFEEx_xxxx are treated as
potential interrupt requests and are not subjected to DMA remapping
(even if translation structures specify a mapping for this
range). Instead, remapping hardware can be enabled to subject such
interrupt requests to interrupt remapping.

"""

My understanding is vtd won't do any DMA translation on 0xFEEx_xxxx even 
if IR is not enabled.

I meant vhost not virtio, if you teach vhost to DMA to 0xFEEx_xxxx, it 
can't generate any interrupts as expected.

Yes, but from the view of IOMMU, it's hard to know about that. Allowing 
[0, ~0ULL] looks sane.

Right, but the comment is probably misleading here, since it's for the 
PCI-E transaction between IOMMU and device not for the device IOTLB 
invalidation descriptor.

For device IOTLB invalidation descriptor, spec allows a [0, ~0ULL] 
invalidation:

"

6.5.2.5 Device-TLB Invalidate Descriptor

...

Size (S): The size field indicates the number of consecutive pages 
targeted by this invalidation
request. If S field is zero, a single page at page address specified by 
Address [63:12] is requested
to be invalidated. If S field is Set, the least significant bit in the 
Address field with value 0b
indicates the invalidation address range. For example, if S field is Set 
and Address[12] is Clear, it
indicates an 8KB invalidation address range with base address in Address 
[63:13]. If S field and
Address[12] is Set and bit 13 is Clear, it indicates a 16KB invalidation 
address range with base
address in Address [63:14], etc.

"

So if we receive an address whose [63] is 0 and the rest is all 1, it's 
then a [0, ~0ULL] invalidation.

That's a bug and I don't think we need to workaround mis-configurated 
qemu :)
