Hi Philippe and all,

latest master now has all the fixes discussed in these series, thanks also to Paolo's help with sorting out the stubs.

Already there is a new breakage though it seems, this time in qmp-cmd-test.

So adding CI coverage seems necessary.

In the .gitlab-ci.yml I see:

build-tcg-disabled:
[...]
    - ../configure --disable-tcg --audio-drv-list="" || { cat config.log meson-logs/meson-log.txt && exit 1; }

So is this supposed to be covered already?

I am confused also by the fact that it seems that suddently I see much "less" stuff in the gitlab CI, did I miss some infra discussion?

Thanks,

Claudio
