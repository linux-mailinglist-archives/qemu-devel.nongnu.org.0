Ping. Nobody else seeing this?

I can only assume you don't have keyutils-dev (or equivalent) installed
on your system.

This is a key difference (pardon the pun!) between Arch and the bigger
distros. Arch tends to avoid splitting development libs and headers into
separate packages, which might explain why others are not seeing the
test failure.

Title:
  Test failure in test-crypto-secret.c

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When running qemu test suite I'm seeing a test failure:

  ERROR:../qemu/tests/test-crypto-secret.c:144:test_secret_keyring_good:
  assertion failed: (key >=3D 0)

  Host is Arch Linux running in the standard Arch build environment
  (essentially an nspawn container).

  I first noticed this at release of 5.1.0 but it's still there on
  current trunk. For 5.1.0 I was able to sidestep the issue by building
  with `--disable-keyring' but this no longer works (I think due to
  9866a33cbb7046891dec3dcc9ca2015828673afe)

  Any clues on what might be the cause? Not sure how to debug.
