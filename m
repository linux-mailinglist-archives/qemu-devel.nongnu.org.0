I like that.

Some kind of state-change diagram might be useful in addition to the
textual description anyway. Let me try, just to make sure I understand
this correctly:

1) 0/0/1 ---(trigger driver to start gathering state info)---> 0/1/1
2) 0/0/1 ---(tell driver to stop)---> 0/0/0
3) 0/1/1 ---(tell driver to stop)---> 0/1/0
4) 0/0/1 ---(tell driver to resume with provided info)---> 1/0/0
5) 1/0/0 ---(driver is ready)---> 0/0/1
6) 0/1/1 ---(tell driver to stop saving)---> 0/0/1

Not sure about the usefulness of 2). Also, is 4) the only way to
trigger resuming? And is the change in 5) performed by the driver, or
by userspace?

Are any other state transitions valid?

That would be transition 6) above (abort saving and continue). I think
it makes sense not to forbid this.

Transition 4) above. Do we need
7) 0/0/0 ---(tell driver to resume with provided info)---> 1/0/0
as well? (Probably depends on how sensible the 0/0/0 state is.)
