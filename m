AFAIK, neithe TightVNC nor Ultra@VNC support the scancode extension.

noVNC does, for most modern browsers, so it might work if you remove
the -k arg from QEMU.

Yes, RFB protocol is the technical name for the VNC wire protocol.

The client should automatically activate the extension if QEMU advertizes
it, and QEMU advertizes it if you remove the -k arg.

As above, noVNC ought to support the extension.
