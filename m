Perhaps I'm mis-understanding your intent here, but AFAIK it
has been possible to separate VM migration traffic from general
host network traffic essentially forever.

If you have two NICs with IP addresses on different subnets,
then the kernel will pick which NIC to use automatically
based on the IP address of the target matching the kernel
routing table entries.

Management apps have long used this ability in order to
control which NIC migration traffic flows over.

Can you elaborate on scenarios in which it is impossible to use LACP
bonding at the kernel level ?

Manually assigning individual channels to different NICs is a pretty
inefficient way to optimizing traffic. Feels like you could easily get
into a situation where one NIC ends up idle while the other is busy,
especially if the traffic patterns are different. For example with
post-copy there's an extra channel for OOB async page requests, and
its far from clear that manually picking NICs per chanel upfront is
going work for that.  The kernel can continually dynamically balance
load on the fly and so do much better than any static mapping QEMU
tries to apply, especially if there are multiple distinct QEMU's
competing for bandwidth.

These examples pretty nicely illustrate my concern with this
proposal. It is making QEMU configuration of migration
massively more complicated, while duplicating functionality
the kernel can provide via NIC teaming, but without having
ability to balance it on the fly as the kernel would.
