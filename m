qemu-kvm doesn't exist for years, I have marked it for qemu instead.
Thanks Frank for making me aware.

Sean got everything right in comment #6, it can only boot one and that is t=
he first boot entry.
There is no fallback/fallthrough on s390x.

If you stick with global boot options the host would needs to change the
XML to boot fro disk in this case. (BTW that is the case since the
beginnign the comment is from libvirt 3.5 somewhere around zesty I
think).

P.S. if this ever worked it was a bug that is not to be relied upon (but
I'd wonder)

But that doesn't mean it won't work, just not with that XML format.
I've never tested it but I think you might be able to get away with a prope=
r bootorder config.
An example can be found here [1] that you might try (do not implement it di=
rectly, give it a test please)

Title:
  [2.6] Unable to reboot s390x KVM machine after initial deploy

Status in MAAS:
  Incomplete
Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  MAAS version: 2.6.1 (7832-g17912cdc9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1)
  Arch: S390x

  Appears that MAAS can not find the s390x bootloader to boot from the
  disk, not sure how maas determines this.  However this was working in
  the past. I had originally thought that if the maas machine was
  deployed then it defaulted to boot from disk.

  If I force the VM to book from disk, the VM starts up as expected.

  Reproduce:

  - Deploy Disco on S390x KVM instance
  - Reboot it

  on the KVM console...
