There is no "version 2" of the "Lesser" General Public License. It is
either "GPL version 2.0" or "LGPL version 2.1". This patch replaces all
occurrences of "LGPL version 2" with "LGPL version 2.1" in comment section.

Also, It came to notice that some of the files that were edited for the change
were not following latest comment rules. For example using "//" to mark comment
instead of "/*". That is also fixed in this patch.
