While it may be true that normal software practice is not to read the
exception registers for every operation we can't base our emulation on
that. We must always be able to re-create the state of the exception
registers whenever they may be read by the program. There are 3 cases
this may happen:

  - a direct read of the inexact register
  - checking the sigcontext of a synchronous exception (e.g. fault)
  - checking the sigcontext of an asynchronous exception (e.g. timer/IPI)

Given the way the translator works we can simplify the asynchronous case
because we know they are only ever delivered at the start of translated
blocks. We must have a fully rectified system state at the end of every
block. So lets consider some cases:

  fpOpA
  clear flags
  fpOpB
  clear flags
  fpOpC
  read flags

Assuming we know the fpOps can't generate exceptions we can know that
only fpOpC will ever generate a user visible floating point flags so we
can indeed use hardfloat for fpOpA and fpOpB. However if we see the
pattern:

  fpOpA
  ld/st
  clear flags
  fpOpB
  read flags

we must have the fully rectified version of the flags because the ld/st
may fault. However it's not guaranteed it will fault so we could defer
the flag calculation for fpOpA until such time as we need it. The
easiest way would be to save the values going into the operation and
then re-run it in softfloat when required (hopefully never ;-).

A lot will depend on the behaviour of the architecture. For example:

  fpOpA
  fpOpB
  read flags

whether or not we need to be able to calculate the flags for fpOpA will
depend on if fpOpB completely resets the flags visible or if the result
is additive.

So in short I think there may be scope for using hardfloat but it will
require knowledge of front-end knowing if it is safe to skip flag
calculation in particular cases. We might even need support within TCG
for saving (and marking) temporaries over potentially faulting
boundaries so these lazy evaluations can be done. We can certainly add a
fp-status less set of primitives to softfloat which can use the
hardfloat path when we know we are using normal numbers.
