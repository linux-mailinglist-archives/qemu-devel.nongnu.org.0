I totally disagree with your using the term "hardfloat feature enabled" in
this context, speaking about this particulat patch. This may be just
wishful thinking. The right wording would be "hardfloat feature hacked", or
"hardfloat feature fooled".

The patch itself has the wrong, intentionally misleading and confusing
title from the outset. It should be something like  "target/ppc: Cheat
hardfloat feature into beleiving that inexact flag is always set"

Best regards,
Aleksabdar
