Hi, there is no documentation for this mode, but in general the idea was 
very simple.

I want to have GDB the option to see the physical memory and examine it 
and have this option toggled.

This was useful to me when I was working on nested virtual machine and I 
wanted to examine different states of the VMCS12 and EPTs.

I used this in the following commands:
// Enable
maint packet Qqemu.PhyMemMode:1

// Disable
maint packet Qqemu.PhyMemMode:0

It was mostly used part of a GDB script I played with to help me find 
the VMCS12 and EPTs.

The architecture was x86_64.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Cheers,
-- Jon.
