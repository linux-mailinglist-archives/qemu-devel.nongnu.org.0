I hit this when bumping the RAM size for the powernv machine too. In
that case it was a convenient size given the memory layout we have, so
changing to be less than 2GB was not making the model less accurate.

For the ast2600evb machine, the board actually has 2GB of RAM, and
it's useful for guests to test in this environment. I'd not had any
reports of it failing to launch due to a failed memory allocation,
which I guess is indicative of the systems people who use the model
have.

Peter, did you have any thoughts on how to exclude such guests from
testing in environments where memory is limited?

Cheers,

Joel
