looks like firmware bug or maybe it's feature and there is a knob in fw
to turn it on/off in case used OS doesn't like it for some reason.

We need revert to unbreak migration from QEMU < 5.0,
everything else (fixes for CPUID_Fn8000001E) could go on top.

So what's on top (because old code also wasn't correct when
CPUID_Fn8000001E is taken in account, tha's why we are at this point),

When starting QEMU without -numa
Indeed we can skip "if (epyc && !numa) error check or auto_enable_numa=3Dtr=
ue",
in case where there is 1 die (NPS1).
(1) User however may set core/threads number bigger than possible by spec,
    in which case CPUID_Fn8000001E_EBX/CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX will not be
    valid spec vise and could trigger OPPs in guest kernel.
    Given we allow go out of spec, perhaps we should add a warning at
    realize time saying that used -smp config is not supported since it
    doesn't match AMD EPYC spec and might not work.

(2) Earlier we agreed that we can reuse existing die_id instead of internal
    (topo_ids.node_id in current code)
    (It's is called DIE_ID and NODE ID in spec interchangeably)
    Same as (1) add a warning when '-smp dies' goes beyond spec limits.
   =20
(3) "-smp dies>1" ''if'' we allow to run it without -numa,
    then system wide NUMA node id in CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX probably doesn't =
matter.
    could be something like in spec but taking in account die offset, to pr=
oduce
    unique id.

    Same, add a warning that there are more than 1 dies but numa is not ena=
bled,
    suggest to enable numa.

    With current code it produces invalid APIC ID for valid '-smp' combinat=
ion,
    however if we revert it and switch to die_id than it should produce
    valid APIC ID once again (as in 4.2).
    Given it produces invalid APIC id, maybe we should just ditch the case =
and
    fold it in (4) (i.e. require -numa if "-smp dies>1")

(4) -numa is used (RHBZ1728166)
    we need to ensure that socket*dies =3D=3D ms->numa_state->num_nodes
     and make sure that CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX consistent with
    cpu mapping provided with "-numa cpu=3D" option.

Warnings won't help a lot, but at least they will point out at
possible problem when someone complains.
