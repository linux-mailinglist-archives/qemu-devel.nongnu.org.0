No need to defend, you do these things voluntarily. I am glad that you spend 
time on this project at all. I would appreciate though if we could reduce the 
overall time for a patch set a bit, and my suggestion trying to walk through 
an entire set before re-posting a new version might indeed bring an 
improvement without anybody having to invest more time, but rather less.

What exactly do you mean here with working reproducer?

Dedication for detail beyond a certain fine graded level is luxury, and for 
that reason it is designated for projects which clearly can afford it. On 
(sub)projects with low activity and high latency (like this one) it easily 
leads to frustration, which is obviously contra productive.

I don't say don't care about code style, details et al., but caring a bit less 
on reviews would not hurt, so to say. A bit of (invisible) tolerance avoids 
friction and stagnancy.

Hey, no misleading number crunching please. ;-) Three dropped patches were 
never intended to be merged, they were pure benchmarks.

Yep, I'll do my best to pursue your work, I appreciate what you did and that 
you still volunteer to help!

Well, you have already seen and run the benchmark in this series yourself. You 
can easily hit several hundred ms server latency, which is very hard to top 
with any fs driver reading a directory. Ok, maybe with a tape drive you could, 
but that's pretty much it. :) With a 'normal' system the fs driver would 
rather block for something between <1ms .. 8ms, i.e. fs driver completes 
before it would be able to actually see a flush request.

But to make it also clear: it would not bite with the new design either. If 
someone really would see a necessity to abort readdir requests, that would be 
possible without huge changes.

We don't necessarily need to preserve performance for them, that's right. But 
it is already handled appropriately for them, so destroying it (i.e. slowing 
them down) only makes sense if there is a good reason for that.

Well, so you want to handle the relevant 9p2000.u readdir optimizations by 
yourself, and you would send it as follow-up patch set (after this set is 
through), including test cases?

Looks like we have a consensus! Then I wait for your patch removing the lock, 
and for your feedback whether or not you see anything else in this patch set?
