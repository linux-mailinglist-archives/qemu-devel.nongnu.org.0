The next step is to deprecate the weird and pointless exceptions
listed at the URL you mentioned.  Not all exceptions will affect libvirt (m=
aybe most won't).

In either case, we can just use qemu-deprecated.texi to
communicate this to libvirt developers.  MAINTAINERS already has
a "R: libvir-list" line for qemu-deprecated.texi.
