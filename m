Actually, vhost maintains two interval trees, mem table GPA->HVA, and=20
device IOTLB IOVA->HVA. Device IOTLB is only used when vIOMMU is=20
enabled, and in that case mem table is used only when vhost need to=20
track dirty pages (do reverse lookup of memtable to get HVA->GPA). So in=20
conclusion, for datapath, they are used exclusively, but they need=20
cowork for logging dirty pages when device IOTLB is enabled.
