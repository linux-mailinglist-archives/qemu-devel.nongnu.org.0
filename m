Yes, coming across this version number the reader has no idea about its
meaning and how the protocol is versioned. The spec then moves on to
other things. It would be helpful to reference the section that explains
how versioning works so that the reader knows where to go to understand
the meaning of the number.

That is pipelining, but I don't see the ability to "reorder
non-conflicting requests in parallel". That example has no parallelism.

It's unclear to me what the spec means by concurrency and parallelism.

If the intention is just to allow pipelining then request identifiers
aren't really necessary. The client can keep track of which request will
complete next. So I'm wondering if there is some parallelism somewhere
that I'm missing...

This sounds like implementation-defined behavior. If the spec does not
cover this area then it might be hard to standardize it later without
breaking existing implementations.

Do you know how kernel VFIO behaves when the application is terminated
unexpectedly?

My intuition is that the device should be reset or at least fenced to
discard all DMA immediately. With that as the default behavior the
protocol could let implementations use protocol extensions for other
recovery behavior.

Okay. Maybe there is a way to be explicit by saying "untyped array" or
adding "The type of the elements is not defined in this version of the
specification" to the description.

It's fine to keep it. Many protocols have a banner or identifier early
on that requires some parsing. In this case it could be: this field
makes it easy for humans decoding a protocol conversation to identify
the protocol as vfio-user and also serves as a sanity check.

Okay, this was a little unclear to me when reading the spec. Maybe it
would help to have a general explanation at the beginning stating that
the message format is used by both the request and the reply unless
stated otherwise.
