cache=none does not allow mmap in case of virtiofs. That's when you
are seeing 0.

I know cache=none is faster in case of write workloads. It forces
direct write where we don't call file_remove_privs(). While cache=auto
goes through file_remove_privs() and that adds a GETXATTR request to
every WRITE request.
