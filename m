As an experiment, I have modelled non-existing ARM Watchdog model (SP805)
interfaced to the versatile PB platform. What actually I was looking is -
some sort of QEMU library, where I can model new device outside the QEMU
source hierarchy and still be able to compile it using QEMU library and
include files to add support for the new device. If QEMU doesn't provide a
library, Is there a flexibly that I can tweak something inside the QEMU to
generate it?

Regards,
Pratik

What sort of devices are you looking to model? Are these existing<br>
devices or experimental/research things?<br>
