"&mut T" implements Borrow so it seemed obvious to have as_ptr in
BorrowedMutPointer too.  Though I certainly should implement Borrow in
BorrowedMutPointer.

Ok, I'll take a look.

as_foreign function does not create anything, it reuses the storage to
provide a pointer.  It seems similar to as_slice for example.

Sort of, I found the none/full suffixes not really idiomatic for Rust.

Right.  It's just a different way to write the same thing.  Usually it
is a bit more concise because it allows more type inference.

The other conversion functions require taking ownership, and I was not
sure if it would always be possible to do so.  For no-ownership-taken
conversions, however, it seemed to me that you'd rarely be unable to
implement one of the two directions.  I might be wrong.

In general though I agree that the changes are mostly cosmetic.
