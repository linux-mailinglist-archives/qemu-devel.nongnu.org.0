Since Linux kernel v5.2-rc1 KVM has support for enabling SVE in guests.
This series provides the QEMU bits for that enablement. First, we
select existing CPU properties representing features we want to
advertise in addition to the SVE vector lengths and prepare
them for a qmp query. Then we introduce the qmp query, applying
it immediately to those selected features. We also document ARM CPU
features at this time. We next add a qtest for the selected CPU
features that uses the qmp query for its tests - and we continue to
add tests as we add CPU features with the following patches. So then,
once we have the support we need for CPU feature querying and testing,
we add our first SVE CPU feature property, 'sve', which just allows
SVE to be completely enabled/disabled. Following that feature property,
we add all 16 vector length properties along with the input validation
they need and tests to prove the validation works. At this point the
SVE features are still only for TCG, so we provide some patches to
prepare for KVM and then a patch that allows the 'max' CPU type to
enable SVE with KVM, but at first without vector length properties.
After a bit more preparation we add the SVE vector length properties
to the KVM-enabled 'max' CPU type along with the additional input
validation and tests that that needs.  Finally we allow the 'host'
CPU type to also enjoy these properties by simply sharing them with it.

v4:
  - Integrated Richard Henderson's rework for the sve property
    validation, in order to do all validating at finalize time
    and save several lines of code.
  - Fixed 'host' cpu SVE default. It was still off by default.
  - Cleaned up #ifdef's for sve_bswap64()
  - Removed redundant KVM_CAP_ARM_SVE extension check in
    kvm_arm_sve_get_vls()
  - Improved the KVM SVE qtest
  - Renamed sve<vl-bits> to sve<N> everywhere
  - Renamed power-of-2 to power-of-two everywhere
  - Picked up some more tags from Richard

Thanks!
