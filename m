This is pretty suprising to me. The ability to use secure VM mode surely
depends on host hardware features. We would need to be able to block the
use of this, in order to allow VMs to be live migrated to hosts which
lack the feature. Automatically & silently enabling a feature that
has a hardware dependancy is something we aim to avoid, unless the user
has opted in via some flag (such as -cpu host, or a -cpu $NAME, that
implies the feature).
