That is true. The OpenIPMI protocol seems to handle at least some of
that, so it should be just a matter of adding a few GPIO inputs
(power, reset, ATTN, ...) to the ipmi-host-extern device.

I should add some more details about this to the doc.

Hmm, yeah, I guess we can't kill/restart qemu from within qemu itself.
But perhaps stopping all CPUs and doing a full system reset might be a
good enough approximation for power-off?

Thanks, I might send the second patch separately in the next round.
