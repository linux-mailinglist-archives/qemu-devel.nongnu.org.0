I guess I was thinking such hobbyist stuff would fall into tier 2  if the
hobbyist maintainer actually responds to fixing stuff, or tier 3 if they
largely aren't active on the mailing list responding to issues/questions.

We add have a 4 tier system overall and put hobbyist stuff at tier 3,
and abandonware at tier 4.

Probably shouldn't go beyond 4 tiers though, as the more criteria we add
the harder it is to clearly decide which tier something should go into.

The tier 1 vs 2 divison is clearly split based on CI which is a simple
classification to decide on.

The tier 2 vs 3 division is moderately clearly split based on whether
there is a frequently active maintainer.

We can probably squeeze in the 4th tier without too much ambiguity in
the classisfication if we think it is adding something worthwhile either
from our POV as maintainers, or for users consuming it.

Regards,
Daniel
