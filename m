v9:
Hi folks,

Finaly the J-ext spec has table with preliminary CSR numbers.
Rebased and updated CSR machinery for recent changes.
Addressed Alistair's comments.

v8-resend:
Resending to trigger recheck due to minor codestyle issues.

v8:
Hi folks,

Finally we were able to assign v0.1 draft for Pointer Masking extension for RISC-V: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-j-extension/blob/master/pointer-masking-proposal.adoc
This is supposed to be the first series of patches with initial support for PM. It obviously misses support for hypervisor mode, vector load/stores and some other features, while using temporary csr numbers(they're to be assigned by the committee a bit later).
With this patch series we were able to run a bunch of tests with HWASAN checks enabled.

I hope I've managed to addressed @Alistair's previous comments in this version.

Thanks!

v7:
Hi folks,

Sorry it took me almost 3 month to provide the reply and fixes: it was a really busy EOY.
This series contains fixed @Alistair suggestion on enabling J-ext.

As for @Richard comments:
- Indeed I've missed appending review-by to the approved commits. Now I've restored them except for the fourth commit. @Richard could you please tell if you think it's still ok to commit it as is, or should I support masking mem ops for RVV first?
- These patches don't have any support for load/store masking for RVV and RVH extensions, so no support for special load/store for Hypervisor in particular.

If this patch series would be accepted, I think my further attention would be to:
- Support pm for memory operations for RVV
- Add proper csr and support pm for memory operations for Hypervisor mode
- Support address wrapping on unaligned accesses as @Richard mentioned previously

Thanks!
