Public bug reported:

Current Arch linux release, up-to-date as of 7/21/2020.

Running a windows 7 virtual machine (also happens with windows 10,
possibly more OSes), with an nvidia GTX 1060 passthrough, if the VM is
attempted to be restarted, either through the guest interface, or by
libvirt's gui interface "Virtual Machine Manager", it hangs in a
"paused" state once the VM shutsdown, and just before the reboot can
take place.  A force-stop of the VM allows the VM to be properly booted
without any disk error checks, alluding to a clean shutdown, but failed
reboot.  The VM can be properly shutdown using the guests shutdown
function, or the libvirt manager shutdown, without any hangs.  Reverting
to Arch stable build QEMU 5.0.0-7 fixes the issue.
