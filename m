As a prerequisite to using the "vfio-pci" device in QEMU, the user
assigns the PCI device on the host bus to the VFIO kernel driver by
writing to "/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/new_id" and
"/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind"

I believe a privileged control plane is required to perform these
prerequisite steps. Therefore, I wonder how rootless containers or
unprivileged users currently go about using a VFIO device with QEMU/KVM.

Thanks!
