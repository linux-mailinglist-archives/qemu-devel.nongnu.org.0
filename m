I don't see whats wrong with tests/plugins for this. For the upstream
point of view they are there to test and exercise the plugin code.

Shouldn't be. What sort of problems are you seeing?

I don't think allowing plugins to change behaviour of the code is
something we want to consider - at least for v1.

It has to track the information - I assume by a combination of looking
at addresses or looking through the instruction patterns.

This all sounds like stuff the plugin can do for itself. What else does
it need to know from QEMU?
