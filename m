I'm confused... if you're calling a test case "arch-independent", why
should it be skipped on all but one arch?  Anyway, I don't think we
should define such a broad policy... This line of thought is very
x86_64 centric, and quite honestly, doesn't map to QEMU's goals.

I agree that we're being a bit "disonest" by not assuring that tests
we send will work on all targets... but at least we're having that
discussion.  The next step would be to start triaging and discussing
wether it's worth running those against other targets, considering
the cost and benefits.

The "arch" tag and parameter are actually related to the target that
should be used.  I don't see the need for a "target_arch" based on
that.

This (considering it deals with "arch" instead of "target_arch") is
one of the very important points to be determined.  How much wrapping
around different QEMU behavior on different targets/machines/devices
should we do?  This will possibly be case-by-case discussions with
different outcomes, but hopefully we can come up with a general
direction.

Thanks,
