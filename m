I'm adding semihosting support to picolibc
(https://keithp.com/picolibc/) and need a way to automate tests for it's
SYS_READC support, so eventually I'll have automated tests there, but
that depends on qemu support...

Sure, I'll edit the mail before sending. In my repo, I'm leaving the
version history in git so I can keep track of it.

Argh! Just git operation failure -- I'm building another patch on top of
this (for RISC-V semihosting support) and the stubs/semihost.c change
got caught in there. My overall check for changes missed this mistake.

Thanks; I've fixed this file and hw/semihosting/console.c

Here's what the docs say:

        https://static.docs.arm.com/100863/0200/semihosting.pdf

        Return

        On exit, the RETURN REGISTER contains the byte read from the consol=
e.

If this call didn't block, they'd have to define a value which indicated
that no byte was available? Openocd also implements SYS_READC using
'getchar()', which definitely blocks. So, at least qemu would be the
same.

I realize it's really weird to block the whole emulation for this call,
but given the target environment (deeply embedded devices), it's quite
convenient as the whole qemu process blocks, instead of spinning.

I also thought this would be a nice cleanup. However, the last caller to
qemu_chr_fe_set_handlers gets the focus for input, and connect_chardevs
is called before the serial ports and monitor are initialized, so
semihosting gets pushed aside and stdio input ends up hooked to the monitor
instead.

Adding this function and placing the call after the other stdio users
get hooked up means that semihosting starts with the input focus.
