Hi Daniel,

Few things.

- I think scheduler attributes are same for the thread creating
  pool as well as for thread pushing the job for virtiofsd.

- My glib2 is old (2.58.3) and I think that did not have sched_getattr()
  stuff.

- One difference I noticed is that in case of shared pool, it does not
  create extra threads if client is doing one request at a time. While
  exclusive pool seemed to push every request to a new thread in pool
  in sort of round robin fashion. It feels keeping requests being served
  from same thread helps in this particilar workload case.

Thanks
Vivek
