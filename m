Yeah, I think looping in SLOF is a worse idea than migrating the
cas_reboot flag.

But.. a better solution still might be to just remove the remaining
causes for CAS reboot entirely.  CAS reboots pretty much suck when
they happen, anyway.

With the irq changeover condition removed, I think the remaining
causes are more theoretical than practical situations at this point.
