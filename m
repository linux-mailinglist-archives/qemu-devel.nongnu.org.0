Yes, that would be nice. I don't know how it works. Maybe when adding
the next MemoryRegion there's an error or an assert(). No clue.

My point wasn't that the guest would be lost or corrupted, only that it
couldn't be migrated. We'd say "for this, you have to upgrade QEMU on
the destination host as well, or use a smaller firmware", and they'd say
"we don't want either of those things".

Right; if we can keep regressions out (not just functional regressions,
but workflow / use case regressions too), then it's OK to support more
use cases.

By workflow / use case regressions I mean that it should not become more
difficult to maintain OVMF as a result of the patch. (It should not
imply that now people can stuff even more cruft into OVMF, because "hey
there's more room now".)

Technically, I agree. It's fine to run larger UEFI firmware as long as
the default size restriction for the default (or traditional) UEFI
firmware remains the same.

Turn the size limit into a property, keep the same default value,
implement the migration aspects; specify *very clearly* in the commit
message what particular firmware this knob is being introduced for.

... And I'd still be grumpy, because it increases maintenance burden for
QEMU (and possibly OVMF too -- "hey we got more room now!"; see above),
without open source users benefiting from the change. It's not like
we'll ever be able to run, or read the source code of, that 8MB+
firmware image, is it?

Sorry, I wasn't clear enough.

I *know* we're going to see *those* "open uses" that you meant.

Precisely because they are "open uses", they have a chance at justifying
the churn.

My intent was to apply your (valid) argument to *this* proposal -- let
us see the "open uses" for *this* particular proposal.

Notice, in the thread starter:

"We have a need for increased firmware size", "our Uefi Firmware",
"change can be made to open source" --> it's obviously for the sake of a
proprietary platform firmware. Do you feel comfortable about taking on
more risks, reviews and maintenance for that?

(Note that I'm not singling out this particular proprietary guest
payload. I feel the exact same way when QEMU is being contorted for
Windows of OSX guests, but at least those guest payloads are universally
available to users, if the users are willing to comply with the
corresponding terms and conditions.)

You as a QEMU maintainer / reviewer, and I as an OVMF maintainer /
reviewer, are going to pay with our time and effort for a proprietary
guest oriented change that normal QEMU users won't even be able to run,
let alone read, modify, distribute.

But yes, technically speaking, we can replace the size limit constant
with a property, I think.
