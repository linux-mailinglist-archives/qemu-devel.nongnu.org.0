>=20

No. I am not insinuating anything. The OpenChannel device also used a
blockdev, but, yes, incidentially (and sorry, I should not have used
that word), it looked like how we did it there and I noted that I agreed
with the strategy.

>=20

Yes, I read your code. I know you have a header and I also noted above
that "it needs magic and version capabilities like in Dmitry's series".

As I've said, we have time until the soft-freeze to get this right. I
"conjured" something up to show a point. The reason we review and
iterate is to NOT upstream something thats is conjured up.

But we gotta start somewhere, no? So what is so bad about me posting a
v2?
