blkdebug is purely at the QEMU block layer level.  It is not aware of
storage controller-specific error information or features.  If you want
to inject NVMe- or SCSI-specific errors that make no sense in QEMU's
block layer, then trying to do it in blkdebug becomes a layering
violation.  This justifies adding a new error injection feature directly
into AHCI, virtio-scsi, NVMe, etc devices.

What I like about blkdebug is the state machine and relatively powerful
tests that this enables.  It makes sense to reuse those for storage
controller-specific error injection too.  In the future we may wish to
reuse it for network cards and other emulated devices too!

Perhaps the error injection "engine" (the core blkdebug code) can be
extracted and reused?
