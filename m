QEMU sync dirty_bitmap per MemoryRegionSection. Within 
MemoryRegionSection there could be multiple KVMSlots. QEMU queries 
dirty_bitmap per KVMSlot and mark dirty for each KVMSlot.
On kernel side, KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG ioctl calls 
kvm_get_dirty_log_protect(), where it uses copy_to_user() to copy bitmap 
of that memSlot.
vfio_dma is per MemoryRegionSection. We can reply on MemoryRegionSection 
in our implementation. But to get bitmap during unmap, we have to take 
care of concatenating bitmaps.

In QEMU, in function kvm_physical_sync_dirty_bitmap() there is a comment 
where bitmap size is calculated and bitmap is defined as 'void __user 
*dirty_bitmap' which is also the concern you raised and could be handled 
similarly as below.

         /* XXX bad kernel interface alert
          * For dirty bitmap, kernel allocates array of size aligned to
          * bits-per-long.  But for case when the kernel is 64bits and
          * the userspace is 32bits, userspace can't align to the same
          * bits-per-long, since sizeof(long) is different between kernel
          * and user space.  This way, userspace will provide buffer which
          * may be 4 bytes less than the kernel will use, resulting in
          * userspace memory corruption (which is not detectable by valgrind
          * too, in most cases).
          * So for now, let's align to 64 instead of HOST_LONG_BITS here, in
          * a hope that sizeof(long) won't become >8 any time soon.
          */
         if (!mem->dirty_bmap) {
             hwaddr bitmap_size = ALIGN(((mem->memory_size) >> 
TARGET_PAGE_BITS),
                                         /*HOST_LONG_BITS*/ 64) / 8;
             /* Allocate on the first log_sync, once and for all */
             mem->dirty_bmap = g_malloc0(bitmap_size);
         }
