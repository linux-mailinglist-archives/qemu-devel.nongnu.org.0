I wonder if we have a terminology difference confusion here.
To me "CI" means "we have tests which we automatically run
before pushing commits to master, and if they fail then we
don't push". So (a) they have to run synchronously and (b) there
is a need for them to run in a reasonable period of time because
otherwise it takes too long to run the tests before pushing
to master and we get a backlog of unprocessed pullrequests
and annoying delays.

I think the ideal we're aiming for here is:
 (1) people doing active work in the block subsystem are probably
often going to want to run all the iotests, and certainly the
subsystem maintainers will want to do that as they put together
pull requests.
 (2) but people who *don't* do active work in the block subsystem
still sometimes touch it in passing as part of things like global
refactorings or other changes that touch big parts of the tree,
or accidentally break it with a change to some other bit of QEMU
entirely. These people won't run the full iotests, but it is
reasonable to expect them to run 'make check', and it would be good
if that caught "whoops you broke the block subsystem".

Similarly, "make check" has incredibly spotty coverage of
various arm boards and devices, but it does do some basic
checks which do catch accidental breakage.
