So drain_end is different from drain_begin in that it wants to wait only
for all bdrv_drain_invoke() calls to complete, but not for other
requests that are in flight. Makes sense.

Though instead of managing a whole list, wouldn't a counter suffice?

I think I would add an int* to BdrvChildRole.drained_end() so that we
can just increase the counter whereever we need to.

The split between .drained_end/.drained_end_unquiesce feels wrong. It
shouldn't be the job of the BdrvChildRole to worry about this. Polling
should be handled inside bdrv_parent_drained_end_single(), like we do in
bdrv_parent_drained_begin_single(), so that the BdrvChildRole never has
to poll.

I feel this series should add something to tests/test-bdrv-drain.c, too.
qemu-iotests can only test high-level block job commands that happen to
trigger the bug today, but that code may change in the future. Unit
tests allow us to test the problematic cases more directly.
