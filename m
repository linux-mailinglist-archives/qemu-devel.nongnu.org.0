Nice, it adds even more information than this patch.

For reference, this is the patch at the URL above:

-Typedefs are used to eliminate the redundant 'struct' keyword.
+Typedefs can be used to eliminate the redundant 'struct' keyword. This is
+especially helpful for common types that are used all over the place. Since
+certain C compilers choke on duplicated typedefs, you should avoid them and
+declare a typedef only in one header file. For common types, you can use
+"include/qemu/typedefs.h" for example. Note that it is also perfectly fine to
+use forward struct definitions without typedefs for references in headers
+to avoid the problem with duplicated typedefs.

I don't agree with the first two sentences, and I agree with what Paolo said
here:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg586214.html

("I agree 100% with the wording after 'Since'.  However, I think the first
part should be made stronger, not weaker.")

Paolo sent the following proposal:

| Typedefs are use to eliminate the redundant 'struct' keyword, since type
| names have a different style than other identifiers ("CamelCase" versus
| "snake_case").  Each struct should have a CamelCase name and a
| corresponding typedef.
| 
| Since certain C compilers choke on duplicated typedefs, you should avoid
| them and declare a typedef only in one header file.  For common types,
| you can use "include/qemu/typedefs.h" for example.  However, as a metter
| of convenience it is also perfectly fine to use forward struct
| definitions instead of typedefs in headers and function prototypes; this
| avoids problems with duplicated typedefs and reduces the need to include
| headers from other headers.

It seems perfect to me.

Paolo, do I have your signed-off-by to send that in a patch?

Agreed, but I prefer to fix one problem at a time.
