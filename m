Please work that into your commit message.  Remember, you commit message
is also your patch's sales pitch.

Thanks!

I don't think we have any documentation on it, let alone useful
documentation.

Here's what you need to do there for your new chardev backend type,
using your voodoo coding skills.

Find this line:
DEFHEADING(Character device options:)

This is where option -chardev is defined and documented.

Now pick an existing chardev backend.  Picking one that's vaguely
similar to yours is best.  Let's pick "serial", because it also passes
through a host device.

First occurence is this:

    #ifdef _WIN32
        "-chardev console,id=id[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
        "-chardev serial,id=id,path=path[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
    #else
        "-chardev pty,id=id[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
        "-chardev stdio,id=id[,mux=on|off][,signal=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
    #endif

You see _WIN32, and immediately skip to the next one:

    #if defined(__linux__) || defined(__sun__) || defined(__FreeBSD__) \
            || defined(__NetBSD__) || defined(__OpenBSD__) || defined(__DragonFly__)
        "-chardev serial,id=id,path=path[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
        "-chardev tty,id=id,path=path[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
    #endif


Using your vodoo coding skills, you add

    #ifdef CONFIG_POSIX
        "-chardev i2c,id=id,path=path,address=address[,mux=on|off][,logfile=PATH][,logappend=on|off]\n"
    #endif

CONFIG_POSIX, because that's what you used in Makefile.objs.  Your
commit message says "Linux I2C character device", so maybe you should
use CONFIG_LINUX instead of CONFIG_POSIX throughout, but what do I know.

The next occurence is

    The general form of a character device option is:
    @table @option
    @item -chardev @var{backend},id=@var{id}[,mux=on|off][,@var{options}]
    @findex -chardev
    Backend is one of:
    @option{null},
    @option{socket},
    @option{udp},
    @option{msmouse},
    @option{vc},
    @option{ringbuf},
    @option{file},
    @option{pipe},
    @option{console},
    @option{serial},

So you add

    @option{i2c},

I think you get the idea.  If not, the time-honored way to get more help
is to post a patch that's not quite right ;)
