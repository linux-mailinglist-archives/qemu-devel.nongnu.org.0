+Target-independent emulator sourcesets:
+  Various general purpose helper code is compiled only once and
+  the .o files are linked into all output binaries that need it.
+  This includes error handling infrastructure, standard data structures,
+  platform portability wrapper functions, etc.
+
+  Target-independent code lives in the `common_ss`, `softmmu_ss` and
+  `user_ss` sourcesets.  `common_ss` is linked into all emulators,
+  `softmmu_ss` only in system emulators, `user_ss` only in user-mode
+  emulators.
+
+  Target-independent sourcesets must exercise particular care when using
+  `if_false` rules.  The `if_false` rule will be used correctly when linking
+  emulator binaries; however, when *compiling* target-independent files
+  into .o files, Meson may need to pick *both* the `if_true` and
+  `if_false` sides to cater for targets that want either side.  To
+  achieve that, you can add a special rule using the ``CONFIG_ALL``
+  symbol::
+
+    # Some targets have CONFIG_ACPI, some don't, so this is not enough
+    softmmu_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_ACPI`, if_true: files('acpi.c'),
+                                        if_false: files('acpi-stub.c'))
+
+    # This is required as well:
+    softmmu_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_ALL`, if_true: files('acpi-stub.c'))
+
+Target-dependent emulator sourcesets:
+  In the target-dependent set lives CPU emulation, some device emulation and
+  much glue code. This sometimes also has to be compiled multiple times,
+  once for each target being built.  Target-dependent files are included
+  in the `specific_ss` sourceset.
+
+  Each emulator also includes sources for files in the `hw/` and `target/`
+  subdirectories.  The subdirectory used for each emulator comes
+  from the target's definition of ``TARGET_BASE_ARCH`` or (if missing)
+  ``TARGET_ARCH``, as found in `default-configs/targets/*.mak`.
+
+  Each subdirectory in `hw/` adds one sourceset to the `hw_arch` dictionary,
+  for example::
+
+    arm_ss = ss.source_set()
+    arm_ss.add(files('boot.c'), fdt)
+    ...
+    hw_arch += {'arm': arm_ss}
+
+  The sourceset is only used for system emulators.
+
+  Each subdirectory in `target/` instead should add one sourceset to each
+  of the `target_arch` and `target_softmmu_arch`, which are used respectively
+  for all emulators and for system emulators only.  For example::
+
+    arm_ss = ss.source_set()
+    arm_softmmu_ss = ss.source_set()
+    ...
+    target_arch += {'arm': arm_ss}
+    target_softmmu_arch += {'arm': arm_softmmu_ss}
+
+Utility sourcesets:
+  All binaries link with a static library `libqemuutil.a`.  This library
+  is built from several sourcesets; most of them however host generated
+  code, and the only two of general interest are `util_ss` and `stub_ss`.
+
+  The separation between these two is purely for documentation purposes.
+  `util_ss` contains generic utility files.  Even though this code is only
+  linked in some binaries, sometimes it requires hooks only in some of
+  these and depend on other functions that are not fully implemented by
+  all QEMU binaries.  `stub_ss` links dummy stubs that will only be linked

 The following files concur in the definition of which files are linked
 into each emulator:
