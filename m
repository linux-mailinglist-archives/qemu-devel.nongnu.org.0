That kind of goes against the spirit of QOM though and ignores simpler
mechanisms of hot-plugging, as mentioned.

The theoretical generic way would be to discover that any random object
beneath /machine has a null property of a link<> type that inherits from
device and is compatible with the device type to be plugged.

In practice we decided against Anthony's idea of adding tons of empty
slot properties for e.g. PCI buses (the number space is too large). We
did add QOM support for wildcard "foo[*]" array properties though. A
null slot[42] property of a certain link<> type then means a device can
be plugged there, and the property's setter then needs to take care of
hot-plugging and un-plugging.
This was unfortunately obscured by the legacy qdev model where we
magically add new child[0] properties (pointing to
/machine/peripheral(-anon) sub-nodes) to its bus parent during device
instantiation IIRC.

So if we want a new QMP operation, the most sense would probably make
where-can-I-attach-type(foo) returning a list of QOM paths, showing only
the first free slot per bus. That would allow a more efficient lookup
implementation inside QEMU than needing to check each slot[n] property
via qom-get after discovering it with qom-list.

Andreas
