Well, sure, but that's no *more* true if we start from a common point.

I don't love the name, it's just the best I've thought of so far.

Which is kind of... accurate...

That's why it takes a parameter.  It points to an object which can
itself have more properties to configure the details.  SEV already
needs that set up, though for both PEF and s390 PV we could pre-create
a standard htl object.

I don't really understand why you're so against setting the cpu
default parameters from the machine.  The machine already sets basic
configuration for all sorts of devices in the VM, that's kind of what
it's for.

Haven't really tackled that yet.  But one way that works for multiple
systems has got to be better than a separate one for each, right?
