Oh, I've just noticed -- we default to enabling EL3 on this board (like
the hardware), which won't work with KVM, so if you want KVM you need to
disable EL3 with the command line option -machine secure=3Doff

Title:
  cpu_address_space_init fails with assertion

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  qemu-system-arm does not start with version >=3D 2.6 and KVM enabled.

    cpu_address_space_init: Assertion `asidx =3D=3D 0 || !kvm_enabled()'
  failed.

  Hardware is Odroid XU4 with Exynos with 4.9.61+ Tested with Debian
  Stretch (9) or Buster (10).

  Without KVM it is running fine but slow. I'm operating Debian Jessie
  with qemu 2.1 for a long time with KVM virtualization working
  flawlessly. When I upgraded to Stretch I ran into the trouble
  described before. I tried Debian Stretch and Buster with all Kernels
  provided by the Board manufacturer (Hardkernel).

  It seems to be related to the feature introduced in Version 2.6:
  https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.6
  - Support for a separate EL3 address space

  KVM is enabled, so I assume the adress space index asidx to be causing
  the assert to fail.

  dmesg | grep -i KVM
  [    0.741714] kvm [1]: 8-bit VMID
  [    0.741721] kvm [1]: IDMAP page: 40201000
  [    0.741729] kvm [1]: HYP VA range: c0000000:ffffffff
  [    0.742543] kvm [1]: Hyp mode initialized successfully
  [    0.742600] kvm [1]: vgic-v2@10484000
  [    0.742924] kvm [1]: vgic interrupt IRQ16
  [    0.742943] kvm [1]: virtual timer IRQ60

  Full command line is:
  qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -smp 2 -m 512 -cpu host -enable-kvm -kern=
el vmlinuz -initrd initrd.gz -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1.dtb -device virtio-=
blk-device,drive=3Dinst-blk -drive file=3DPATHTOFILE,id=3Dinst-blk,if=3Dnon=
e,format=3Draw -append "vga=3Dnormal rw console=3DttyAMA0" -nographic

  Is there anything to do to understand, if this is a hardware related
  failure or probably just a missing parameter?

  Regards

  Lutz
