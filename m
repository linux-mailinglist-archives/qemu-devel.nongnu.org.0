I see. If this just copies the logic that qemu-iotests already uses, I
think I would be okay with taking it as is for now.

Hm, good point. I'm just worried that the default config will end up
running the tests on a machine type where it works, but if you use the
wrong set of configure options, you end up with a setup where 'make
check' fails because it uses a machine type that the iotests don't
support.
