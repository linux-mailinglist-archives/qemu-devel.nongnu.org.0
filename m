I don't think that any hot(un)plug is safe during migration.
While it's true we hold RCUs as we walk lists, we can't hold the RCU
around the entire migration.

There's lots of other problems;  for example we call the .save_setup
methods on devices at the start of migration, but then call the iterate
on those devices later - if the device is added/removed between stages
we'll end up either having done a setup and not calling the actual save,
or the other way around.

Juan added checks to qdev_device_add/qdev_unplug in b06424d ~2.5 years
ago.

What path does this actually take - does it end up going via qdev_unplug
or some other way?
