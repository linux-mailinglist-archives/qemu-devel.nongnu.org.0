The above QEMU patch, for virt_acpi_build(), may be necessary, but I
don't think it is sufficient.

For the firmware to see the updated (enlarged) blob, two things are
required:

(a) QEMU to update the blob size in the fw_cfg directory entry.

Note: to the firmware, it is totally irrelevant if QEMU updates some
*other* value or field that reflects the fresh blob size. The only thing
the firmware can see is the entry in the FW_CFG_FILE_DIR blob.

To illustrate the field I'm referring to, see:

    s->files->f[index].size   = cpu_to_be32(len);

in fw_cfg_add_file_callback().

See also:

            s->files->f[i].size   = cpu_to_be32(len);

in fw_cfg_modify_file().

That "size" field is what the firmware can see.

Note: *all* relevant fw_cfg files must have their "size" fields updated
in the directory blob (FW_CFG_FILE_DIR). I.e. the requirement applies to
both the linker-loader script, and to all blobs that are referenced (by
name) by the commands in the linker-loader script.


(b) The firmware to re-read the size from the directory, after selecting
the key for the sake of ACPI regeneration.

I wrote:

Thus, the firmware patch in question would be:

But, again, this only makes sense if QEMU implements (a).
