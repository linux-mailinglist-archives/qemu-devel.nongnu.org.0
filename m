I'm afraid we're talking part each other.

I'm not opposed to usage comments in .cocci.

I *am* apposed to noise in usage comments.

Except for the --dir block part, which is even worse than noise: it
suggests this is just for block/, which is wrong.

Fine with me.

If you're capable of writing a Coccinelle script that actually does what
you want, you're certainly capable of doing better than blindly paste
from your shell history.  Kindly drop the options that are specific to
just this particular use of the script.  Keep the ones that future users
will actually need.

Two proficiencies: using a script somebody else wrote, and writing
simple scripts.  Let me try to sketch just about the most basic of basic
levels for the former.  Note that I'm making *liberal* allowance for
reluctance to learn tools[*].

Understand

* that .cocci means Coccinelle
* how to install Coccinelle
* that you need to feed the .cocci to spatch
* that this produces a patch
* how to apply the patch to the tree

None of this I want to explain in every .cocci script.  All of this
I want be explained in scripts/coccinelle/README.


[*] Not a trait I like to see in craftsmen.
