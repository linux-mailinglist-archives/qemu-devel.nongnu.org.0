Hi Philippe,

We would like to stick to this scope ("creating devices in a machine") 
for this particular series otherwise it will become very big and cover a 
huge scope.

We have some patches to "migrate" more devices to be early 
user-creatable (like the last 2 patches of this series) so that we can 
use more device when building a machine. But these are trivial and only 
depends on what is the condition to allow this. We plan to submit these 
when this series is done.

We plan to address other issues we have in others series of patches. We 
do not put a roadmap somewhere. But we can details this in a page in our 
github or in the qemu wiki if you think this is a good idea.
Here are the main remaining issues:
+ the base machine (we are using "none" here because it is "almost" 
empty and fit our needs but it has some limitations)
+ adding cpus
+ non-trivial memory mappings
+ solving backend (eg: net) connection issues

You are right, we do not need this. We indeed use a device tree file to 
describe the platform but this is an "extended" device tree (it has more 
info than needed for linux). If it was not the case, I think it would 
still be easier to generate it from the source platform description than 
using qemu as an intermediate.

It is probably possible but it is tricky to generate the dtb: mapping in 
dtb are not standardized and really depends on the node types.

For example, to generate the interrupt-map property of a device node. 
You need to know the interrupt mapping (which interrupt line goes in 
which interrupt controller) and also have info about the interrupt 
controller's cells format (eg: how many bytes do we need to specify the 
interrupt). For example for some controller, you have specify the 
interrupt kind (rising or falling edge, high or low active level).

So you'll probably need some special "get_dtb_interrupt_cell" method in 
interrupt controllers to generate these entries for you so that a device 
can ask dtb data to its controller.

Bus mappings also depend on the bus type, but since qemu devices are 
already organized on a bus-type basis, this is probably easier to solve.

You'll have similar issues with every mapping. But bus and interrupt are 
the most important ones.

Thanks,
Damien
