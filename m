Alex Bennee once submit a patch[*] allowing that to work, but
it never got merged. I just rebased it and tried it, but it
doesn't work now. Too much has changed in the run scripts
since his posting. I can try to rework it though.

Probably just a misunderstanding on the part of the author (and
reviewers). Maybe Eric can fix that while preparing this series.
