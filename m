You're definitely right here that at least it seems redundant at the first
glance that it kind of duplicated the idea of existing memslot, but just in a
reversed way.  However I'd like to emphasize just in case:

  - The "hole" idea I tried to introduce is not in the same level of current
    memslot, instead it's a property of one existing memslot.

  - The "hole" idea can help us achieve atomicity, and imho that's the most
    important thing that I think this idea brings.  We would like atomicity of
    every single memslot update, however current kvm memslot layout cannot
    solve atomicity of cases like "punching MMIO holes within an existing
    memslot".

By introducing this extra layer of "hole" idea within memslot, we can make
everything atomic now, by either atomically operating on memslot or on a hole
of it.  When punching the MMIO hole, we insert a hole (or expand an existing
hole!  We're still free to define the "hole" scemantics) into the existing
memslot.  That replaces all the previous 3 activities and it's naturally
atomic.

Dirty bitmap is another extra benefit out of the atomicity that we can get.
IMHO kvm memslot would be really more efficient when it represents the qemu
ramblocks.  It also does not really make sense to change slot ids if what we
did is simply punch a 1-byte hole onto a 4G range - the backing ram never
changed, so should the dirty bitmap and the slot id..  KVM memslot tried to
emulate these complexity of QEMU using a single layer of kvm memslot, hence
we'll face these atomicity problems.  So I'm thinking whether we should provide
extra abstraction (the "hole" idea is the 2nd layer, that's under kvm memslots;
we can also think about some other ways to represent this, anyway I really feel
like that should a new layer of abstraction) to kvm memslots to know better
about guest rams.

I'm not very sure about what's the "incremental idea" that you mentioned here.
However I agree with you on above and I think that's also why I think we may
consider to go the other way to add that extra layer to kvm memslot so that we
don't need to have these issues you mentioned.  It seems to bring unnecessary
complexity on the interface and it seems not as clean as the "hole" idea to me.

Yes it would be perfect if there's an userspace solution. I'd be fine to stop
all the vcpus as long as we haven't released the BQL during that period -
that'll be quite simple and efficient if doable.  I actually proposed similar
things during working on the qemu dirty ring series when I wanted to flush vcpu
dirty bitmaps, but I encountered the same issue of incorrect BQL releasing and
I got nasty coredumps.  I also questioned about "why we need to release BQL"
during pausing all vcpus but I didn't dig deeper yet (on the icount and
record/replay stuff, I think, Paolo or Alex may know better).  I'm just afraid
there's no one good solution there to solve all the similar problems.

In all cases, this is still my very unmature understanding.  I really hope
Paolo could chim in to share his thoughts on this too, or especially on why we
need to release bql during vcpu pausing and its necessity.

Regarding RT - I never worried about RT on this. :)

IMHO, "real-time host" does not mean that this RT host must guarantee
determinism across the whole lifecycle of the system.  There're plenty of stuff
that we can't do to guarantee that determinsm afaict, e.g., cpu hotplug.  I
don't think "changing guest mem layout" is a good thing to do during the guest
running RT workload.  It should be easier just to avoid it (e.g., make sure it
only happens before the RT workload starts; and forbidden during RT app
running) rather than trying to make that opeartion determinstic as well.

Thanks,
