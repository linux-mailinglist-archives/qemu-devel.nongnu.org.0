Thanks. Unfortunately this patch has some issues. It fails to build for
targets that don't have the *_nsec fields, such as Alpha or M68K.

I'll spin a v2 with a new macro TARGET_STAT_HAS_NSEC defined for targets
that have the fields, added before each struct stat definition. The hunk
below will gain a check against said macro. This is pretty much how the
kernel deals with the difference as well, as I just found out.

If that sounds good to you I'll keep your reviewed-by for v2.
