I'm thinking some way to verify this from live snapshot pov, and I've got an
idea so I just share it out...  Maybe we need a guest application that does
something like below:

  - mmap() a huge lot of memory

  - call mlockall(), so that pages will be provisioned in the guest but without
    data written.  IIUC on the host these pages should be backed by missing
    pages as long as guest app doesn't write.  Then...

  - the app starts to read input from user:

    - If user inputs "dirty" and enter: it'll start to dirty the whole range.
      Write non-zero to the 1st byte of each page would suffice.

    - If user inputs "check" and enter: it'll read the whole memory chunk to
      see whether all the pages are zero pages.  If it reads any non-zero page,
      it should bail out and print error.

With the help of above program, we can do below to verify the live snapshot
worked as expected on zero pages:

  - Guest: start above program, don't input yet (so waiting to read either
    "dirty" or "check" command)

  - Host: start live snapshot

  - Guest: input "dirty" command, so start quickly dirtying the ram

  - Host: live snapshot completes

Then to verify the snapshot image, we do:

  - Host: load the snapshot we've got

  - Guest: (should still be in the state of waiting for cmd) this time we enter
    "check"
