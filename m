Ah OK!  I didn't notice it's a spec-wise answer...

I guess the KVM implementation of that is still required for the
kernel PIT implementation as Paolo mentioned.  Since this seems to be
confusing and the userspace does not have a real use case for that,
let me repost this patch only so the userspace resamplefd only reacts
to level triggered interrupts.
