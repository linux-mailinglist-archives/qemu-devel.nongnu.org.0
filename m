(5.5) Remove mirror_top_bs from the target chain

The problem is that (5) happens before (5.5), so we can start requests
on a node that we're about to remove (without draining it again before).

Do you really think having a third drained section makes things easier
to understand? Draining both source and target while we're modifying the
graph seems pretty intuitive to me - which is also why I moved the
bdrv_drained_begin() to the very start instead of looking for the first
operation that actually strictly needs it.

I think to_replace is required to be in the subtree of src, no?

Though maybe it could have another parent, so you might be right.
