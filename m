Hello Peter,

thanks much for the catching the problem and investing time into
fixing. I hope to find time for more review of remarks and Xilinx
patches next week. I do not find reasonable time slot till Sunday.
Excuse me. To not block updates, I confirm your changes.

There is another mistake

diff --git a/hw/net/can/ctucan_core.c b/hw/net/can/ctucan_core.c
index d20835cd7e..b90a8e3b76 100644

-    if (addr > CTUCAN_CORE_MEM_SIZE) {
+    if (addr >= CTUCAN_CORE_MEM_SIZE) {
         return 0;
     }
But is should be really harmless.

Assert is not necessary. If there is not buffer at that location,
then write has no effect. Assert would check for driver errors,
but it is not a problem of QEMU and for sure should not lead to its
crash.

So my proposed solution is

diff --git a/hw/net/can/ctucan_core.c b/hw/net/can/ctucan_core.c

         addr %= CTUCAN_CORE_TXBUFF_SPAN;

             *bufp = cpu_to_le32(val);
         }

It ignores writes to unimplemented locations.

There is fix, workaround to make safe writes to unaligned addresses.
They are not supported by actual QEMU CTU CAN FD model.
Real HW supports them but driver never uses unaligned writes
nor any other size than 32-bits.

Reads supports at least accesses by smaller size correctly
but do not support unaligned reads which cross 32-bit boundaries.
Again, actual driver code never uses other size than 32-bits
for read. Byte access for debug dumps by rdwrmem by bytes
has been tested and works OK as well.

The following proposed correction right solution too

As for bitfields use, there is plan to add additional mode to generate
registers header file from IPXACT register definition sources which
would be based only on defines to follow Linux kernel registers
definition style.

In the longer run, if there is time we can switch QEMU model
to use this additional style and headers.

Thanks much for time again,

Pavel
