On my mirror the job succeeded in 41 minutes... I guess you have to get
lucky with scheduling/ambient load.

If all we want is to check that oss-fuzz builds work while keeping green
CI, the only thing that needs to be done is to remove the "make check
check-qtest-i386 check-unit" from the job.

The problem is that QEMU has a ton of nice tests, and by simply building
with --enable-sanitizers, these tests become even more useful because we
can catch all sorts of memory-corruptions. In fact, some of the
regression tests require --enable-sanitizers to catch issues.  When I
looked at this originally, build-oss-fuzz was the only job that was
running with any sanitizers. Now, it looks like at least
ubuntu-18.04-s390x-clang and ubuntu-20.04-aarch64-clang also build with
ASAN. Is there some other i386 build (gcc or clang) where we could add
--enable-sanitizers?
