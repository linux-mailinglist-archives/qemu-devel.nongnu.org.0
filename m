I'm told that Xen for Arm makes more active use of ATS
instructions, so I've cc'd a few Xen people -- do any
of you have handy testing setups to try running Xen in
emulation under QEMU? Configs where the guest (EL1) actually
uses ATS instructions are the particularly interesting point
for this patchset.

(if there's a good set of instructions for creating a test
image I could probably add it to the ad-hoc set of things
I sometimes test with.)
