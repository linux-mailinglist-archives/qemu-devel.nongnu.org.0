Indeed it does. Thanks for pointing out this patch. This seems to nicely 
fix the underlying issue and thus QEMU now work both with and without 
KVM bypass.

Unfortunately I was not able to get any reasonable performance data 
here, because in the interrupt latency seems to be pretty bad (cca 1.5ms 
- 2ms) in all three options I've tried: no-KVM-bypass, KVM-bypass, 
no-KVM-bypass + my patch). So saving one IOCTL does not really make a 
dent in that.

If I will be able to find out why the latency is so bad, or reduce it, I 
will get back.

Yes, that's what I was thinking. But that's just an idea.

I am not against that. If we decide to apply the patch, I can replace 
the two call sites with the wrapper. It's not applicable in 
vfio_enable_vectors.
