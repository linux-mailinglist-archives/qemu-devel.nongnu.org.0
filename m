The challenge is that this is the only auth scheme defined by the VNC proto=
col, aside from no-auth.
If we removed it, we'd no longer be compatible with the standard VNC protoc=
ol. We'd be making use of the TLS/SASL extensions mandatory if users want a=
uth. This could ultimately push people to turn off auth altogether which is=
 even worse.

Title:
  Request to add something like "Auth failed from IP" log report for
  built-in VNC server

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  In environment with needs of public accessible VNC ports there is no logs=
 or other registered events about authentication failures to analyze and/or=
 integrate it to automated services like fail2ban ans so on.
  Thus the built-in VNC service is vulnerable to brutforce attacks and in c=
ombination with weak built-in VNC-auth scheme can be a security vulnerabili=
ty.

  Adding a simple log record like "QEMU VNC Authentication failed
  192.168.0.5:5902 - 123.45.67.89:7898" will permit to quickly integrate
  it to fail2ban system.
