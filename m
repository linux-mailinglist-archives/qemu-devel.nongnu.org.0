We've come full circle. Let me explain:

> Fixes: 536d2173b2b

So this makes me kinda grumpy. If you look at the v3 posting of the patch t=
hat would later become commit 536d2173b2b:

  http://mid.mail-archive.com/20190321113408.19929-8-lersek@redhat.com

you see the following note in the changelog:

    - compress FD files with bzip2 rather than xz, so that decompression at
      "make install" time succeed on older build OSes too [Peter]

So I couldn't use xz because that was "too new" for some build OSes, but no=
w we also can't take bzip2 for granted because that's "too old" for some ot=
her build OSes? This is ridiculous.

To be clear, my disagreement is only with the "Fixes" tag. For me, "Fixes" =
stands for something that, in retrospect, can be proven to have been a bug =
at the time the code was *originally* committed. But, at the time, taking "=
bzip2" for granted was *not* a bug. The conditions / circumstances have cha=
nged more recently, and the assumption about bzip2 has been invalidated *af=
ter* adding a dependency on bzip2.

Nonetheless, thank you for adapting the code to the potential absence of bz=
ip2. Can you perhaps go in some details in the commit message, near "not in=
cluded in default installations" and "freshly installed systems"? If we can=
, we should identify the exact distro release where this problem has been e=
ncountered (and I wouldn't mind a link to the BZ or ticket under which peop=
le agreed to remove bzip2 from the default package set).
