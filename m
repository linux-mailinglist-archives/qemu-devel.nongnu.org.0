One thing I wonder about is whether it=E2=80=99s really guaranteed that t=
he
background job will run under full I/O load, and how often it runs.

I fear that with your model, the background job might starve and the
mirror may take a very long time.  It won=E2=80=99t diverge, but it also =
won=E2=80=99t
really converge.

The advantage of letting all writes block is that even under full I/O
load, the mirror job will progress at a steady pace.

I don=E2=80=99t know whether it makes sense to add a separate mode or a s=
eparate
option just for this difference.  I don=E2=80=99t think anyone would choo=
se the
non-default option.

But I do think there=E2=80=99s quite a bit of difference in how the job b=
ehaves
still...  I don=E2=80=99t know. :-/
