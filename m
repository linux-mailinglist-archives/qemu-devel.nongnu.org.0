This bug was fixed in the package qemu - 1:5.0-5ubuntu3

---------------
qemu (1:5.0-5ubuntu3) groovy; urgency=3Dmedium

  * d/p/ubuntu/lp-1887763-*: fix TCG sizing that OOMed many small CI
    environments (LP: #1887763)
  * Pick further changes for groovy from debian/master since 5.0-5
    - ati-vga-check-mm_index-before-recursive-call-CVE-2020-13800.patch
      Closes: CVE-2020-13800, ati-vga allows guest OS users to trigger
      infinite recursion via a crafted mm_index value during
      ati_mm_read or ati_mm_write call.
    - revert-memory-accept-mismatching-sizes-in-memory_region_access_valid.=
..patch
      Closes: CVE-2020-13754, possible OOB memory accesses in a bunch of qe=
mu
      devices which uses min_access_size and max_access_size Memory API fie=
lds.
      Also closes: CVE-2020-13791
    - exec-set-map-length-to-zero-when-returning-NULL-CVE-2020-13659.patch
      CVE-2020-13659: address_space_map in exec.c can trigger
      a NULL pointer dereference related to BounceBuffer
    - megasas-use-unsigned-type-for-reply_queue_head-and-check-index...patch
      Closes: #961887, CVE-2020-13362, megasas_lookup_frame in hw/scsi/mega=
sas.c
      has an OOB read via a crafted reply_queue_head field from a guest OS =
user
    - megasas-use-unsigned-type-for-positive-numeric-fields.patch
      fix other possible cases like in CVE-2020-13362 (#961887)
    - megasas-fix-possible-out-of-bounds-array-access.patch
      Some tracepoints use a guest-controlled value as an index into the
      mfi_frame_desc[] array. Thus a malicious guest could cause a very low
      impact OOB errors here
    - nbd-server-avoid-long-error-message-assertions-CVE-2020-10761.patch
      Closes: CVE-2020-10761, An assertion failure issue in the QEMU NBD Se=
rver.
      This flaw occurs when an nbd-client sends a spec-compliant request th=
at is
      near the boundary of maximum permitted request length. A remote nbd-c=
lient
      could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a DoS.
    - es1370-check-total-frame-count-against-current-frame-CVE-2020-13361.p=
atch
      Closes: CVE-2020-13361, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c do=
es not
      properly validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to tri=
gger
      an out-of-bounds access during an es1370_write() operation
    - a few patches from the stable series:
      - fix-tulip-breakage.patch
        The tulip network driver in a qemu-system-hppa emulation is broken =
in
        the sense that bigger network packages aren't received any longer a=
nd
        thus even running e.g. "apt update" inside the VM fails. Fix this.
      - 9p-lock-directory-streams-with-a-CoMutex.patch
        Prevent deadlocks in 9pfs readdir code

    - linux-user-refactor-ipc-syscall-and-support-of-semtimedop.patch
      (Closes: #965109)
    - linux-user-add-netlink-RTM_SETLINK-command.patch (Closes: #964289)

Title:
  sbrk() not working under qemu-user with a PIE-compiled binary?

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  In Debian unstable, we recently switched bash to be a PIE-compiled
  binary (for hardening). Unfortunately this resulted in bash being
  broken when run under qemu-user (for all target architectures, host
  being amd64 for me).

  $ sudo chroot /srv/chroots/sid-i386/ qemu-i386-static /bin/bash
  bash: xmalloc: .././shell.c:1709: cannot allocate 10 bytes (0 bytes alloc=
ated)

  bash has its own malloc implementation based on sbrk():
  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/lib/malloc/malloc.c

  When we disable this internal implementation and rely on glibc's
  malloc, then everything is fine. But it might be that glibc has a
  fallback when sbrk() is not working properly and it might hide the
  underlying problem in qemu-user.

  This issue has also been reported to the bash upstream author and he sugg=
ested that the issue might be in qemu-user so I'm opening a ticket here. He=
re's the discussion with the bash upstream author:
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2018-02/threads.html#00080

  You can find the problematic bash binary in that .deb file:
  http://snapshot.debian.org/archive/debian/20180206T154716Z/pool/main/b/ba=
sh/bash_4.4.18-1_i386.deb

  The version of qemu I have been using is 2.11 (Debian package qemu-
  user-static version 1:2.11+dfsg-1) but I have had reports that the
  problem is reproducible with older versions (back to 2.8 at least).

  Here are the related Debian bug reports:
  https://bugs.debian.org/889869
  https://bugs.debian.org/865599

  It's worth noting that bash used to have this problem (when compiled as a=
 PIE binary) even when run directly but then something got fixed in the ker=
nel and now the problem only appears when run under qemu-user:
