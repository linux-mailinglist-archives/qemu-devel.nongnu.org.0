I agree. Good documentation, ideally with some benchmarks, and safe
defaults sound like a good approach to me.

In general, I would agree, but in this particular case the
optimization has an impact on something outside's QEMU control (host's
resources), so we lack the information needed to make a proper guess.

My main concern here is users upgrading QEMU to hit some kind of crash
or performance issue, without having touched their VM config. And
let's not forget that Stefan said in the cover that this amounts to a
1-4% improvement on 4k operations on an SSD, and I guess that's with
iodepth=3D1. I suspect with a larger block size and/or higher iodepth
the improvement will be barely noticeable, which means it'll only have
a positive impact on users running DB/OLTP or similar workloads on
dedicated, directly attached, low-latency storage.

But don't get me wrong, this is a *good* optimization. It's just I
think we should play safe here.

Sergio.
