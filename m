Hi,

Ever since I found out that you can mount FUSE filesystems on regular
files (not just directories), I had the idea of adding FUSE block
exports to qemu where you can export block nodes as raw images.  The
best thing is that you’d be able to mount an image on itself, so
whatever format it may be in, qemu lets it appear as a raw image (and
you can then use regular tools like dd on it).

The performance is quite bad so far, but we can always try to improve it
if the need arises.  For now I consider it mostly a cute feature to get
easy access to the raw contents of image files in any format (without
requiring root rights).

In this version (as opposed to v1 linked above), I integrated the FUSE
export code into Kevin’s proposed common infrastructure for block
exports.


This series does the following:

First, add the FUSE export module (block/export/fuse.c) that implements
the basic file access functions.  (Note that you need libfuse 3.8.0 or
later for SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA.)

Second, it allows using FUSE exports as a protocol in the iotests and
makes many iotests work with it.  (The file node is exported by a
background qemu instance to $SOCK_DIR.)

This gives us a lot of coverage for, well, not free (it does take twelve
patches), but for cheap; but there are still some more specialized
things we want to test, so third and last, this series adds an iotest
dedicated to FUSE exports.


(Note that as opposed to v1, I did run the iotests this time.)


Some notable changes from v1:
- Integrated everything into Kevin’s block-export infrastructure
- Use the storage daemon instead of full QEMU to provide FUSE exports
  when running the iotests with -fuse
- meson rebase
- Some other rebase conflicts
