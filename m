I've somehow managed to subscribe myself to our private LP bugs, so I
get notified if there is a new one.

Honestly, I'd rather like use to move to the gitlab bug tracker instead
of extending our use of the launchpad tracker. LP is IMHO a really ugly
bug tracking tool.

IIRC, yes, the email notifications for the private bugs are still send
without encryption.
