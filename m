Public bug reported:

There seems to be a translation bug in the qemu-hppa (qemu v5.0.0) emulatio=
n:
A stripped down testcase (taken from Linux kernel build) is attached.

In there is "a.sh", a shell script which calls gcc-9 (fails with both
debian gcc-9.3.0-11 or gcc-9.3.0-12). and "a.iii", the preprocessed
source.

When starting a.sh, in the emulation gcc crashes with segfault.
On real hardware gcc succeeds to compile the source.

In a hppa-user chroot running "apt update && apt install gcc-9" should
be sufficient to get the needed reproducer environment.

** Affects: qemu
     Importance: Undecided
         Status: New

** Attachment added: "reproducer testcase, including a script to call gcc a=
nd the preprocessed source"
