That's one example. Also, I see attempting to make/use only migrate-safe
cpu properties for our primary KVM cpu type ('host') as a step in the
right direction to eventually making a more migratable KVM cpu type. But
I do see that (3) is a bit of an oxymoron considering the 'host' cpu
type isn't really migrate-safe unless the hosts are identical (which
should technically require the same host kernel too) anyway.

Thanks,
