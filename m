It's not a question of format, but of environment.

By the time a kexec() occurs there won't be any OF client interface
available, whether or not there ever was one.  So, kexec() won't be
able to exec things which expect that to be present.  That includes
grub, AIX, and (probably) FreeBSD.

Note that while it's the same image, Linux kernels for POWER for a
long time have been able to boot in one of two ways.  One expects the
flattened tree, and an already instantiated RTAS - this method is used
directly by RTAS.  The other expects an OF client interface - it
slurps the device tree out of that and produces the flattened tree,
instantiates RTAS and then jumps to the flat tree entry point.
