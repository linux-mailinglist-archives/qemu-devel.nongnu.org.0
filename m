OK.  Thanks for asking others if they had an opinion about it.  Given
they don't seem to feel strongly about it, I suggest:

1) Keep the developer section as the last section of the overall doc
table of content (as was done in my original patch).

2) Mark the top level couple orphaned .rst as "orphaned" as proposed in
one of my previous reply, since this is what they are.  They will get
built, but won't appear anywhere in the QEMU documentation.

If that sounds reasonable, I'll send an updated patch soon.

Another thing; there was some CI failures with the origin patches I
sent [0]; are they worth investigating or are they unrelated, "known"
failures?

Thanks,

Maxim
