Ok, I walked through the kernel code, and it seems -EIO can happen
- when we try to do I/O while in the NOT_OPER or STANDBY states... cc 3
  makes sense in those cases
- when the cp is not initialized when trying to fetch the orb... which
  is an internal vfio-ccw kernel module error

Btw., this patch only changes one of the handlers; I think you have to
change all of start/halt/clear?

[Might also be good to double-check the handling for the different
instructions.]

-ENODEV: device gone
-EACCES: no path operational

We should be able to distinguish between the two; in the 'no path
operational' case, the device may still be accessible with a different
path mask in the request.
