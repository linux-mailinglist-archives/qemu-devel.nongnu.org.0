It looks like a qemu bug. Booting with '-d int' shows the decrementer=20
simply stops firing at the point of the hang, even though MSR[EE]=3D1 and=20
the DEC register is wrapping. Linux appears to be doing the right thing=20
as far as I can tell (not losing interrupts).

This qemu patch fixes the boot hang for me. I don't know that qemu=20
really has the right idea of "context synchronizing" as defined in the
powerpc architecture -- mtmsrd L=3D1 is not context synchronizing but that
does not mean it can avoid looking at exceptions until the next such
event. It looks like the decrementer exception goes high but the
execution of mtmsrd L=3D1 is ignoring it.

Prior to the Linux patch 3282a3da25b you bisected to, interrupt replay
code would return with an 'rfi' instruction as part of interrupt return,
which probably helped to get things moving along a bit. However it would
not be foolproof, and Cedric did say he encountered some mysterious
lockups under load with qemu powernv before that patch was merged, so
maybe it's the same issue?

Thanks,
Nick

The patch is a bit of a hack, but if you can run it and verify it fixes
your boot hang would be good.
