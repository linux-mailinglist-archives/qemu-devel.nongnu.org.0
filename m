linux-user currently uses 32Mb static buffer so it probably fine to
leave it as is or bump it to 128Mb regardless of the 32/64bit host.

for system emulation, we already have tb-size option to set user
specified buffer size.

Issue is with system emulation is that it sizes buffer to 1/4 of
ram_size and dependency on ram_size is what we are trying to get
rid of. If we consider unit/acceptance tests as main target/user,
then they mostly use default ram_size value which varies mostly
from 16Mb to 1Gb depending on the board. So used buffer size is
in 4-256Mb range.
Considering that current CI runs fine with max 256Mb buffer,
it might make sense to use it as new heuristic which would not
regress our test infrastructure and might improve performance
for boards where smaller default buffer was used.
