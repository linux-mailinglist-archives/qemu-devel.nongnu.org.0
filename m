Let me give you one concrete example as follows to explain the meaning of
``different''.

Suppose a program is running in a single-vCPU VM. The program allocates and
references one page (e.g., array[1024*4]). Assume that allocating and
referencing the page in the guest OS triggers a page fault and host OS
allocates a machine page to back it.

Assume that GVA of array[0] is 0x000000000021 and its corresponding GPA is
0x0000000000000081. I think array[0]'s corresponding HVA should also be
0x0000000000000081, which is the same as array[0]'s GPA. If array[0]'s HVA
is not 0x0000000000000081, array[0]'s GPA is* different* from its
corresponding HVA.

Now, let's assume array[0]'s GPA is different from its corresponding HVA. I
think there might be one issue like this: I think MMU's hardware logic to
translate ``GPA ->[extended/nested page tables] -> HPA''[1] should be the
same as ``VA-> [page tables] -> PA"[2]; if true, how does KVM find the
correct HPA with the different HVA (e.g., array[0]'s HVA is not
0x0000000000000081) when there are EPT violations?

[1] Please note that this hardware walk is the last step, which only
translates the guest physical address to the host physical address through
the four-level nested page table.
[2] Please note that this hardware walk assumes translating the VA to the
PA without virtualization involvement.

Please note that the above addresses are not real and just use for
explanations.

Thanks,
Harry
