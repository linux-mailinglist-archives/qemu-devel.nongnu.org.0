I should add, ReactOS can be downloaded from here:
https://reactos.org/download

The LiveCD is sufficient to see the problem.

Title:
  4.2 regression: ReactOS crashes on boot

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  In QEMU 4.1.x and earlier, ReactOS can successfully boot, but starting
  with 4.2, it fails, instead coming up with an error "The video driver
  failed to initialize."

  This happens regardless of VM configuration (even -M pc-i440fx-4.1)
  and it works well with older versions of QEMU. bisecting QEMU to find
  the first bad commit reveals 0221d73ce6a8e075adaa0a35a6ef853d2652b855
  as the culprit, which is updating the seabios version; perhaps this
  bug belongs there, but I don't know the appropriate avenue (it seems
  seabios is a subproject of QEMU anyway?).
