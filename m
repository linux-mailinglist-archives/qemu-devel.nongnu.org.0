Actually, qapi-code-gen.txt documents and doc.py implements *strong* and
_emphasis_.  Texinfo commonly renders them as bold and italic when the
output format supports that.  rST has **strong** and *emphasis*.

Your series adjusts emphasis markup for rST [PATCH 18].  Since it
doesn't touch strong markup, strong silently becomes emphasis.  I guess
that's okay, perhaps even an improvement, but double-checking the actual
uses of this markup wouldn't hurt.

Can we simply use rST instead?  See my review of PATCH 18.

Apart from these remarks, your changes look sensible to me right now.  I
hope they'll still look that way when I'm done reviewing :)
