Fair point. It's not always easy to tell whether something should be
considered a bug in the external interface (and consequently be fixed)
or just an idiosyncrasy that people may have get used to (and therefore
requires deprecation before improving it).

In this specific case, I'm not aware of empty option names actually
doing anything useful anywhere, so I think it might be clearer in this
case that it's indeed a bug.

I understand. Though I think replacing with keyval will be potentially
less problematic if QemuOpts already behaved more similar.

If I were writing the code, I think I would use existing bugs and
inconsistencies as an excuse to make QemuOpts behave more like what
keyval can easily handle by declaring whatever is closest to keyval as
the correct interpretation.
