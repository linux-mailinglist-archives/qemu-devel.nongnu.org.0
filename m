Title:
  slirp to accept non-local dns server

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  current version of slirp doesn't allow feeded dns address to be outside o=
f given network.
  in many scenarios you need to provide dns server that isn't local.

  this simple patch removes checking for if dns server isn't in local
  subnet.
