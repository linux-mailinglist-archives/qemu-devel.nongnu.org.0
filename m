Simple: it's the "maximum message size" ever to be used for communication 
between host and guest, in both directions that is.

So if that 'msize' value is too small, a potential large 9p message would be 
split into several smaller 9p messages, and each message adds latency which is 
the main problem.

Keep in mind: The default value with Linux clients for msize is still only 
8kB!

Think of doing 'dd bs=8192 if=/src.dat of=/dst.dat count=...' as analogy, 
which probably makes its impact on performance clear.

However the negative impact of a small 'msize' value is not just limited to 
raw file I/O like that; calling readdir() for instance on a guest directory 
with several hundred files or more, will likewise slow down in the same way 
tremendously as both sides have to transmit a large amount of 9p messages back 
and forth instead of just 2 messages (Treaddir and Rreaddir).

Yes, that's indeed handy being able to make comparisons.
