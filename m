Hello, all.

From my side, status quo. Milos (who ironically works in the office next to
mine) expressed interest in modifying his solution to be in accordance with
what Peter said, says that this is doable, but requires a lot of meticulous
work - however, he is too involved into his project for months to go. I am
also involved in other things, and, furthermore, has less background
knowledge than Milos. That said, we in MIPS would like the solution
described by Peter as much as other platforms, if not more.

All this taken into account, perhaps this can be a project for Outreachy or
Google Summer of Code, mentored by Peter?

The perhaps largest problem with that is that the person doing it would
need some steep learning curve (on signals in general, and their treatment
in QEMU), that can take some significant time.

Yours,
Aleksandar

&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0The problem here is we break something to fix =

&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I&#39;m wondering if the series from Aleksanda=

&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Support signal passing for targets having more=
 signals than host&quot; [1]<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0can fix the problem in a better way?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That patch[1] (which I&#39;ll refer to as the MUX patch to avoid =
confusion)<br>
&gt; &gt; does not directly fix the issue addressed by this patch (re-wirin=
g<br>
&gt; &gt; SIGRTMIN+1), but since it basically implements generic signal<br>
&gt; &gt; multiplexing, it could be re-worked to address this case as well.=
 The<br>
&gt; &gt; way it handles `si_code` spooks me a little bit. It could easily =
be<br>
&gt; &gt; broken by a kernel version change, and such a breakage could be h=
ard to<br>
&gt; &gt; detect or lead to surprising results. Other than that, it looks l=
ike a<br>
&gt; &gt; reasonable implementation.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; That said, overall, fixing the SIGRTMIN+1 issue using a more-gene=
ric<br>
&gt; &gt; signal-multiplexing mechanism doesn&#39;t seem *that* much better=
 to me. It<br>
&gt; &gt; adds a lot of complexity, and only saves a single signal (assumin=
g glibc<br>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t add more reserved signals). The &quot;big win&quot; i=
s additional<br>
&gt; &gt; emulation features, like those introduced in MUX patch (being abl=
e to<br>
&gt; &gt; utilize signals outside of the host range). If having those featu=
res in<br>
&gt; &gt; QEMU warrants the additional complexity, then re-working this pat=
ch<br>
&gt; &gt; on-top of that infrastructure seems like a good idea.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If the maintainers want to go down that route, then I would be ha=

&gt; &gt; re-work this patch utilizing the infrastructure from the MUX patc=

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately it will require non-trivial changes, so it may be b=
