Hm, yes, we need to do this for METADATA and FALLOC preallocation at
least. I think we already guarantee zeros for FULL, do we?

Resize needs zero init in the opposite case: When you are resizing a
short backing file, the longer overlay still needs to read the same
zeros it read before after EOF of the backing file. This one sounds
actually even nastier to fix than what this series does. :-/

Anyway, maybe instead of the no_fallback parameter I introduced in v3,
what we really want is a need_zero_init parameter that only commit jobs
set for now? Or actually add a new preallocation mode like you suggested
that would add a zero write and pass OFF to the driver implementations.
Then we wouldn't have to add a new parameter everywhere.

We'd still unconditionally write zeros where it's necessary to allocate
blocks to cover the backing file (and to provide correct data to the
overlay if we ever figure out how to check this condition). I think I've
come to the conclusion that blocking on block_resize is better than
failing.

> What formats are that bad?

You mean that they don't have zero init? The usual suspect for bad image
formats is raw, but fortunately that doesn't support backing files. So
maybe it's not a problem we would see in practice.
