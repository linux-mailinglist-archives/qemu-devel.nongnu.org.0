I don't have any insight into the particular problem cause. I do very
vaguely recall some previous bug I've seen related to AMD/topoext but
don't recall the details.

The single best advice though is to **NOT** use the 'kvm64' CPU
model. This is an *awful* CPU model that IIRC represents the lowest
common denominator of the first generation of x86 CPUs with hardware
virt.  Trying to take an old CPU model and turn on an arbitarary
set of extra features is well know to cause bugs.

See our guidance on CPU models to use for AMD hosts:

https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html#preferred_005fcpu_005fmodels_0=
05famd_005fx86

Essentially either use host passthrough, or use a plain named CPU model.
Only very few individual features make sense as extra things to turn
on above what the named CPU model supports. Mostly this is just side
channel vulnerability fixes, and a couple of perf related things like
pdpe1gb for huge page enablement as described in the above doc.

Daniel
