I'd also mention that we want to enforce 8-byte alignment in this cover 
letter.

For version 2, the header is exactly 72 bytes in length, and finishes here.
For version 3 or higher, the header length is at least 104 bytes, 
including the next fields through header_length.

I'd also add a sentence that this field must be a multiple of 8.

Maybe:

if software doesn't know how to interpret the field, it may be safely 
ignored unless a corresponding incompatible feature flag bit is set; 
however, the field should be preserved unchanged when rewriting the 
image header.

Maybe:

Each optional field that does not have a corresponding incompatible 
feature bit must support the value 0 that gives the same default 
behavior as when the optional field is omitted.

Do we even still need this if we require 8-byte alignment?  We'd never 
be able to cut a single field in the middle, but I suppose you are 
worried about cutting a 2-field 16-byte addition tied to a single 
feature in the middle.  But that's not going to happen in practice.  The 
only time the header will be longer than 104 bytes is if at least one 
documented optional feature has been implemented/backported, and that 
feature will be implemented in its entirety.  If you backport a later 
feature but not the earlier, you're still going to set header_length to 
the boundary of the feature that you ARE backporting.  Thus, I argue 
that blindly setting header_length to 120 prior to the standard ever 
defining optional field(s) at 112-120 is premature, and that if we ever 
add a feature requiring bytes 112-128 for a new feature, you will never 
see a valid qcow2 file with a header length of 120.
