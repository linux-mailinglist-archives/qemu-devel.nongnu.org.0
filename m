I'm completely in agreement that a lot of the jobs will be suitable to
be run on containers, but like you exemplified here Erik, we must take
into account the ones that won't be suitable.

For instance, a very real use case is testing KVM on bare metal.  One
could argue that "QEMU running on a container making use of
KVM would suffice". It may be true, it may not.  But even that=20
won't be possible Today on a CentOS/RHEL 8 machine, because
gitlab-runner knows nothing about podman, so full blown x86
physical boxes may be the "cheaper" and more practical solution, at
least initially. Trying to use other architectures would surely have
similar issues.

This is great, and it aligns with my previous point that reproducibility
it's not *just* about the hardware, but about diligently documenting
and automating the environments, be them mundane or super specialized.
And IMO that should score some points when it comes to being
promoted/demoted as a Gating machine/job.

Thanks for the feedback Erik!
