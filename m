That makes sense. However, while users of real machines agree to update
their firmware after determining what will change, or at least expect
there could be a change that they'll need to adapt to, users of virtual
machines simply reboot, getting new firmware and ACPI tables, and then
possibly new surprises. Indeed, they may have opted to use a virtual
machine precisely so they could keep the environment stable across
updates of the real machine. IOW, since we can maintain a versioned
machine, then maybe we should?

I don't see how we can be sure that we won't break anything. Although,
in this case, we *probably* won't.

I agree with all of that.

So it sounds to me like we have some flexibility in our versioned machine
maintenance. We can choose to forgo the usual compat code when the risk is
deemed low enough. And, if somebody screams, we can always fix it later.
I can live with that. I'll go ahead and respin without the versioning.
