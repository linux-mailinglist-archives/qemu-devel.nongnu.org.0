I'd like to avoid that, and refer only to the canonical names.

Could you explain the use case you have in mind, so we can look
for alternatives?

I guess it depends on your goal:

If your just want to know if one specific feature is missing for
some reason, you can check the QOM properties directly.  That's
OK, and it's even better than checking the `feature-words`
property.

If you want to be 100% sure no property was missing when starting
the VM (e.g. emulate the behavior of the "enforce" option), I
suggest you check if `unavailable-features` is empty.
