not that I know of (at least not with device_add/del)

in theory it should be
 instance_init -> set properties -> realize
and ping pong realize <-> unrealize, should work as far the device
in question takes that in consideration.

In practice for generic arbitrary device it probably won't work
out of the box since people tended to put too much in realize
and didn't care about proper cleanup since device in question
typically is destroyed right after unrealize.

So it's probably implementable for some internal device
if it doesn't use device_add/del, otherwise millage might vary.
