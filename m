Hi,

It seems to me that there is a bug in Linux=E2=80=99s XFS kernel driver, as
I=E2=80=99ve explained here:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-10/msg01429.html

In combination with our commit c8bb23cbdbe32f, this may lead to guest
data corruption when using qcow2 images on XFS with aio=3Dnative.

We can=E2=80=99t wait until the XFS kernel driver is fixed, we should work
around the problem ourselves.

This is an RFC for two reasons:
(1) I don=E2=80=99t know whether this is the right way to address the issue=
,
(2) Ideally, we should detect whether the XFS kernel driver is fixed and
    if so stop applying the workaround.
    I don=E2=80=99t know how we would go about this, so this series doesn=
=E2=80=99t do
    it.  (Hence it=E2=80=99s an RFC.)
(3) Perhaps it=E2=80=99s a bit of a layering violation to let the file-posi=
x
    driver access and modify a BdrvTrackedRequest object.

As for how we can address the issue, I see three ways:
(1) The one presented in this series: On XFS with aio=3Dnative, we extend
    tracked requests for post-EOF fallocate() calls (i.e., write-zero
    operations) to reach until infinity (INT64_MAX in practice), mark
    them serializing and wait for other conflicting requests.

    Advantages:
    + Limits the impact to very specific cases
      (And that means it wouldn=E2=80=99t hurt too much to keep this workar=
ound
      even when the XFS driver has been fixed)
    + Works around the bug where it happens, namely in file-posix

    Disadvantages:
    - A bit complex
    - A bit of a layering violation (should file-posix have access to
      tracked requests?)

(2) Always skip qcow2=E2=80=99s handle_alloc_space() on XFS.  The XFS bug o=
nly
    becomes visible due to that function: I don=E2=80=99t think qcow2 write=
s
    zeroes in any other I/O path, and raw images are fixed in size so
    post-EOF writes won=E2=80=99t happen.

    Advantages:
    + Maybe simpler, depending on how difficult it is to handle the
      layering violation
    + Also fixes the performance problem of handle_alloc_space() being
      slow on ppc64+XFS.

    Disadvantages:
    - Huge layering violation because qcow2 would need to know whether
      the image is stored on XFS or not.
    - We=E2=80=99d definitely want to skip this workaround when the XFS dri=
ver
      has been fixed, so we need some method to find out whether it has

(3) Drop handle_alloc_space(), i.e. revert c8bb23cbdbe32f.
    To my knowledge I=E2=80=99m the only one who has provided any benchmark=
s for
    this commit, and even then I was a bit skeptical because it performs
    well in some cases and bad in others.  I concluded that it=E2=80=99s
    probably worth it because the =E2=80=9Csome cases=E2=80=9D are more lik=
ely to occur.

    Now we have this problem of corruption here (granted due to a bug in
    the XFS driver), and another report of massively degraded
    performance on ppc64
    (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1745823 =E2=80=93 sorry,=
 a
    private BZ; I hate that :-/  The report is about 40 % worse
    performance for an in-guest fio write benchmark.)

    So I have to ask the question about what the justification for
    keeping c8bb23cbdbe32f is.  How much does performance increase with
    it actually?  (On non-(ppc64+XFS) machines, obviously)

    Advantages:
    + Trivial
    + No layering violations
    + We wouldn=E2=80=99t need to keep track of whether the kernel bug has =
been
      fixed or not
    + Fixes the ppc64+XFS performance problem

    Disadvantages:
    - Reverts cluster allocation performance to pre-c8bb23cbdbe32f
      levels, whatever that means

So this is the main reason this is an RFC: What should we do?  Is (1)
really the best choice?


In any case, I=E2=80=99ve ran the test case I showed in
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-10/msg01282.html
more than ten times with this series applied and the installation
succeeded every time.  (Without this series, it fails like every other
time.)
