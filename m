I'm having a little bit of a hard time parsing the overall behaviour
from the above description. Let me outline the examples so you can
confirm if I've got it right.

Lets assume there is a VM configured using "Haswell"

Today a mgmt app would pass the CPU model name in to QEMU as is,
and thus we get

  $QEMU -machine pc-i440fx-4.0 -cpu Haswell ...more args...

The semantics of "Haswell" here is going to vary according to
what the machine type pc-i440fx-4.0 customizes wrt Haswell.

If the config later has the machine type changed to pc-i440fx-4.1
the semantics of Haswell might change in an arbitrary way. It
might even become unrunnable on the current hardware.

With the new versioned machine types, the VM config of "Haswell"
would be resolved into some arbitrary versioned machine type
"Haswell-NNN" and thus the mgmt app would launch

  $QEMU -machine pc-i440fx-4.0 -cpu Haswell-NNN ...more args...

The semantics of "Haswell-NNN" will never change no matter what
the machine type does.

The end user has the option to explicitly give "Haswell-NNN" to
the mgmt app if they know they want that particular variant, and
in this case the mgmt app won't need to resolve anything (or at
least the process of trying to resolve it won't change it).
