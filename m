I'm skeptical.

For the management application to assist its users, it has to translate
both the deprecated QEMU interface and its replacement into its own
interfaces (because those are the ones the users actually use).
Management applications routinely translate in the other direction.  I
doubt anyone would build reverse translation capabilities just for
helping users update deprecated configurations.  So unless such
capabilities get built for other purposes, machine-friendliness will
remain unused.

If the management application's user is another machine, another
translation is needed.  And so forth until we reach the guy who's
supposed to update configuration.

Such a game of telephone is unlikely to produce anything but confusion,
except for specific cases we test across the whole stack.
