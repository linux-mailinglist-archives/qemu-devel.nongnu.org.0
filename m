You're right, the compatibility causes wrong behavior for the default
-rtc settings (the RC pauses across migration).  The right thing to do
would be to store the base rather than the offset: that is, you store
the time at which LR was written.  Then the offset is s->lr - s->base
and it's independent of the machine on which the rtc_clock is being read.

By the way, the data sheet says "the counter and match values are
compared in a comparator. When both values are equal, the RTCINTR
interrupt is asserted HIGH"; QEMU compares the RTC value (read from
RTC_DR) and not the counter value, but Linux code seems to expect QEMU's
behavior.
