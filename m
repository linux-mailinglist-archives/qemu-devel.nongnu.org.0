See https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg674110.html
for an explanation.

But as I explained in that other message, the main difference between
QOM and something like GObject is eactly the QAPI integration, and that
is where CLI and RPC enter the game: for example the possibility to
share code between -object and HMP object_add on one side and QMP
object-add on the other side.

Even code riddled by backwards-compatibility special cases, such as
-accel and -machine, can share code between themselves and -object to
some extent; this is thanks to functions such as object_property_parse,
whose parsing is deferred to visitors and hence to QAPI.

The main thing we get from it is that the QOM paths treat children and
links the same, and links are properties.  To be honest it's not a
feature that is very much developed, so perhaps we can remove it but we
need to evaluate the impact of losing it.
