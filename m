I think this is a rather odd feature for this device to support. The
implementation is slow can end up allocating quite a bit of memory. If
we were going to support it here, wouldn't it make more sense to tie it
to the filesystem's ability to support fallocate hole punch for the
backing namespace, and check if the range is allocated with SEEK_HOLE?
Then you don't even need to track persistent state, and we're actually
getting the genuine capability.
