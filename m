The general idea of the amend interface is more that you describe a
desired state rather than operations to achieve it.

This distinction feels artificial to me. All three operations just
change the content of a keyslot. Whether it contained a key or not in
the old state shouldn't make a difference for how to get a new value
(which could be a new key or just an empty keyslot) written to it.

Making an omitted key mean something different from the other options so
that it's not just defaulting to one of them is problematic, too. We
have at least one place where it works like this (backing files) and it
tends to give us headaches.
