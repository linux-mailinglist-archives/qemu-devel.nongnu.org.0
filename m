I also want to *emphasise* that not being able to provide all the keyslots
is the smaller problem here, since it is relatively easy to omit slots that
should be left untouched.
The bigger problem is supporting the 'erase all keyslots that match the pas=
sword'
That doesn't fit into current amend definition at all.
