I have no interest in the NVMe device emulation, but one of the first
thing I notice when I look at the wiki the time I wanted to send my
first patch, is the "Return the favor" paragraph:
https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch#Return_the_favor

 "Peer review only works if everyone chips in a bit of review time.
  If everyone submitted more patches than they reviewed, we would
  have a patch backlog. A good goal is to try to review at least as
  many patches from others as what you submit. Don't worry if you
  don't know the code base as well as a maintainer; it's perfectly
  fine to admit when your review is weak because you are unfamiliar
  with the code."

So as some reviewed my patches, I try to return the favor to the
community, in particular when I see someone is stuck waiting for
review, and the patch topic is some area I can understand.

I don't see that as an "out of pity" reaction.

Note, it is true bomb series scares reviewers. You learned it the
bad way. But you can see, after resending the first part of your
"bomb", even if it took 10 versions, the result is a great
improvement!

Sounds good to me, but it is up to Keith Busch to accept.

It would be nice to have at least one developer from WDC listed as
designated reviewer too.

Maxim is candidate for designated reviewer but I think he doesn't
have the time.

It would also nice to have Andrzej Jakowski listed, if he is interested.
