Title:
  K800 keyboard no longer works when attached to a VM

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I use Logitech K800 keyboard which is connected to a PC through
  Logitech unifying receiver. In order to control my windows VM i attach
  unifying receiver USB device to a VM using "virsh attach-device VM-
  Name ./device.xml". Device ID as seen in lsusb is 046d:c52b.

  As of v4.1.0 keyboard no longer works when attached to a windows VM.
  When attached receiver is still at least partially functional.
  Logitech pairing utility properly displays paired keyboard, pressing
  buttons on the keyboard shows changing indicator icon in pairing
  utility. Pairing and unpairing works. Pressing keys however fails to
  register any key presses.

  Downgrading to v4.0.0 fixes the issue.

  device.xml used to attach USB device:
  ```
  <hostdev mode=3D'subsystem' type=3D'usb'>
          <source>
                  <vendor id=3D'0x046d'/>
                  <product id=3D'0xc52b'/>
          </source>
  </hostdev>

  ```
