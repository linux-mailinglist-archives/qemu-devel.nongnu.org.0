Or use an existing NBD server over a Unix socket paired to a WebSocket 
proxy that forwards all traffic from the Unix socket over a WebSocket. 
That may be easier than writing the NBD server itself in Javascript.

qemu already knows how to connect as a client to websockets; Dan 
Berrange knows more about that setup.  I suspect it would not be too 
difficult to teach the qemu NBD client code to use a WebSocket instead 
of a Unix or TCP socket as its data source.
