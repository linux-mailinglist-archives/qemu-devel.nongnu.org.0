I'd be very wary of having a "null" vs "empty dict" distinction to
mean "erase" vs "don't touch".

It feels like that is designed to maximise the chances of someone
shooting themselves in the foot by accidentally using "null" instead
of an "empty dict".

The reason for the use of "active=3Dyes" / "active=3Dno" is because that
was reasonable explicit about wanting to erase a keyslot, and it does
does actually map to the key slot on disk which has an "active" field
taking two magic values.

I don't think I understand what you mean here. If you don't have a
password the only change you can make is to erase key slots.

BTW, looking forward to the future, if we ever implement LUKS version 2
support there are a bunch more things can be tweaked at runtime. Most
notable is that it is possible to change the master key, and change the
encryption algorithm choices. Both of these then need to trigger a bulk
re-encrypt of the entire disk contents, which takes a long time.

I doubt we'll do this in the near term, but we should consider how this
might fit into whatever scheme we pick for updates.

Daniel
