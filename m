Hi!

This is a patch series that is a result of my discussion with Paulo on
how to correctly fix the root cause of the BZ #1812399.

The root cause of this bug is the fact that IO thread is running mostly
unlocked versus main thread on which device hotplug is done.

qdev_device_add first creates the device object, then places it on the bus,
and only then realizes it.

However some drivers and currently only virtio-scsi enumerate its child bus
devices on each request that is received from the guest and that can happen=
 on the IO
thread.

Thus we have a window when new device is on the bus but not realized and ca=
n be accessed
by the virtio-scsi driver in that state.

Fix that by doing two things:

1. Add partial RCU protection to the list of a bus's child devices.
This allows the scsi IO thread to safely enumerate the child devices
while it races with the hotplug placing the device on the bus.

2. Make the virtio-scsi driver check .realized property of the scsi device
and avoid touching the device if it isn't

I don't think that this is very pretty way to solve this, we discussed this
with Paulo and it kind of looks like the lesser evil. I am open to your tho=
ughts about this.

Note that this patch series doesn't pass some unit tests and in particular =
qtest 'drive_del-test'
I did some light debug of this test and I see that the reason for this is t=
hat now child device deletion
can be delayed due to RCU. This is also something I would like to discuss i=
n this RFC.

Note also that I might have some code style errors and bugs in this since I=
 haven't
tested the code in depth yet, because I am not yet sure that this is the ri=
ght way
to fix that bug

Also note that in the particular bug report the issue wasn't a race but rat=
her due
to combination of things, the .realize code in the middle managed to trigge=
r IO on the virtqueue
which caused the virtio-scsi driver to access the half realized device. How=
ever
since this can happen as well with real IO thread, this patch series was do=
ne,
which fixes this as well.

Best regards,
