It's not so much intellectual property (since that term is at odds with 
open source), but authorship rights.

Looking at git history, the file has been touched by:

Kevin Wolf
Stefan Hajnoczi (while at IBM)
Eduardo Habkost
Max Reitz
Philippe Mathieu-DaudÃ©
Paolo Bonzini

where Stefan was the only contributor without a redhat.com address at 
the time.  So if anything, a Red Hat copyright is most likely; but you 
are also correct that it is incorrect to add a copyright line on someone 
else's behalf without their permission.

I've cc'd all prior authors; if Kevin agrees, and unless anyone speaks 
up to the contrary, I'm willing to add:

# Copyright (C) 2012 Red Hat, Inc.

for Kevin's initial contribution, without worrying about subsequent 
contributions.

Adding a copyright line could be a followup patch, so in the meantime, 
making what was previously an implicit license now explicit is fine even 
if it is odd to assert GPL without also asserting Copyright.
