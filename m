Hi John, This issue can only be reproduced on Windows 10. I've observed a=
nd compared the behavior of Windows 10 and Windows 7. It seems Windows 7 =
wouldn't disable the PCI=5FCOMMAND=5FMASTER flag when disabling ahci devi=
ces. That's why this issue won't happen on Win7. Here's the trace log on =
both guest OS, on disabling and re-engaging SATA disk: Windows 10, disabl=
