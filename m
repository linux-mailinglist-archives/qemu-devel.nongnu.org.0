Right but it looks to me the issue is not the alignment.

Is this a bug? I remember that at least for vtd, it won't do any DMAR on 
the intrrupt address range

Another possible (theoretical) issue (for vhost) is that it can't 
trigger interrupt through the interrupt range.

I think this go back to one of our previous discussion of whether to 
introduce a dedicated notifiers for device IOTLB.

For IOMMU, it might have limitation like GAW, but for device IOTLB it 
probably doesn't. That's the reason we hit the assert here.

Ok, so it looks like we need a dedicated notifiers to device IOTLB.
