The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  qemu-system-arm: ../hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion
  `addr <=3D GINTSTS2' failed.

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When trying to run the 2016-05-27 Raspbian image on the emulated
  raspi2 platform, the system boots but shortly after the login prompt
  QEMU (master; commit ID ca489cd037e4d50dc6c40570a167504ad7e5a521) dies
  with:

  qemu-system-arm: ../hw/usb/hcd-dwc2.c:666: dwc2_glbreg_read: Assertion
  `addr <=3D GINTSTS2' failed.

  Steps to reproduce:

  1. Get the image: wget
  http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2016-05-31/2016=
-05-27
  -raspbian-jessie.zip

  2. Extract the kernel image and DTB:

  sudo losetup -f --show -P 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img
  sudo mkdir /mnt/rpi
  sudo mount /dev/loop11p1 /mnt/rpi/
  cp /mnt/rpi/kernel7.img .                                                =
                                                                           =
                                                                           =
                                                                   =

  cp /mnt/rpi/bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb .                                        =
                                                                           =
                                                                           =
                                                                   =

  sudo umount /mnt/rpi =

  sudo losetup -d /dev/loop11 =


  3. Run QEMU:
  qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -m 1G -dtb bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -kernel kernel7.=
img -append "rw earlyprintk loglevel=3D8 console=3DttyAMA0,115200 dwc_otg.l=
pm_enable=3D0 root=3D/dev/mmcblk0p2" -sd 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img -sm=
p 4 -serial stdio -display none

  A few seconds after the login prompt is displayed, QEMU will exit with
  the assertion failure.

  I also tried changing all of the asserts to if statements that (for
  MMIO reads) returned 0 and (for writes) just returned, but this
  resulted in a non-responsive system.
