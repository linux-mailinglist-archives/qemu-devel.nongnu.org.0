KVM_CAP_X86_SMM is currently checked as a KVM-wide capability.  One option
is to change that to use a per-VM ioctl() and then have KVM return 0 for
SEV-ES VMs.

Yeah, we more or less came to the same conclusion for TDX.  It's easy enough
to throw an error if QEMU attempts to read protected state, but without
other invasive changes, it's too easy to unintentionally kill the VM.  MSRs
are a bit of a special case, but for REGS, SREGS, and whatever other state
is read out, simply letting KVM return zeros/garbage seems like the lesser
of all evils.
