I can reproduce this issue with a very *low* probability so I failed
to investigate it :-(.  (It might because the LPI was delivered to a
busy vcpu...)

You can leave it as it is until someone else complain about it again.
Or take the similar approach as check_acked() - wait up to 5s for the
interrupt to be delivered, and bail out as soon as we see it.


Thanks,
Zenghui
