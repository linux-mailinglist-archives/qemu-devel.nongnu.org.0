I never saw this unaligned size in my testing. In this case if you can 
provide vfio_* event traces, that will helpful.

In which function in QEMU do you have to add this?

If vendor driver doesn't want to send data but still has data in staging 
buffer, vendor driver still can control to send pending_bytes for this 
iteration as 0 as this is a trap field.

I would defer this to Alex.

I saw these errors, I'm looking into it.
