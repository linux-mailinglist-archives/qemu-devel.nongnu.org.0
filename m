Hi Guys - I'm currently trying to use IPv6 with QEMU on ARM / AARCH64 Model=
s (Sabre-Lite / Zync SOCs) and I see this problem. The system gets an IPv6 =
address from the QEMU in-built router which can be used to ping the default=
 gateway (the dhcp router itself). All this is good but not really useful a=
s I want to communicate with a TCP6 client on the host (Windows / Linux) ma=
chine running on port 8080. I've added the co-responding port mappings (lik=
e I do with IPv4) but I never receive packets from the host OS which is thi=
s issue. So I have the following questions, =

- It seems that this issue is still open and on the wishlist. Is this corre=
ct ? If so, is there any ETA to when someone will take this up ? If none, m=
ay be I can look at this ;-).. I'm currently using QEMU 3.0
- Assuming that its not working, what are the alternatives that I can use ?=
 I understand that there is TAP-TUN Networking where the QEMU model can com=
municate with the hardware interface over a bridge.. This should work with =
IPv6.. Can you confirm ?

This needs quick closure on my side and so quick comments will be
appreciated..

Thanks, =

Bilal

Title:
  Usermode networking hostfwd only listens on IPv4

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When forwarding ports in usermode networking (-net user,hostfwd=3D),
  QEMU binds to IPv4 only. Therefore, connecting to the port over IPv6
  results in 'connection refused'.

  I experienced this in QEMU 2.10.1, but it looks to still be present in
  the current master (861cd431c99e56ddb5953ca1da164a9c32b477ca), since
  slirp_hostfwd in net/slirp.c uses in_addr instead of in6_addr.
