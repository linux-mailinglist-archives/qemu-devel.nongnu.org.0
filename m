Title:
  tcg-target.inc.c:3495:no such instruction: `xgetbv'

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  While building QEMU on Mac OS 10.6.8 I saw this error message:
  tag-target.inc.c:3495:no such instruction: `xgetbv'
  In the file tcg/i386/tcg-target.inc.c at line 3495 is where the issue is =
located. This is the problem code:
  asm ("xgetbv" : "=3Da" (xcrl), "=3Dd" (xcrh) : "c" (0));

  https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit/issues/78
  According to the above link, another project also experienced this proble=
m on Mac OS X. The fix was to replace the name of the instruction with the =
encoded form '.byte 0x0F, 0x01, 0xd0'. =


  Host info:
  Mac OS 10.6.8
  GCC 5.2.0

  Additional information:
  This may be a gcc issue. I have compiled QEMU on Mac OS 10.12 and didn't =
experience any issues. The compiler used was Apple's clang.
