so this is from 
 'if (cpu->apic_id == UNASSIGNED_APIC_ID) {'
branch, meaning cpu comes from -device/device_add

which means that user hasn't provided 'node-id',
in which case we should error out asking for specifying NUMA node-id along with other options

(1)
However that's not enough since by contract query-hotpluggbale-cpus shall provide all attributes
necessary to hotplug CPU, which makes node-id is not an optional in case of EPYC cpu.
So we need to initialize ms->possible_cpus->cpus[i].props.[has_]node_id by the time
we start creating CPUs.

here are 2 variants:
(2)
  * single node:
      nodes_per_pkg 1 and ms->smp.sockets == 1

    since it's the only node and mapping of RAM/CPU is unambigiuos,
    we can deal with it by moving auto_enable_numa into MachineState
    and enabling it in case EPYC CPU is used

  * multiple nodes:
      - ms->smp.sockets > 1
      - nodes_per_pkg > 1
    we can't make up NUMA nodes automatically, and have to ask user to use -numa options
    to provide nodes along with CPU/RAM mapping. So in case NUMA wasn't configured
    explicitly, we can only error out. (that also applies to CPU created implicitly by board '-smp X')

(3) Once user supplied mapping we need to checks that it matches EPYC topology,


(4) As for CPUID, current code in CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX
      if (nodes <= 4) { /* here nodes is nodes_per_pkg */
         / goes by stricly spec /
         *ecx = ((nodes - 1) << 8) | (topo_ids.pkg_id << 2) | topo_ids.node_id;
         /* makes up system wide NUMA node IDs which happen to match system wide
            NUMA node IDs created by -numa, when -smp + -numa produces nodes_per_pkg is in that range,
            basically user has no idea when this happens
          */
      } else {
         /* makeup new algorithm system wide NUMA node IDs generation for out of spec behaviour */
      }
     
    problem with both branches is that might lead to inconsistentcy between system wide
    NUMA node id in CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX and the one configured with -numa which goes to
    SRAT ACPI table and should go to CPU::node-id property.

    Considering that out of spec behaviour is allowed we probably schould replace both branches
    with
       *ecx = ((nodes - 1) << 8) | cpu->node_id;
    which ensures consistency of system wide NUMA node ids and add checks for max nodes/max node id.

checks could be done early in cpu's realize() function.
