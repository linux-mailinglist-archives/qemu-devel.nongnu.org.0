Okay, if we consider the existing qcow2 case as the only case, writes
are what matters. Then we can ignore backing files. (However, it
shouldn't check bs->file, but s->data_file, I think.)

Fair enough, but let's improve the documentation (both QAPI schema and
comments in the code) to be explicit about these details, how the result
is determined for nodes with multiple children, and what it means and
doesn't mean therefore.
