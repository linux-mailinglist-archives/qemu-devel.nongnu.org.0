hi Alex

yes, with the same mdev_type, user still has to enumerate all parent
devices and test between the supported mdev_types to know whether two mdev
devices are compatible.
maybe this is not a problem? in reality, it is the administrator that
specifies two devices and the management tool feedbacks compatibility
result. management tool is not required to pre-test and setup the
compatibility map beforehand.

If so, then the only problem left is namespace collision. 
given that the migration_version nodes is exported by vendor driver,
maybe it can also embed its module name in the migration version string,
like "i915" in "i915-GVTg_V5_8", as you suggested above.

with module name as the first mandatory field in version string and
skipping the enumeration/testing problem, we can happyly unify migration
across mdev and phys devices. e.g. it is possible to migrate between
VFs in sriov and mdevs in siov to achieve backwards compatibility.

Thanks
Yan
