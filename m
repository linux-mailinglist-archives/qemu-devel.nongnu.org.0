I totally agree.  This would not be a short term workaround, I expect it
to stay for years; I don't expect the transition of the configure script
to Meson to be very short.

This can be both a pro and a con.  On one hand it means this is "more
magic" that is here to stay.  On the other hand it makes transition
patches smaller and easier to review.

I agree that in principle all scripting should be Python.  On the other
hand Perl is quite suitable for "configure tasks that are too
complicated for shell" and are not going to be rewritten in Meson down
the road.  And I say that as someone who has written exactly 3 serious
Perl programs in his life, two of which are part of QEMU. :)

In this case shell scripting could also be a plausible alternative; I
didn't try only because I first tried the obvious choice of Python.

Or we can just decide that an incomplete help below a "please use
--python" error is good enough.

Yes, though it's quite some duplication: right now an option needs

- a default in configure

- command line parsing in configure

- a Meson -D argument in configure

- an help message in configure

- a declaration (including default and help) in meson_options.txt

so this patch reduces an option from 8-9 lines to 2.

There are a couple secondary goals too.  First, making sure all the
policy is in meson_options.txt and not configure; this avoids surprises
when/if we can start invoking meson directly.  Second, removing
variables completely from the configure script gives a better idea of
interdependencies between the configure tests.

Thanks,

Paolo
