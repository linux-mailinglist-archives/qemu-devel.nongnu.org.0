Yes, that's the goal.  The above lists the ideas we had on how to get
closer to the goal.

You're asking for command line QAPIfication.

I figure they work as well as anything when a human runs QEMU directly.

They're ineffective when a management application runs QEMU.  It won't
be able to make sense of deprecation messages it doesn't already know
(and therefore doesn't actually need), so all it can do is bury them in
logs nobody reads until after things have gone south.

Exposing deprecation in introspection is just one idea of several.  It
might be the least immediately useful one.  We'll likely want to
do more.
