The datasheet only talks about the number of word times that is set
with the UCON register. It doesn't say what the hardware does
if the word time (baud rate) is changed while data is in the receive
queue. But then data in the receive queue suggests that the remote
end is actively transmitting, and changing the baud rate in that
situation would result in a mess. With that in mind, I don't think
we need to be concerned about an inaccurate word time for a few
milliseconds after a baud-rate change.

I agree that changing the UCON value might not have an impact
on data already in the queue. I'll drop that call - I would guess
that HW doesn't bother recalculating anything when UCON is set
(changed or not), and it doesn't really matter, so why bother
with the extra code.

Correct, and that was the idea. The rest is just a lack of
understanding, so I'll drop VMSTATE_TIMER_PTR.

Thanks,
