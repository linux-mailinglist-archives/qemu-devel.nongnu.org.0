Shorten a bit the description of what libvirt-ci does, the name of the
data files is not relevant at that point.  However, the procedures to add
new build prerequisites are lacking some information, particularly with
respect to regenerating the output test files for lcitool's unit tests.
While at it, also update the paths in the libvirt-ci repository.
