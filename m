Note that the RCU thread is expected to sit most of the time doing 
nothing, so I don't think this matters.

Zhengui's theory that notify_me doesn't work properly on ARM is more
promising, but he couldn't provide a clear explanation of why he thought
notify_me is involved.  In particular, I would have expected notify_me to
be wrong if the qemu_poll_ns call came from aio_ctx_dispatch, for example:


    glib_pollfds_fill
      g_main_context_prepare
        aio_ctx_prepare
          atomic_or(&ctx->notify_me, 1)
    qemu_poll_ns
    glib_pollfds_poll
      g_main_context_check
        aio_ctx_check
          atomic_and(&ctx->notify_me, ~1)
      g_main_context_dispatch
        aio_ctx_dispatch
          /* do something for event */
            qemu_poll_ns 

but all backtraces show thread 1 in os_host_main_loop_wait:

Can you place somewhere your util/async.o object file for me to look at it?

Anyway:

This is UINT_MAX, not INT_MAX.  qemu_futex_wait() doesn't care of the 
signedness of the value, which is why it is declared as void *.  (That said,
changing "ev" to "&ev->value" would be nicer indeed).

You could change it to 3, but it has to have all the bits in EV_FREE 
(see atomic_or(&ev->value, EV_FREE) in qemu_event_reset).

You could also change it to -1u, but I don't see a particular need to do so.

If you changed it to 2, it's wrong.

Why would it need to do so?
