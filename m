When first wording the lifetimes, I tried to strike a balance between
limiting what we have to support, while also not negatively impacting
a large number of QEMU developers or users. Since we had never had
such support lifetimes declared for QEMU before, I was fairly generous,
hence picking the 2 year overlap for LTS distros (Ubuntu, RHEL and
SLES).

It is easier to come to a decision when considering a real world tech
problem related to the lifetime.=20

The start of this thread was debating Debian / Python support. If we
fix the doc to put debian under the short life distro category, we'll
have solved the Python problem IIUC.

Then I'd suggest we just leave LTS distros as a 2 year overlap until
we hit some technical problem that is caused by needing the 2 year
overlap. That way we can consider the cost/benefit in more real terms.

Daniel
