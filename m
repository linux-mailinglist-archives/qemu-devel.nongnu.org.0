Is this the sort of thing we should emit warnings for? I guess this is a
philosophical question as QEMU tends to err towards being taciturn on
the command line unless something is actually wrong (and not just
stupid).

I wouldn't expect a warning for -serial mon:stdio but maybe a
non-localhost tcp chardev for o+rw socket might be worth a mention? Of
course this sort of sanitising of the command line options does incur
cost and complexity in our option processing.

However extra clarity is always welcome, modulo typos and grammar
suggestions the others have made:
