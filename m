Yes, it's because failed requests can be live-migrated and retried on
the destination host. In other words, live migration still works even
when there are failed requests.

There may be things that can be refactored so there is less duplication
in devices, but the basic design goal is that the block layer doesn't
keep track of failed requests because they are live migrated together
with the device state.

Maybe Kevin Wolf has more thoughts to share about rerror=3D/werror=3D.
