That works, too.  I chose to parse \\ to keep the language a
sub-language of JSON's (and Python's) at the lexical level: we reject
some valid JSON (and Python) such as 'a\b'.  Not treating \ special at
all would accept it, but with a different meaning.  Will be rejected at
a higher level, so it doesn't really matter.  But the reasoning involves
more than just the lexical level then.

funny-char.json checks ';'.  '\' is no different.
