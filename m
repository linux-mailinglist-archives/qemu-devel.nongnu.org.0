It depends on if we have other block drivers that have IO segment/max transfer sizes,
that we need to enforce, other than the SG_IO case.

Knowing that the commit that added these limits to file-posix, which I was fixing is relatively
new, I guess there are other cases for these limits.

I'll check this tomorrow.

Implementation wise, I think I can do this, but I'll wait few days for the
feedback on my proposal.

Thanks for finding this bug!
