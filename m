There where some broken links so fix those up with proper references
to the devel docs. I also did a little light copy-editing to reflect
the current state and broke up a paragraph to reduce the "wall of
text" effect.

 Test your patches
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-Although QEMU has `continuous integration
-services <Testing#Continuous_Integration>`__ that attempt to test
-patches submitted to the list, it still saves everyone time if you have
-already tested that your patch compiles and works. Because QEMU is such
-a large project, it's okay to use configure arguments to limit what is
-built for faster turnaround during your development time; but it is
-still wise to also check that your patches work with a full build before
-submitting a series, especially if your changes might have an unintended
-effect on other areas of the code you don't normally experiment with.
-See `Testing <Testing>`__ for more details on what tests are available.
-Also, it is a wise idea to include a testsuite addition as part of your
-patches - either to ensure that future changes won't regress your new
-feature, or to add a test which exposes the bug that the rest of your
-series fixes. Keeping separate commits for the test and the fix allows
-reviewers to rebase the test to occur first to prove it catches the
-problem, then again to place it last in the series so that bisection
-doesn't land on a known-broken state.
