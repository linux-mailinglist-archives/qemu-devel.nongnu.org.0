Where do you see this assumption in guest code? I don't think this is true.
Guest code seems to handle this by making sure to only step the time 
forward.
Read carefully services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c and point me to what 
I'm missing if you think otherwise (i.e. I missed something).

Ok. Will try to phrase something for v4.

Ok. Will add this to v4.

I agree. :) That's why there is a default value.

Ok. Will add to v4.
