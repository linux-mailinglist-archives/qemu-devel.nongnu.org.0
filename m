This isn't what I'd describe / consider as unprivileged, as AFAICT
although QEMU can use it unprivileged, this still requires a privileged
management process to do the setup in sysfs.

I think it is desirable to be able support a fully unprivileged
model where there is nothing requiring elevated privileges, neither
libvirtd or QEMU.

I think this basically ends up at the same requirement as support
for non-Linux hosts. We have to assume that some desirable deployment
scenarios will not be able to use Linux kernel features, either because
they lack privileges, or are simply non-Linux hosts.

A UNIX socket, or localhost TCP socket, sounds most appealing from a
a portability POV.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but wouldn't a CUSE interface
still have issues with something needing to be privileged to
do the initial setup, and also still lack OS portability.
