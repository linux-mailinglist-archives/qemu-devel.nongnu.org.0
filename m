Ok, so let's try to add some more useful test to the "auto" group. Kevin
mentioned 030, 040 and 041, and I think it should be ok to enable them
(IIRC the only issue was that they run a little bit longer, but if they
are very useful, we should include them anyway).

Do you have any other tests in mind which could be very useful?

While that sounds noble at a first glance, I think you've maybe got too
high expectations at yourself here? I mean, all other maintainers of
other subsystems with tests have the same "problem" if the tests for
their subsystem run in "make check". The "normal" behavior that I've
seen so far (and which I think is the right way to deal with it):

1) If a pull request gets rejected due to a "make check" failure, simply
drop the offending patches from the pull request, send a v2 pull req
without them, and tell the author of the offending patches to fix the
problem (unless the fix is completely trivial and could immediately be
applied to the v2 pull req). You really don't have to fix each and every
issue on your own as a maintainer and can redirect this to the patch
authors again.

2) If a test fails occasionally during "make check" (due to race
conditions or whatever), it gets disabled from "make check" if it can't
be fixed easily (e.g. in the qtests it gets moved to the "SPEED=3Dslow"
category, or in iotests it would get removed from the "auto" group).

Well, I guess we won't ever get there if we don't try. And the hurdles
will rather get higher over the years since more and more tests are
added ...

I think that "I have to investigate now ..." mindset is not the right
way to handle these kind of issues. If a test is shaky and can not be
fixed easily, we should simply disable it from the "auto" group again.
So if you like, I can send a patch to remove 130 from the "auto" group
(personally, I'd rather wait to see if it fails anytime soon again, or
if this was maybe rather a one-time issue due to a non-clean test system
=2E..)
