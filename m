This is the bare minimum that you need to establish a full-duplex async
message-based protocol with Python's asyncio.

The features to be added in forthcoming commits are:

- Runstate tracking
- Logging
- Support for incoming connections via accept()
- _cb_outbound, _cb_inbound message hooks
- _readline() method
