Actually, there could be a conclusion: The declaration shouldn't be in
include/block/export.h, but in include/block/nbd.h. We already include
both headers in block/export/export.c because of qmp_nbd_*().

Of course, you already requests that I leave the other NBD-related stuff
in blockdev-nbd.c rather than moving it there, so the use of blk_exp_nbd
would be the only reason that remains for export.c to include nbd.h.

But it might still be better than having it in export.h.
