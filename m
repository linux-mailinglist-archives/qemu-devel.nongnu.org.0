I tend to agree with Alex here, and additionally want to expand more on
this topic.

In my view: (that I think is at least very close to the community consensus=
)

This is *not* a ppc-specific issue. There exist a principle across all
targets
that QEMU FPU calculation must be accurate - exactly as specified in any
applicable particular ISA document. Any discrepancy is an outright bug.

We even recently had several patches for FPU in ppc target that handled
some fairly obscure cases of inaccuracies, I believe they were authored
by Paul Clarke, so there are people in ppc community that care about
FPU accuracy (as I guess is the case for any target).

There shouldn't be a target that decides by itself and within itself
"ok, we don't need accuracy, let's trade it for speed". This violates
the architecture of QEMU. Please allow that for any given software
project, there is an architecture that should be respected.

This doesn't mean that anybody's experimentation is discouraged. No-one
can stop anybody from forking from QEMU upstream tree and do whatever
is wanted.

But, this doesn't mean such experimentation will be upstreamed. QEMU
upstream should be collecting place for the best ideas and implementations,
not for arbitrary experimentations.

Best regards,
Aleksandar
