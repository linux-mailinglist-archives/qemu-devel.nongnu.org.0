I totally missed that commit.  My bad.

Actually, now that I think about it SVM *will* have some state while
running in guest mode, namely:

- the NPT page table root

- the L1 CR4.PAE, EFER.LMA and EFER.NXE bits, which determine the format
of the NPT12 page tables

These are covered by the existing vmstate_svm_npt subsection.

On the other hand, the lack of something like VMXON/VMCS12 state means
that AMD already sorta works unless you're migrating while in guest
mode.  For Intel, just execute VMXON before migration, and starting any
VM after migration is doomed.

So, overall I prefer not to block migration.

Caught by "make check", not by me!

This commit is where bisection broke. :)
