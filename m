Title:
  Qemu 4.0.0-rc3 COLO Primary Crashes with "Assertion
  `event_unhandled_count > 0' failed."

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Hello Everyone,
  Now with Qemu 4.0.0-rc3, COLO is finally working so I gave it a try, but =
the Primary is always crashing during Network use. Typing fast in ssh or ru=
nning "top" with 0.1 second delay (change with 'd') reliably trigger the cr=
ash for me. I use the attached scripts to run Qemu, in my case both primary=
 and secondary run on the same Host for testing purposes. See the files in =
the attached .tar.bz2 for more Info, they also contain a Coredump.

  Regards,
  Lukas Straub

  ./configure --target-list=3Dx86_64-softmmu,i386-softmmu --enable-debug-in=
