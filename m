This is the follow up of
    "[PATCH RFC] memory: Don't allow to resize RAM while migrating" [1]

This series contains some (slightly modified) patches also contained in:
    "[PATCH v2 fixed 00/16] Ram blocks with resizable anonymous allocations
     under POSIX" [2]
That series will be based on this series. The last patch (#13) in this
series could be moved to the other series, but I decided to include it in
here for now (similar context).

I realized that resizing RAM blocks while the guest is being migrated
(precopy: resize while still running on the source, postcopy: resize
 while already running on the target) is buggy. In case of precopy, we
can simply cancel migration. Postcopy handling is more involved. Resizing
can currently happen during a guest reboot, triggered by ACPI rebuilds.

Along with the fixes, some cleanups.
