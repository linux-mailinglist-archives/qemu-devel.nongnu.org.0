So long as KVM_EXIT_HYPERCALL reports sufficient information so that
userspace can identify the cause as an SMC and retrieve the SMC
immediate field, this seems feasible.

For its own SMCCC APIs, KVM exclusively uses HVC, so rerouting SMC to
userspace shouldn't conflict.

This bouncing of SMCs to userspace would need to be opt-in, otherwise
old userspace would see exits that it doesn't know what to do with.

Something like that.

Interactions between SDEI and PSCI would need some thought: for example,
after PSCI_CPU_ON, the newly online cpu needs to have SDEs masked.

One option (suggested to me by James Morse) would be to allow userspace
to disable in the in-kernel PSCI implementation and provide its own
PSCI to the guest via SMC -- in which case userspace that wants to
implement SDEI would have to implement PSCI as well.

There may be reasons why this wouldn't work ... I haven't thought about
it in depth.

Cheers
