Versioning the set of cpu features a versioned machine type may enable is
a good idea, but I don't think we should add versioning to this API. Sinc=
e
it doesn't matter what gets returned by the expansion call as much as
whether or not it may be enabled, we can use both existence and permissio=
n
to control the enabling of features. And, we don't have to do it the same
way for all features. Here are some examples:

* The 'aarch64' feature doesn't exist on armv7 CPUs. So it can't be
  enabled there.

* The 'pmu' feature does exist on KVM armv7 CPUs, but KVM doesn't
  support it, so it can't be enabled there.

If we add features that could be enabled, but we don't want them to be
available to older machine types, then we can either ensure the CPU
property isn't added, or is removed, from the CPU model when that machine
type is in use, or we can add code to the enable function that fails
the enable when a machine type dependent condition check fails.

Does that answer the question?

Thanks,
drew
