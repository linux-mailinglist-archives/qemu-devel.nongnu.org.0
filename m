Hm, okay, makes sense. I had a definition in mind that says that filter
nodes only have a single child node. Is it that a filter may have only a
single _filtered_ child node?

But there is no reason why a node couldn't fulfill this condition for
more than one child node. bdrv_filtered_child() isn't well-defined then.
Technically, the description "Return any filtered child" is correct
because "any" can be interpreted as "an arbitrary", but obviously that
makes the function useless.

Specficially, according to your definition, qcow2 filters both the
backing file (COW filter) and the external data file (R/W filter).

We generally call this concept a "backing chain".

Agreed with offset, but with only size, it matches your definition of a
filter.

qcow2 doesn't fulfill the conditions for begin a filter driver. Two of
its possible children fulfill the conditions for being a filtered child.
You can pick either approach, talking about a "filter chain" just
doesn't make sense there. Either the chain is broken by a non-filter
driver like qcow2, or it must become a filter tree.

What we're really interested in is iterating the backing chain even
across filter nodes, so your implementation achieves the right result.
It just feels completely arbitrary, counterintuitive and confusing to
call this a (or actually "the") "filter chain" and to pretend that the
name tells anyone what it really is.
