I put my archeology hat, and went digging.

Streaming API was introduced on this commit:

commit 5a0c8e24395079f8e8cdc90aa1659cd5ab1b7427
Author: Yann Collet <yann.collet.73@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 01:20:36 2016 +0200

    new streaming API (compression)

And it first appears on v0.8.1 version.

Posting a better fix on toplevel.  If you want to try, I have changed it
to:

diff --git a/configure b/configure
index 7b373bc0bb..1bf48df1ef 100755

If you can check that this works for you, thanks.
