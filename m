The currently impl relies on the openat, fstatat, mkdirat, renameat,
utimensat, unlinkat functions. IIRC this was in order to deal with
various security vulnerabilities that exist due to race conditions.
AFAIK, there's no way to achieve the same with GIO as its a higher
level API which doesn't expose this kind of functionality
