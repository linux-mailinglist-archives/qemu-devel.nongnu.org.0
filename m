On s390 this info is all advertised/accessed via special instructions 
(my PoC qemu patch was intercepting one of these sorts of instructions 
from the guest and modifying it).

Yeah, I'm thinking we might need something to this effect for s390 at 
least.  But I'm curious if Niklas/Pierre have any add'l thoughts about 
that since they touched the virtfn stuff recently for s390 PCI.
