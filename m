This is a quite an old patch of ours that I upstream now to contribute=20
to community.
I will need to re-setup such environment for gathering exact performance=20
numbers.

Having said that, note that there isn't really a trade-off here between=20
better performance or something else.
We just expose a bit to guest that says to it: "You don't need to do=20
this useless thing that cause unnecessary VMExits. You can just do this=20
simple operation which is always better because we support it".
Therefore, as long as other guests just ignore this ACPI table (Which=20
they do as far as I've seen from the vast variety of instances we have=20
run on production for over 5 years), exposing this just have positive=20
effect.

Also note that besides VMware which expose it by default, you can also=20
see this exposed by default by some cloud hypervisors, such as GCP:

Windows measures at boot-time if the hardware have "changed too much"=20
since activation.
The way it does so, is calculating a "weighted diff score" based on a=20
number of hardware properties.

It is at least documented internally in Ravello that some guests have=20

changes.

Right. That's why I think it's a good practice to have this flag and tie=20
it to machine-type.
Guest-visible changes shouldn't be exposed to old machine-types.

The name of the spec is "Windows ACPI Emulated Devices Table".
You can see this by entering above link...

The above link is to version 1.0 of the document (Which as far as I=20
know, is the only version ever released).
So the bits exists in all revisions. Which documentation do you want me=20
to add then?

Also, according to your previous comment, I'm removing these bits=20
definitions from here and just putting (1 << 1)
directly in build_waet() code with a comment of what is the bit I'm=20
signaling there (i.e. PM_TIMER_GOOD).

Yes, it's named "RTC good" in spec.
Anyway, I removed this bit and it's documentation from v2 as you asked=20

Ok... Will change to your phrasing in v2.
