The issue isn't related to the legacy or modern way to configure CPU-to-NUMA association.
Note that qtests/numa-test also use the legacy way. For example, the issue can be triggered
with the following command lines where the modern configuration is used:

   /home/gavin/sandbox/qemu.main/build/qemu-system-aarch64            \
   -accel kvm -machine virt,gic-version=host                          \
   -cpu host -smp 6,sockets=2,clusters=1,cores=3,threads=1            \
   -m 768M,slots=16,maxmem=64G                                        \

   -object memory-backend-ram,id=mem1,size=256M                       \
   -object memory-backend-ram,id=mem2,size=256M                       \

Right, x86 can handle the irregular configuration well and we didn't find
any triggered warning messages there. As the subject indicates, it's a
ARM64 or riscv specific issue. Unfortunately, I failed to find the requirement,
socket-to-NUMA-node or cluster-to-NUMA-node 1:1 mapping from specs. However, it's not
sensible to split CPUs in one cluster to multiple NUMA nodes in a (ARM64 or RISCv)
baremetal environment. QEMU needs to emulate the environment close to the baremetal
machine if we can.

In summary, a warning message when multiple CPUs in one cluster are split to
multiple NUMA nodes, as Daniel suggested, sounds reasonable to me. Please let me
know your thoughts, Igor :)

Thanks,
Gavin
