Some random thoughts:
  a) Is there something that explicitly disallows SMM?
  b) I think all the interfaces you're using are already defined in
Linux header files - even if the code to implement them isn't actually
upstream in the kernel yet (the launch_update in particular) - we
normally wait for the kernel interface to be accepted before taking the
QEMU patches, but if the constants are in the headers already I'm not
sure what the rule is.
  c) What happens if QEMU reads the register values from the state if
the guest is paused - does it just see junk?  I'm just wondering if you
need to add checks in places it might try to.
