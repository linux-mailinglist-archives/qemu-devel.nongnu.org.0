I think, we can address it later, but it would be good to fit into one release cycle with these series, to not make incompatible behavior changes later.

Right. In my picture, "-(backing)->" means backing link. Hmm, most probably stream-filter is COR, which actually have file child. It doesn't matter here.

Hmm. I'm sure we already tried/discussed this.. But I don't remember the results. Seems, such logic should work as well. Andrey don't you remember? I think, the only difficulty is to update iotests 30 (in our stream-filter series) to use node-names, not filename.. Can we go this way?

Agree. I think stream-filter should be explicit, like recently introduced backup-top.

But this will never work with either way: base node may disappear during stream. Even with you way, they only stable thing is "above-base", which backing child may be completely another node at stream finish.

I don't, but I like the idea :)

And again, this is impossible even with your way. I have an idea:

What about making the whole thing explicit?

We add an optional parameter to stream-job: bottom-node, which is mutally exclusive with specifying base.

Then, if user specified base node, we freeze base as well, so it can't disappear. User will not be able to start parallel stream with this base node as top (because new stream can not insert a filter into frozen chain), but for sure it's rare case, used only in iotest 30 :)). Benefit: user have guarantee of what would be final backing node.

Otherwise, if user specified bottom-node, we use the way of this patch. So user can run parallel streams (iotest 30 will have to use bottom-node argument). No guarantee of final base-node, it would be backing of bottom-node at job finish.

But, this is incompatible change, and we probably should wait for 3 releases for deprecation of old behavior..

Anyway, I feel now, that you convinced me. I'm not sure that we will not have to change it make filter work, but not reason to change something now. Andrey, could you try to rebase your series on top of this and fix iotest 30 by just specifying  exact node-names in it?..


Hmmm. My thought goes further. Seems, that in this way, introducing explicit filter would be incompatible change anyway: it will break scenario with parallel stream jobs, when user specifies filenames, not node names (user will have to specify filter-node name as base for another stream job, as you said). So, it's incompatible anyway.

What do you think of it? Could we break this scenario in one release without deprecation and don't care? Than I think my idea about base vs bottom-node arguments for stream job may be applied. Or what to do?

If we can't break this scenario without a deprecation, we'll have to implement "implicit" filter, like for mirror, when filter-node-name is not specified. And for this implicit filter we'll need additional logic (closer to what I've proposed in a previous mail). Or, try to keep stream without a filter (not insert it at all and behave the old way), when filter-node-name is not specified. Than new features based on filter will be available only when filter-node-name is specified, but this is OK. The latter seems better for me.

We can break existing user scenarios.. Seems unlikely. I don't know.

Yes, absolutely agree. If we do it now, would it be incompatible change or not?

I also try to think about future introduction of stream filter. It shouldn't be a breaking change as well. But now I think it can be done the hard-way if needed: just work without a filter if filter-node-name is not given. but probably I care to much. Finally we can just drop the test-case from 030 or insert additional intermediate node into it..

Then, we should freeze base node again, so just revert c624b015bf14fe01

I go and see it cover-letter of the series introduced c624b015bf14fe01:

   This series introduces a bottom intermediate node that eliminates the
   dependency on the base that may change while stream job is running.
   It happens when stream/commit parallel jobs are running on the same
   backing chain. The base node of the stream job may be a top node of
   the parallel commit job and can change before the stream job is
   completed. We avoid that dependency by introducing the bottom node.

Hmm. Bad that we didn't add an iotest, but the series solved existing problem:
parallel stream and commit, as commit already has filter. Commit has filter
with "backing" child, so, I assume that the case worked prior to introducing
frozen chains, broken then by frozen chains and then fixed by c624b015bf14fe01.
Still I don't know are there some real users of such parallel jobs..

OK, at this point, I think, I'm OK with your patch in context of these series.

But I fill that something more should be done. Could we just revert c624b015bf14fe01 as "non corresponding to specification"?
