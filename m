This I've already done, along with multidevs=forbid.

Now I plan to run the PJD test suite from Tuxera with a simple
cross-device setup and --multidevs=remap. And that's it.

Makes sense. I don't think it is worth having a runtime warning,
but I'll turn remap to x-remap and amend the docs.

Yeah... this does a variety of tests I've never had time to
audit, but it exercices many paths of the 9pfs code.
