I can refactor that better in v2.

That is indeed a thought - why should qemu-img even TRY to call=20
bdrv_has_init_zero; it should instead call bdrv_make_zero(), which=20
should be as fast as possible (see my latest reply on 9/17 exploring=20
that idea more).  Under the hood, we can then make bdrv_make_zero() use=20
whatever tricks it needs, whether keeping the driver's=20
.bdrv_has_zero_init/_truncate callbacks, adding another callback, making=20
write_zeroes faster, or whatever, but instead of making qemu-img sort=20
through multiple ideas, the burden would now be hidden in the block layer.

And this series DOES improve the case for preallocated qcow2 images, by=20
virtue of a new qcow2 autoclear bit.  But again, that may be something=20
we want to hide in the driver callback interfaces, while qemu-img just=20
blindly calls bdrv_make_zero() and gets success (the image now reads as=20
zeroes, either because it was already that way or we did something=20
quick) or failure (it is a waste of time to prezero, whether by=20
write_zeroes or by trim or by truncate, so just manually write zeroes as=20
part of your image copying).

qemu-img convert to an NBD destination cannot create the destination, so=20
it ALWAYS has to use -n.  I don't know how often users are likely to=20
wire up a command line for qemu-img convert with NBD as the destination,=20
or whether you are correct that it will be a management app able to=20
supply -n (and thus able to supply --target-is-zero).  But at the same=20
time, can a management app learn whether it is safe to supply=20
--target-is-zero?  With my upcoming NBD patches, 'qemu-img --list' will=20
show whether the NBD target is known to start life all zero, and a=20
management app could use mechanism to decide when to pass=20
--target-is-zero (whether a management app would actually fork qemu-img=20
--list, or just be an NBD client itself to do the same thing qemu-img=20
would do, is beside the point).

Similarly, this series includes enhancements to 'qemu-img info' on qcow2=20
images known to currently read as zero; again, that sort of information=20
is necessary somewhere in the chain, whether it be because qemu-img=20
consumes the information itself, or because the management app consumes=20
the information in order to pass the --target-is-zero option to=20
qemu-img, either way, the information needs to be available for consumption=
.

Maybe, but it is just shifting the burden between who consumes the=20
information that an image is all zero, and how the consumption of that=20
information is passed to qemu-img.

Yes, that is one of the immediately obvious fallouts from this series -=20
you can now create a preallocated qcow2 image in one process, and the=20
next process using that image can readily tell that it is still=20
just-created.

At any rate, I think you've convinced me to rethink how I present v2=20
(maybe not by refactoring bdrv_known_zeroes usage, but instead=20
refactoring bdrv_make_zero), but that the qcow2 autoclear bit is still a=20
useful feature to have.
