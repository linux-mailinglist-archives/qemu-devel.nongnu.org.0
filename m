([PATCH v3 00/41] Mirror map JIT memory for TCG)

These set of changes brings QEMU TCG to iOS devices and future Apple Silicon
devices. They were originally developed last year and have been working in the
UTM app. Recently, we ported the changes to master, re-wrote a lot of the build
script changes for meson, and broke up the patches into more distinct units.

A summary of the changes:

* `CONFIG_IOS` defined when building for iOS and iOS specific changes (as well
  as unsupported code) are gated behind it.
* A new dependency, libucontext is added since iOS does not have native ucontext
  and broken support for sigaltstack. libucontext is available as a new option
  for coroutine backend.
* For (recent) jailbroken iOS devices as well as upcoming Apple Silicon devices,
  there are new rules for applications supporting JIT (with the proper
  entitlement). These rules are implemented as well.

Since v4:

* Updated QAPI schema for CONFIG_HOST_BLOCK_DEVICE
* Updated maintainers file for iOS host support
* Moved system() changes to osdep.h
* Fixed typo in libucontext meson.build change

Since v3:

* Moved mirror JIT support to a different patch set.
* Removed dependency on `pthread_jit_write_protect_np` because it was redundent
  and also crashes if called on a non-jailbroken iOS device.
* Removed `--enable-cross-compile` option
* Fixed checkpatch errors
* Fixed iOS build on master due to new test recently added which calls system()

Since v2:

* Changed getting mirror pointer from a macro to inline functions
* Split constification of TCG code pointers to separate patch
* Removed slirp updates (will send future patch once slirp changes are in)
* Removed shared library patch (will send future patch)
