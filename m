I've mostly tested hotplugging but cold plugged should work as well.=20

Yes, that's how I expected it to work. In my tests the pci address was
the same on destination and source host but that was more by accident. I
think the libvirt XML on the destination just needs to have the pci
address of nic of the same type for it to work.=20

Yes, so I think that's part of the 'partial' unplug I'm trying to
figure out add the moment.=20

So the re-plugging of the device on the destination is not in the v1
of the patches, which I failed to mention, my bad. I will sent out a v2
that has this part as well shortly. I added a runstate change handler
that is called on the destination when the run state changes from INMIGRA=
TE
to something else. When the new state is RUNNING I hotplug the primary de=
vice.=20

I think I don't understand what happens during the prepare phase on
the destination. Need to look into that. But I think I had an error in
my logic that I need to plug the device from QEMU on the destination
side. You're saying we could just always cold plug it directly when
the VM is started. I think an exception would be when the guest was
migrated before we added the primary device on the source, so before
virtio feature negotiation.
