What I wanted to say is that there are indeed probably cases where
migrating the frequency is unnecessary. For example if we only use the
callback and never fetch the frequency outside it: if the frequency is
only used to compute something which is already saved/loaded during
migration.

But yes we could just do as you say. It's probably less confusing.
