I recently understood legal changes can be very complex, thus it is
implicit it can take years before getting updates.

Since the project is still actively developed, maybe you could provide
a Azure CI job to build a WHPX binary. We don't need to have access to
the binary, just to the exit status (success/fail) and build logs.

Do you think it is doable?

Thanks,

Phil.

Title:
  QEMU installer with WHPX support

Status in QEMU:
  Opinion

Bug description:
  People often ask the community to add WHPX support to the QEMU installer =
for Windows,
  but it is impossible due to the license limitations of the WHPX SDK.

  The WinHvEmulation.h and WinHvPlatform.h header files needed are "All
  rights reserved".

  However these headers only contain struct definitions and integer constan=
ts,
  no functional code in macros or inline functions. See:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg645815.html
  It is questionable whether the headers alone can be considered copyrighta=
ble material.
