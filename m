Your patch series is reasonable.  I don't think it's too bad.

The main question is how to detect the XFS fix once it ships.  XFS
already has a ton of ioctls, so maybe they don't mind adding a
feature/quirk bit map ioctl for publishing information about bug fixes
to userspace.  I didn't see another obvious way of doing it, maybe a
mount option that the kernel automatically sets and that gets reported
to userspace?

If we imagine that XFS will not provide a mechanism to detect the
presence of the fix, then could we ask QEMU package maintainers to
./configure --disable-xfs-fallocate-beyond-eof-workaround at some point
in the future when their distro has been shipping a fixed kernel for a
while?  It's ugly because it doesn't work if the user installs an older
custom-built kernel on the host.  But at least it will cover 98% of
users...

My favorite because it is clean and simple, but Vladimir has a valid
use-case for requiring this performance optimization so reverting isn't
an option.
