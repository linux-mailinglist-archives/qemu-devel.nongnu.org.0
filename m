But it seems like the current patch does match what's Microsoft HyperV 
is publishing in it's APCI tables.

I dont think it's correct for us to "fix" Microsoft emulation even if 
it's wrong, since that's what Windows probably expects to see...

I tried looking where Microsoft uses the ACPI tables to identify the 
VMBus but without much luck in order to understand how flexible a change 
would be for the OS to still detect the VMBus device, but in general 
I think "correcting" something that is emulated 1:1 because there is no 
spec is the right way.
