I tested a few macos cirrus-ci builds after the meson conversion and found that they 
were working fine, so whatever is affecting the macos build must be related to a QEMU 
change.

A full bisect proved to be too tricky due to the instability of the tree at that 
point in time, however reading through "git log" and attempting some builds at merges 
I thought might be related I discovered that the slowness was introduced by this PR:

Fortunately that PR could be bisected and that led me this commit:


9ce44e2ce267caf5559904a201aa1986b0a8326b is the first bad commit
commit 9ce44e2ce267caf5559904a201aa1986b0a8326b

     qmp: Move dispatcher to a coroutine

     This moves the QMP dispatcher to a coroutine and runs all QMP command
     handlers that declare 'coroutine': true in coroutine context so they
     can avoid blocking the main loop while doing I/O or waiting for other
     events.

     For commands that are not declared safe to run in a coroutine, the
     dispatcher drops out of coroutine context by calling the QMP command
     handler from a bottom half.

Given that Peter can run the tests manually, I'm not exactly sure why the cirrus-ci 
environment is different - all I can think of is that it could be related to running 
in a headless terminal.

For reference running cirrus-ci on the last good commit 04f22362f1 "qapi: Add a 
'coroutine' flag for commands" gave me a total runtime of 35 mins.


ATB,

Mark.
