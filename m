The existing location of internal snapshots IS already stored separately 
from guest-data space, precisely because it is beyond EOF.

How will adding redundant fields help?  Both fields are already present 
in the snapshot table of v3 images (even if indirectly) by virtue of:

         32 - 35:    Size of the VM state in bytes. 0 if no VM state is 
saved.
                     If there is VM state, it starts at the first cluster
                     described by first L1 table entry that doesn't 
describe a
                     regular guest cluster (i.e. VM state is stored like 
guest
                     disk content, except that it is stored at offsets 
that are
                     larger than the virtual disk presented to the guest)

                     Byte 40 - 47:   Size of the VM state in bytes. 0 if 
no VM
                                     state is saved. If this field is 
present,
                                     the 32-bit value in bytes 32-35 is 
ignored.

                     Byte 48 - 55:   Virtual disk size of the snapshot 
in bytes

which gives you both the 64-bit size (in order to compute the last 
cluster accessible to the guest, and thus the next cluster available to 
the vmstate beyond EOF) and the 64-bit length of that vmstate.
