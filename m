Ok, but all of this needa to be documented somewhere. This raises a
couple of questions to me:

What happens on

- IPL Clear with this special memory? Will it be detached/away afterwards?
- IPL Normal? "Obviously" it must stay otherwise kdump would never see
  that memory.

And when you write it's up to the device driver what to with that
memory: is there any documentation available what all of this is good
for? I would assume _most likely_ this extra memory is going to be
added to ZONE_MOVABLE _somehow_ so that it can be taken away also. But
since it is not normal memory, like you say, I'm wondering how that is
supposed to work.

As far as I can tell there would be a lot of inconsistencies in
userspace interfaces which provide memory / zone information. Or I'm
not getting the point of all of this at all.

So please provide more information, or a pointer to documentation.
