While GitLab let's you run x86 code for free with the "Linux Shared
Runners"[1], I don't think it would be suitable to what we're trying
to achieve.  It's limited to a single OS (CoreOS), single architecture
and really geared towards running containers.  BTW, if it isn't clear,
this is the approach being used today for the jobs defined on
".gitlab-ci.yml".

IMO we can leverage and still expand on the use of the "Linux Shared
Runners", but to really get a grasp oh how well this model can work
for QEMU, we'll need "Specific Runners", because we're validating
how/if we can depend on it for OS/architectures they don't support on
shared runners (and sometimes not even for the gitlab-runner agent).

I'm sorry I missed the original discussions, and I'm even more sorry
if that led to any misunderstandings here.

Right, while we've tried to streamline the process of setting up the
machines, there will be plenty of changes to improve the automation.

More importantly, maintaining the machines is very important to the
super important goal of catching code regressions only, and not facing
other failures.  Mundane tasks such as making sure enough disk space
is always available can be completely change the perception of the
usefulness of a CI environment.  And for this maintenance, we need
help from people "owning" those machines.

^ THIS.  I have to say that I'm still amazed as to how Peter has
managed to automate, integrate and run all those tests in such varied
environments for so long.  Major kudos!
