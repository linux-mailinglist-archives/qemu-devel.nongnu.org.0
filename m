Ultimately there's no solution that is guaranteed to work. If $HOME
or $TMPDIR point to paths that are >= 108 chars long, we're doomed
no matter what. To maximise the liklihood of working though, we need
to be minimal in paths we append. 

Right now, Peter's TMPDIR is

/var/folders/d7/rz20f6hd709c1ty8f6_6y_z40000gn/T

Onto which QEMU appends

  /avo_qemu_sock_uh3w_dgc/qemu-37331-10bacf110-monitor.sock

IOW, QEMU is more than 1/2 of the problem here.

QEMU could cut down the size of the temporary directory using a more
concise pattern, changing

  tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(prefix="avo_qemu_sock_")

To

  tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(prefix="qemu_")


And then use a fixed socket name 'qmp.sock', giving us:

  /qemu_uh3w_dgc/qmp.sock

to append to TMPDIR

Daniel
