That's good, it seems that this is already fairly close to how it works for -device
at the moment.

I don't think that it is possible to come up a single place for on-board devices to
live directly though. Going back to one of my first examples: wiring up a chardev to
a serial port on the macio device. To me it makes sense for that to exist in QOM
under /machine/pci-bus/mac-io/escc. In contrast an in-built NIC could live under
/machine/pci-bus/in-built/nic, and placing one or both of these devices directly
under /machine/foo doesn't feel intuitive.

AFAIK as per your ARM virt example I believe it is only possible to register an alias
for a property rather than for an Object? The ultimate aim would be for
object_resolve_path("/machine/builtin/nic0") and
object_resolve_path("/machine/pci-bus/in-built/nic") to return the same Object, and
for the aliases on built-in devices to be children of /machine/builtin to allow easy
iteration and introspection.


ATB,

Mark.
