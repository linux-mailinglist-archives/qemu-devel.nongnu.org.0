Thanks Aleksandar.

Yes.

My main reasons for not wanting this dragged out any longer are:

1) Personally, I just want to let go of it now, and that's slightly
   harder to do when I'm still keeping an eye on whether this patch is
   merged yet, or worse, waiting for Wave to act.

2) In principle it feels wrong to delay a maintainer's name being
   removed at their own request (even if it came late!) for an
   indeterminate amount of time. This patch simply shouldn't be blocked
   waiting for Wave to make a decision I've been waiting to see if it
   would make for too long already.

3) Maybe publicly recognising the orphaned state might motivate Wave or
   others to step up and take a lead with further development.

LOL, well I doubt MIPS (as a company) was under any illusion since they
pulled the trigger :-P

Seriously though, I intended to keep an eye on things in my own time
(both on kernel & QEMU side) and just be ready to answer questions and
hand over the reigns if/when somebody from Wave got up to speed. I was
probably also wary of making MIPS look bad for closing their UK
operation (again) and "orphaning" my code (that I was probably too
emotionally invested in, LOL!).

In practice Paul took care of the MIPS arch stuff and there was
virtually no activity on the MIPS KVM front from Wave so real life
mostly pushed it off my radar. I did discuss orphaning it with Paul last
year but there was mention of Wave folk getting up to speed with it so I
held off for a bit longer.

Anyway FWIW I'm sorry for any confusion caused by my hesitation.

Thanks, my pleasure.
