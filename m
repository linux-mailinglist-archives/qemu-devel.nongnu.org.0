Hundreds of serialized QMP roundtrips are certainly bad.

Sending hundreds of QMP commands before reading any QMP output would
also be bad: it relies on QEMU to buffer the output.  It does, but
unlimited buffering is bad, and you shouldn't rely on it to stay.

Instead, send your input as fast as QEMU accepts it (it *will* stop
reading if you send input faster than it can process it), and also
receive output as fast as you can, until you got it all.
