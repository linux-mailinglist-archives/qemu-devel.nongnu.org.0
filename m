My understanding is that we don't need a particularly low-level API to
interact with. The host virtual device is receiving the whole encoded
data, and can thus easily reconstruct the original stream (minus the
container) and pass it to ffmpeg/gstreamer. So we can be pretty
high-level here.

Now the choice of API will also determine whether we want to allow
emulation of codec devices, or whether we stay on a purely
para-virtual track. If we use e.g. gstreamer, then the host can
provide a virtual device that is backed by a purely software
implementation. This can be useful for testing purposes, but for
real-life usage the guest would be just as well using gstreamer
itself.

If we want to make sure that there is hardware on the host side, then
an API like libva might make more sense, but it would be more
complicated and may not support all hardware (I don't know if the V4L2
backends are usable for instance).
