Actually QEMU does not use auto* tools, it just has a configure script=20
that mimics that. This may not be the best way to do it but this is=20
convenient for people trying to compile it and works as expected so I=20
think this behaviour should be preserved if possible just to not upset=20
developers and packagers unnecessarily.
