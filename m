I don't think this is an issue since only newly created guests are
affected.  Existing machine types are unchanged.

The NVMe card I've been testing has 64 queues.  Let's keep the virtio
limit roughly the same as real hardware.  That way, multi-queue block
layer support in QEMU will be able to fully exploit the hardware
(similar to how we size request queues to be larger than the common 64
/sys/block/FOO/queue/nr_requests).

The point of this change is to improve performance on SMP guests.
Setting the limit to 4-8 is too low, since it leaves guests that most
need this optimization with a sub-optimal configuration.

I will create a 32 vCPU guest with 100 virtio-blk devices and verify
that enabling multi-queue is successful.

Stefan
