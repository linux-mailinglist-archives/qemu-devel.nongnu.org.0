Yes.

-set is even more obscure than -global.  It modifies existing QemuOpts.
You could use it to monkey-patch a -device to the left, or a [device]
from a -readconfig file to the left, which is a bit more useful.  You
can't use it to configure onboard devices, because there is no QemuOpts
to monkey-patch for them.

qdev already supports identifying a node in this tree by its path, but
these qdev paths are FUBAR.

Moreover, the qtree misses "busless" devices.

The QOM tree should be as complete as possible, i.e. lack only non-qdev
devices[*].  It also has sane paths.  Have a look at "info qom-tree",
please.

[*] It's been eleven years.  Device models that still ignore qdev need
to be taken out and shot, along with the machine types using them.  Any
machine types we actually miss then need to be revived and fixed up.
