Could you please always use ppc-next to queue patches for the next 
upcoming version and ppc-7.2 for the current version? Unless this makes 
your workflow harder in which case ignore this but the reason I ask is 
because then it's enough for me to only track ppc-next if I need to rebase 
patches on that and don't have to add a new branch at every release 
(unless I have some patches to rebase on it during a freeze but that's 
less likely than rebasing on your queued patches for the next release xo 
using version for the current branch and keep next for the future versions 
makes more sense to me).

Or you could break indentation and not start at the ( but 3 chars back. I.e.:

create_unimplemented_device("esdhc",
                          pmc->ccsrbar_base + MPC85XX_ESDHC_REGS_OFFSET,
                          MPC85XX_ESDHC_REGS_SIZE);

But I think it can be just ignored in this case.

I think the consensus was to keep 80 columns if possible, this is good 
becuase you can open more files side by side (although it does not match 
well with the long _ naming convention of glib and qemu)  but we have a 
distinction between checkpatch warning and error in line length. I think 
it will give error at 90 chars but as long as it's just warns that means: 
fix it if you can but in rare cases if it's more readable with a slightly 
longer line then it is still acceptable. I think that's the case here, 
splitting the line would be less readable than a few chars longer line.
