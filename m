Checked.

Yes, it inherits pair of fn and local_err, and it definitely makes sense. It more stable.

Consider the following example:

# cat a.c
int f1(Error **errp)
{
     Error *err1 = NULL;
     int err2 = 0;

     error_propagate(errp, err1);

     return err2;
}

int f2(Error **errp)
{
     Error *err2 = NULL;
     int err1 = 0;

     error_propagate(errp, err2);

     return err1;
}


My script works correct and produces this change:
--- a.c
+++ /tmp/cocci-output-1753-10842a-a.c
@@ -1,19 +1,15 @@
  int f1(Error **errp)
  {

      int err2 = 0;

-
      return err2;
  }

  int f2(Error **errp)
  {
-    Error *err2 = NULL;
+    ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
      int err1 = 0;

-    error_propagate(errp, err2);
-
      return err1;
  }


But yours script is caught:

@@ -1,19 +1,15 @@

  }


- see, it touches err1, which is unrelated to Error in f2. Hmm, interesting that it doesn't want to convert err1 declaration:)

- this is because relation between local_err and fn is lost.

So, understanding that there no such cases in the whole tree, and even if your patch works faster on the whole tree, I still don't want to drop inheritance, because it's just a correct thing to do. Yes, we've added ____ helper. It helps to avoid some problems. Pair-inheritance helps to avoid another problems. I understand, that there still may other, not-covered problems, but better to be as safe as possible. And inheritance here is native and correct thing to do, even with our ____ additional helper. What do you think?
