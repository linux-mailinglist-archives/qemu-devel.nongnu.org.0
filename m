This series delay timer_new from init into realize to avoid memleaks when=
 we call 'device_list_properties'.
And do timer_free only in s390x_cpu_finalize because it's hotplugable. Ho=
wever, mos6522_realize is never called=20
at all due to the incorrect creation of it. So we aslo fix the incorrect =
creation in mac_via first, then move the
timer_new to mos6522_realize().

v1:
   - Delay timer_new() from init() to realize() to fix memleaks.
v2:
   - Similarly to other cleanups, move timer_new into realize in target/s=
390x/cpu.c (Suggested by Philippe Mathieu-Daud=C3=A9).
   - Send these two patches as a series instead of send each as a single =
patch but with wrong subject in v1.
v3:
   - It's not valid in mos6522 if we move timer_new from init to realize,=
 because it's never called at all.
     Thus, we remove null check in reset, and add calls to mos6522_realiz=
e() in mac_via_realize to make this move to be valid.
   - split patch by device to make it more clear.
v4:
   - Aslo do timer_free on the error path in realize() and fix some codin=
g style. Then use device_class_set_parent_unrealize to declare unrealize.=
=20
   - split the mos6522 patch into two, one to fix incorrect creation of m=
os6522, the other to fix memleak.
