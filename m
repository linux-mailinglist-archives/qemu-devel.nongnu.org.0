RISC-V allows another option: support for fine-grained PMPs is optional, which
allows implementations ignore this issue to save on hardware costs.  It looks
like Rocket leaves this as a parameter

   https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/rocket/TLB.scala#L159

but our implementations always have page-granularity PMPs if virtual memory is
supported.

Unless anyone objects, I'll restrict the PMP granularity to 4K on all systems
that support virtual memory as a bug fix.  We can add the configuration option
in as a feature.
