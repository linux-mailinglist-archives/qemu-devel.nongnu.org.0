The specification claims "Each expression that isn't an include
directive may be preceded by a documentation block", but the code also
rejects them for pragma directives.  The code is correct.  Fix the
specification.

The specification reserves member names starting with 'has_', but the
code also reserves name 'u'.  Fix the specification.

The specification claims "The string 'max' is not allowed as an enum
value".  Untrue.  Fix the specification.  While there, delete the
naming advice, because it's redundant with the naming rules in section
"Schema overview"

The specification claims "No branch of the union can be named 'max',
as this would collide with the implicit enum".  Untrue.  Fix the
specification.

The specification claims "It is not allowed to name an event 'MAX',
since the generator also produces a C enumeration of all event names
with a generated _MAX value at the end."  Untrue.  Fix the
specification.

The specification claims "All branches of the union must be complex
types", but the code permits only struct types.  The code is correct.
Fix the specification.

The specification claims a command's return type "must be the string
name of a complex or built-in type, a one-element array containing the
name of a complex or built-in type" unless the command is in pragma
'returns-whitelist'.  The code does not permit built-in types.  Fix
the specification.
