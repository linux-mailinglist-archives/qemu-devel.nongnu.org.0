Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the quick answer :)

My question is confused because the problem is not clear to me...

Well, maybe this is more an emulation problem rather than a block
one. But system emulation consumes block layer :)

The problem is when emulating devices such NOR Flash (parallel mapping
or SD cards) we expect the block driver being a plain file (either "raw"
format or another) but a "regular" file. When an user passes something
else like a block device, odd things happen.

Well, I guess I self-restricted my question to device emulation. So
in the cases mentioned I would like to add a check in sd_realize()/
pflash_cfi0?_realize() for regular file when a block drive is provided.

Description of problematic user case:

* -pflash /dev/sda
* -sd /dev/mmcblk0

User runs emulation on top of hardware (maybe like passthru?), and
expect underlying block to be in correct state out of QEMU.

Thanks,

Phil.
