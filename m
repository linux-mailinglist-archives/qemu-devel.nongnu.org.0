You can keep it for until after the blockdev dust has settled. It would
"just" be to address the deprecation since QEMU 2.8, not because of any
functional change.

Well, the question is what to do on the QEMU side then. Deprecation
should mean that we have a plan for removing the feature. If we're
planning to keep the feature indefinitely because libvirt needs it, we
might want to consider removing the deprecation notice.

(Though honestly, keeping this one indefinitely feels wrong because
using file names to identify nodes was really one of the worse ideas.)
