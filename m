Nice approach! Thanks for solving this at the hw/core/bus.c level so
that other devices can benefit too.

Regarding drive_del, I guess the issue here is that this HMP command's
semantics need to include not synchronize_rcu() but some kind of
drain_call_rcu() operation as well that ensures deletion has completed?

This also suggests that all code that removes bus children needs to be
audited since the actual object unref is now deferred to a later point
in time. There could be other cases besides drive_del that don't yet
handle this.

drain_call_rcu() can be implemented by invoking call_rcu(temp,
drain_call_rcu_cb, rcu) where drain_call_rcu_cb() sets a QemuEvent that
the caller is waiting on. This way the caller can be sure that all
previously queued call_rcu() callbacks have completed. call_rcu_thread()
needs to be tweaked to avoid g_usleep() and instead use a timed wait so
that drain_call_rcu() can immediately wake up the thread.
