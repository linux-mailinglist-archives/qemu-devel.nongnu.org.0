Ooops. I admit the assumption was that most people running system
emulation would be doing it on beefier machines.

So I'm glad you have the workaround.=20

The problem we have is any number we pick here is arbitrary. And while
it did regress your use-case changing it again just pushes a performance
regression onto someone else. The most (*) 64 bit desktop PCs have 16Gb
of RAM, almost all have more than 8gb. And there is a workaround.

I'm definitely against re-introducing ram_size into the mix. The
original commit (a1b18df9a4) that broke this introduced an ordering
dependency which we don't want to bring back.

I'd be more amenable to something that took into account host memory and
limited the default if it was smaller than a threshold. Is there a way
to probe that that doesn't involve slurping /proc/meminfo?
