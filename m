So, at least for unconditional branches it's possible - you could
parse the instruction and place your breakpoint on the target.  For
conditional branches it would be much harder, but they are much less
likely as the very first instruction on the interrupt vector.

I do think we should at least detect and flag some sort of error in
this situation though.

Ah, right.  Basically the issue is that kvm_insert_breakpoint() takes
an effective address, not a real address, but it might be happening in
a different context than we're executing right now.

Ok, that makes sense.  Though.. aren't you always inserting the
breakpoint into an interrupt vector?  So wouldn't it always be MMU
off?  Under what circumstances would this get called with mmu_on =3D
true?

Hm, ok.

I'm not sure what you mean by "for the purposes of AIL".
