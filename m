I don't think this is as nice because stopping or resuming a device
could involve some async operation (e.g. be delegated to a BH). In this
case, a device on a child bus must still wait for the BH (or other async
part) to be completed before it can resume its own operation.

Basically, a single flat list of global VM state handlers wasn't a good
design, because what we actually need in such cases is something
hierarchical.
