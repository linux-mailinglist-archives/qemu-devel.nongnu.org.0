It may not be necessary now or ever to test more than one CPU for the
PMU feature, but without a good reason to change it to a machine
property then I'd prefer we always to the N-1 pointless checks. The
feature is a CPU feature, not a machine feature, so, IMO, it should
remain something configured and tested at the CPU level, not the machine
level.

Are you trying to configure heterogeneous mach-virt machines? Or machines
that only provide PMUs to some CPUs? If not, then I'm not sure why this
would be a problem. Indeed it's likely a pointless check and, instead of
silently returning, it should output a warning or even assert. Otherwise,
I don't see a problem with it, since we want to be sure we're dealing with
the type of configuration we expect, i.e. one where each CPU has a PMU if
any CPU has a PMU.

Thanks,
