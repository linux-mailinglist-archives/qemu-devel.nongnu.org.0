Hi=EF=BC=8C Paolo and Michal=EF=BC=9A

Base on my patch, I found another problem is that=EF=BC=9A

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 qemu: report DISCONNECTED

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 libvirt: start pr-helper #1, but it will takes a whil=
e to complete=20
this action

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 qemu: reconnect to start pr-helper #1 immediately and=
 failed, so=20
report DISCONNECTED

 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 libvirt: begin to call qemuProcessStartManagedPRDaemo=
n to start=20
pr-helper #2, but virPidFileAcquirePath failed, so close fd and unlink=20
pidfile by mistake


based on the above problem, I thought out two ways to fix this problem:

1. qemu: when call pr_manager_helper_write failed, sleep one second to=20
make sure libvirt had started pr-helper before call=20
pr_manager_helper_initialize.

2. libvirt: if virFileLock failed in virPidFileAcquirePath, not to close=20
fd and unlink pidfile, because pr-helper #1 is using the pidfile.

what kind of the two above solutions is better? please give me some=20
advice, thanks.
