AFAICT, nothing is setting up the mapping, hence my question in the first
review of this patch, that this patch seems incomplete.

The subuid/subgid files are essentially just reserving a range of IDs
for each user. Something then needs to read & honour those IDs.

The rules on setting up a mapping are complex though, to avoid a user
from creating a new user namespace, and defining a mapping that lets
them elevate privileges to read files in the host they wouldn't otherwise
be permitted to access.

IIUC, applying the range of IDs from subuid/subgid will require the
process defining the mapping to have CAP_SETUID *outside* the container.
As an unprivileged host user, you won't have that, so I think the only
thing you can do is setup a mapping for your own UID/GID, which would
allow the container to read/write files owned by the host user that
started it. That should be ok for virtiofsd's needs at least for simple
file sharing. If virtiofsd needs to expose its full range of features
though, something privileged in the host needs to setup a full mapping
based on subuid/subgid

BTW, "man user_namespaces" gives many more details on UID mapping
rules.

The UID map inside the container will be empty, which should result in
all files being remapped to (uid_t)-1 or whatever is shown in the
/proc/sys/kernel/overflow{u,g}id files.

So virtiofsd would not have any write access, and only have read access
to files which have world-read bit set.

Daniel
