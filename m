Ok, while refactoring this, could you add a scary warning next to the
sigaction calls mentioning that this code is not likely to play well
with qemu's other handling of sigbus, as a reminder to future reviewers.

The failure mode is likely to be silent or easily mis-interpreted

Is there any value in emitting a one-time per process warning message
on stderr if we take the old codepath post-startup ?
