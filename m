It *will* break TLS, because it will cause the TLS code to lookup
an object with the ID of "".  NULL must be preserved when calling
the TLS APIs.

The assignment of "" to tls_hostname would also have broken TLS,
so the migration_tls_channel_connect method had to turn it back
into a real NULL.

The use of "" for tls_creds will similarly cause it to try and
lookup an object with ID of "", and fail. That one's harmless
though, because it would also fail if it were NULL.
