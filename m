Hi!=0D
=0D
This is a patch series that is a result of my discussion with Paulo on=0D
how to correctly fix the root cause of the BZ #1812399.=0D
=0D
The root cause of this bug is the fact that IO thread is running mostly=0D
unlocked versus main thread on which device hotplug is done.=0D
=0D
qdev_device_add first creates the device object, then places it on the bus,=
=0D
and only then realizes it.=0D
=0D
However some drivers and currently only virtio-scsi enumerate its child bus=
=0D
devices on each request that is received from the guest and that can happen=
 on the IO=0D
thread.=0D
=0D
Thus we have a window when new device is on the bus but not realized and ca=
n be accessed=0D
by the virtio-scsi driver in that state.=0D
=0D
Fix that by doing two things:=0D
=0D
1. Add partial RCU protection to the list of a bus's child devices.=0D
This allows the scsi IO thread to safely enumerate the child devices=0D
while it races with the hotplug placing the device on the bus.=0D
=0D
2. Make the virtio-scsi driver check .realized property of the scsi device=
=0D
and avoid touching the device if it isn't=0D
=0D
Note that in the particular bug report the issue wasn't a race but rather d=
ue=0D
to combination of things, the .realize code in the middle managed to trigge=
r IO on the virtqueue=0D
which caused the virtio-scsi driver to access the half realized device. How=
ever=0D
since this can happen as well with real IO thread, this patch series was do=
ne,=0D
which fixes this as well.=0D
=0D
Changes from V1:=0D
  * Patch 2 is new, as suggested by Stefan, added drain_call_rcu() to fix t=
he failing unit test,=0D
    make check pass now=0D
=0D
  * Patches 6,7 are new as well: I added scsi_device_get as suggested by St=
efan as well, although=0D
    this is more a refactoring that anything else as it doesn't solve=0D
    an existing race.=0D
=0D
  * Addressed most of the review feedback from V1=0D
    - still need to decide if we need QTAILQ_FOREACH_WITH_RCU_READ_LOCK=0D
=0D
Changes from V2:=0D
=0D
  * No longer RFC=0D
  * Addressed most of the feedback from Stefan=0D
  * Fixed reference count leak in patch 7 when device is about to be unreal=
ized=0D
  * Better testing=0D
=0D
This series was tested by adding a virtio-scsi drive with iothread,=0D
then running fio stress job in the guest in a loop, and then adding/removin=
g=0D
the scsi drive on the host in the loop.=0D
This test was failing usually on 1st iteration withouth this patch series,=
=0D
and now it seems to work smoothly.=0D
=0D
Best regards,=0D

Maxim Levitsky (7):=0D
  scsi/scsi_bus: switch search direction in scsi_device_find=0D
  Implement drain_call_rcu and use it in hmp_device_del=0D
  device-core: use RCU for list of childs of a bus=0D
  device-core: use atomic_set on .realized property=0D
  virtio-scsi: don't touch scsi devices that are not yet realized or=0D
    about to be un-realized=0D
  scsi: Add scsi_device_get=0D
  virtio-scsi: use scsi_device_get=0D
