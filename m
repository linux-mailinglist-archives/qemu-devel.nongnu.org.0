ARM's Scalable Vector Registers which currently can get upto 16 vector
quads (256 bytes) but are likely to get bigger.

Are these limits of the protocol rather than our own internal limits?

Glib provides some nice functions for managing arbitrary sized strings
in a nice flexible way which grow on demand. There is also a nice
growable GByteArray type which we can use for the packet buffer. I think
I'd started down this road of re-factoring but never got around to
posting the patches.

Sure - but guest registers are growing all the time!
