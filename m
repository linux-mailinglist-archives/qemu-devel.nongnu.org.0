That's useful to know.  Thanks!

Which version of gluster first required a regular filesystem backing for 
all gluster files?  Does qemu support older versions (in which case, 
what is the correct version-probing invocation to return 0 prior to that 
point, and 1 after), or do all versions supported by qemu already 
guarantee zero initialization on creation or widening truncation by 
virtue of POSIX file semantics (in which case, patch 7 should instead 
switch to using .bdrv_has_zero_init_1 for both functions)?  Per 
configure, we probe for glusterfs_xlator_opt from gluster 4, which 
implies the code still tries to be portable to even older gluster, but 
I'm not sure if this squares with qemu-doc.texi which mentions our 
minimum distro policy (for example, now that qemu requires python 3 
consistent with our distro policy, that rules out several older systems 
where older gluster was likely to be present).

I'm respinning the series for other reasons, but would like to get this 
right as part of that respin.
