Title:
  qemu-system-ppc: Floating point instructions do not properly generate
  the SPE/Embedded Floating-Point Unavailable interrupt

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  When emulating certain floating point instructions or vector
  instructions on PowerPC machines, QEMU does not properly generate the
  SPE/Embedded Floating-Point Unavailable interrupt.

  As described in the Signal Processing Engine (SPE) Programming
  Environments Manual, Rev. 0, available at https://www.nxp.com/docs/en
  /reference-manual/SPEPEM.pdf:

  > An SPE/embedded floating-point unavailable exception occurs on an attem=
pt to execute any of the
  > following instructions and MSR[SPV] is not set:
  > * SPE instruction (except brinc)
  > * An embedded scalar double-precision instruction
  > * A vector single-precision floating-point instructions
  > It is not used by embedded scalar single-precision floating-point instr=
uctions

  This behavior was partially reported in Bug #1611394, however the
  issue is larger than what is described in that bug. As mentioned in
  that bug, some single-precision instructions generate the exception
  (while they should not), which is incorrect but does not typically
  produce an incorrect output. What is more of an issue is that several
  double-precision and vector instructions do not generate the exception
  (while they should), and this breaks support for lazy FPU/vector
  context switching in Linux (for example).

  The upper 32-bit of the double-precision/vector registers (which are
  in fact hidden in the general purpose registers) is not properly
  saved/restored, and this causes arithmetic errors. This was observed
  very frequently on a commercial project that does a lot of double-
  precision computations. The application works perfectly fine on an
  MPC8548 CPU, but fails often with QEMU.

  This is only an issue with full platform emulation - the SPE/Embedded
  Floating-Point Unavailable interrupt is not relevant for application
  emulation.

  The issue can be reproduced using the attached Linux program "spe-
  bug.c". This program properly prints the number 42 (as the result of
  some very simple double-precision computation) on real PowerPC
  hardware, but prints an incorrect result (typically 0) on QEMU.

  This issue was first discovered in an older version of QEMU, but is
  also reproduced in the latest:

  # git rev-parse HEAD
  7adfbea8fd1efce36019a0c2f198ca73be9d3f18
  # ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc --version
  QEMU emulator version 5.0.91 (v5.1.0-rc1-28-g7adfbea8fd-dirty)

  Upon further analysis a total of 39 instructions are misbehaving:

  efsabs: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efsnabs: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efsneg: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efdcfs: raised: 0, expected: 1

  evfsctui: raised: 0, expected: 1
  evfsctuiz: raised: 0, expected: 1
  brinc: raised: 0, expected: 1
  efsadd: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efsdiv: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efsmul: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efssub: raised: 1, expected: 0
  evsplatfi: raised: 0, expected: 1
  evsplati: raised: 0, expected: 1
  efscmpeq: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efscmpgt: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efscmplt: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efststeq: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efststgt: raised: 1, expected: 0
  efststlt: raised: 1, expected: 0
  evsel: raised: 0, expected: 1

  When "raised" is 0 and "expected" is 1, this means that the SPE/Embedded =
Floating-Point Unavailable interrupt was not generated while it should have.
  When "raised" is 1 and "expected" is 0, this means that the SPE/Embedded =
Floating-Point Unavailable interrupt was generated while it should not have=
 (Bug #1611394).

  A comprehensive program testing all the instructions listed in the
  Signal Processing Engine (SPE) Programming Environments Manual, Rev. 0
  is posted in the comments of this ticket, and can be used to reproduce
  the issue, and validate the future fix.
