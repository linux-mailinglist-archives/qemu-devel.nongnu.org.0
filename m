Yes, that's right.

In this case, the hard interrupt is actually a guest external interrupt
which is tracked via hgeip CSR. The hgeip CSR is updated immediately
but `riscv_cpu_local_irq_pending()` might be called while V=0 hence
no interrupt.

Here, hgeip CSR will be set and it will be reflected in mip.VSEIP
bit only when hypervisor schedules/runs the Guest (i.e. V=1 and
hstatus.VGEIN pointing to the appropriate bit of hgeip csr).

This certainly is not a bug with Guest or Hypervisor but rather an
issue of invoking `riscv_cpu_exec_interrupt()` and
`riscv_cpu_local_irq_pending()` at the right time.

Your suggestion of checking and triggering guest external interrupt
in `riscv_cpu_swap_hypervisor_regs()` is a better approach. If you
are okay then I will update this patch in the next revision.
