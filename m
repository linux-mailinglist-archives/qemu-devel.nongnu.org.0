So if I understand we now head towards introducing new notifiers taking
a "SVMContext" as argument instead of an IOMMUMemoryRegion.

I think we need to be clear about how both abstractions (SVMContext and
IOMMUMemoryRegion) differ. I would also need "SVMContext" abstraction
for 2stage SMMU integration (to notify stage 1 config changes and MSI
bindings) so I would need this new object to be not too much tied to SVM
use case.

Thanks

Eric
