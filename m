Well in this case the "kernel" is Xen which helpfully comes with a
kernel compatible header that the kernel loaded understand. The blob
could be any Dom0 kernel - it just happens to be a Linux kernel in this
case.

Well it comes down to how much of a special case this is? Pretty much
all FDT (and ACPI for the matter) is basically down to the board level
models - and not all of them just the funky configurable ones. For other
board models we just expect the user to pass the FDT they got with their
kernel blob.

For modern VirtIO systems the only thing you really need to expose is
the root PCI bus because the rest of the devices are discover-able
there.

So the real question is are there any other -devices that we want to be
able to graft FDT entries on or is the generic loader enough of a
special case that we keep all the logic in there?
