Your feedback is super valuable, thanks a lot. I really appreciate it.

Good idea. I find this a little easier to understand though:

#define NPCM7XX_GCR_MIN_DRAM_SIZE   (128 * MiB)

    s->reset_intcr3 |=3D ctz64(dram_size / NPCM7XX_GCR_MIN_DRAM_SIZE) << 8;

OK, I'll add a check for this, and also explicit checks for too large
and too small. The former is currently redundant with the DRAM size
check I'm adding to npcm7xx_realize(), but I kind of like the idea of
checking for encoding limitations and addressing limitations
separately, as they may not necessarily stay the same forever.
