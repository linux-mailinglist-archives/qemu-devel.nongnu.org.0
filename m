Actually this one magically went good. I'm testing in Virtual Box as my
ARM64 host. Maybe something went wrong there. After rebooting the whole
machine today "git" works well.

Will reopen if it happens again...

Title:
  qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "git clone
  -s"

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I want to use qemu-arm-static to cross-compile software. The compiler
  itself is a native cross-compiler connected via "distcc".

  The problem is that a script tries to do some stuff with "git" and
  with a "git clone -s" command the whole story reproducibly stops with
  a "segmentation fault".

  I don't know how to properly debug the issue but it happens 100% of
  the time that I get the "crash" or git just hangs forever with 100%
  CPU usage.
