Because there's no way to fail in vhost_region_add_section other than to
abort;

            if (mrs_gpa < prev_gpa_start) {
                error_report("%s:Section rounded to %"PRIx64
                             " prior to previous %"PRIx64,
                             __func__, mrs_gpa, prev_gpa_start);
                /* A way to cleanly fail here would be better */
                return;
            }

Oh, if it's actually memory from main RAM, then sure, but I guess you'd
have to reserve that somehow to stop the OS using it.
