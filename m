Yep, although in theory we also specify that iteration count, which might not
match (and it will never exactly match since it is benchmark based), thus
if user specified it, we might err out, and otherwise indeed ignore this.
This is of course very minor issue.

Yes but to be honest it is few lines of code, and gets you a better
error message in the process. I don't have a strong opinion on this though.

I am already out of this game for some time, I myself won't argue
over this interface (in addition to that that current interface is very good IMHO),
and I am just waiting for others to accept it.
