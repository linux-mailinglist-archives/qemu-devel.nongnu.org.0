Are they? I reimplemented all this on top of my (internal) testing
framework and use blocking FDs there, and had no issues whatsoever.

I have no idea, it'd be strange though, what would even get to the FD?

It's needed to handle different clients / connections.

For example, consider this flow

VM           net device & simtime
  <-------------- VHOST_USER_SLAVE_CALL_VRING
  --------------> request for time handling
  <-------------- response for time handling
  --------------> REPLY_ACK for VHOST_USER_SLAVE_CALL_VRING

I sort of solved it with different threads for the different entities
(netdev & simtime) but that also just causes deadlocks with the locking
that needs to happen.

Like I said, I had reimplemented this in the meantime with a (hand-
written) recursive mainloop as a single thread, and it works way better.
One of these days I need to sit down and port that to be independent of
my testing framework, so I can show the code ...
