Subject of debate...

- Some people really hate obvious docstring comments.
- Some people really like the consistency.

Which type of developer am I? Guess it depends on when you ask.

Figured we'd hash that out when I go to write a style guide document.

Yeah, it's not necessary to test the syntax of what else I've written 
with sphinx, so I didn't add it. VERY TECHNICALLY this blurb isn't 
required at all and could be deleted. You can do so if you'd like; it 
will just show up later in some other patch or series more designed to 
fix formatting.

Ideally cleaned up, but that's not a goal of this patch or series.
