That's fine; I'm hoping a qemu expert reviews as well.

$IMGFMT allows an iotest to be run on multiple formats (qcow2, qed, 
vmdk); most tests in this patch series either hard-coded the base image 
to be 'raw' (in which case I added -F raw) or to be the same type as the 
wrapper image under test (in which case it is -F $IMGFMT).  We have very 
few tests that would try to mix-and-match other formats, such as a qcow2 
on top of qed.
