Yes, this would be a new operation mode for QEMU, that only applies to
hot-plugged CPUs.  In this mode the AP doesn't reply to INIT or SMI, in
fact it doesn't reply to anything at all.

You do not need a reset vector or INIT/SIPI/SIPI sequence at all in
QEMU.  The AP does not start execution at all when it is unplugged, so
no cache-as-RAM etc.

We only need to modify QEMU so that hot-plugged APIs do not reply to
INIT/SIPI/SMI.

Why is a CPU-specific region needed if every other processor is in SMM
and thus trusted.

I can answer this: the SMM handler would interact with the hotplug
controller in the same way that ACPI DSDT does normally.  This supports
multiple hotplugs already.

Writes to the hotplug controller from outside SMM would be ignored.

The QEMU DSDT could be modified (when secure boot is in effect) to OUT
to 0xB2 when hotplug happens.  It could write a well-known value to
0xB2, to be read by an SMI handler in edk2.

Right, this would be a write to the CPU hotplug controller

See above.

See above.

So in our case we'd need an INIT/SIPI/SIPI sequence between (06) and (07).

I'd rather avoid this and stay as close as possible to real hardware.
