How to best alert the layers above QEMU was one of the topic of the KVM
Forum 2018 BoF on deprecating stuff.  Minutes:

    Message-ID: <87mur0ls8o.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>
    https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-10/msg05828.html

Relevant part:

* We need to communicate "you're using something that is deprecated".
  How?  Right now, we print a deprecation message.  Okay when humans use
  QEMU directly in a shell.  However, when QEMU sits at the bottom of a
  software stack, the message will likely end up in a log file that is
  effectively write-only.
 
  - The one way to get people read log files is crashing their
    application.  A command line option --future could make QEMU crash
    right after printing a deprecation message.  This could help with
    finding use of deprecated features in a testing environment.

  - A less destructive way to grab people's attention is to make things
    run really, really slow: have QEMU go to sleep for a while after
    printing a deprecation message.
    
  - We can also pass the buck to the next layer up: emit a QMP event.

    Sadly, by the time the next layer connects to QMP, plenty of stuff
    already happened.  We'd have to buffer deprecation events somehow.

    What would libvirt do with such an event?  Log it, taint the domain,
    emit a (libvirt) event to pass it on to the next layer up.

  - A completely different idea is to have a configuratin linter.  To
    support doing this at the libvirt level, QEMU could expose "is
    deprecated" in interface introspection.  Feels feasible for QMP,
    where we already have sufficiently expressive introspection.  For
    CLI, we'd first have to provide that (but we want that anyway).

  - We might also want to dispay deprecation messages in QEMU's GUI
    somehow, or on serial consoles.
