No, you have a point - once again I let my thoughts be carried away by the idea
of heterogeneous setups, which is a discussion for another time anyway, I was
just thinking out loud.

Yes, more specifically, in the prepare phase of migration, we'd retrieve the
string (potentially reporting an error like: "Failed to query migration
support: <errno translation>"), put the string into the migration cookie and
do the check with write on destination. The only thing is that if the error is
on the destination, the error message in kernel log lives only on the
destination, which doesn't help libvirt users, so it would require setting up
remote logging, but for layered products, this is not a problem since those
already utilize central logging nodes.

Then there are the libvirt-specific bits out of scope of this discussion,
whether we should only assume identical mdev type pairs, or whether we should
employ best effort approach and iterate over all the available types exposed by
the vendor and check whether any of the types would support this migration
(back to your note Connie, partitioning would come into the picture here).

I'd leave anything beyond returning -1 on read/write from/to the sysfs to the
vendor driver, as user space has no control over it, even if there was a
facility to interpret different return codes for us, I'm not sure (in this
migration-related case) how much would userspace be able to recover or
fallback anyway, you either can or cannot migrate smoothely.

Erik
