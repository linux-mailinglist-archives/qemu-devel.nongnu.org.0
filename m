Yes they can run as root. I can tell you what we plan to do with the
containerized virtiofsd: We run it as part of the user-owned pod (a set of
containers).
One of our main goals at the moment is to run VMs in a user-owned pod
without additional privileges.
So that in case the user (VM-creator/owner) enters the pod or something
breaks out of the VM they are just in the unprivileged container sandbox.
As part of that we try to get also rid of running containers in the
user-context with the root user.

One possible scenario which I could think of as being desirable from a
kubevirt perspective:
We would run the VM in one container and have an unprivileged
virtiofsd container in parallel.
This container already has its own mount namespace and it is not that
critical if something manages to enter this sandbox.

But we are not as far yet as getting completely rid of root right now in
kubevirt, so if as a temporary step it needs root, the current proposed
changes would still be very useful for us.

Best Regards,
Roman

There are few hurdles though.
