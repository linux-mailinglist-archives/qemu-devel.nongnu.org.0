Please don't.

These programs are examples to help people understand how the ivhsmem
device works.  They might even be useful for debugging.  They are *not*
to be used in production.

docs/specs/ivshmem-spec.txt:

    Example server code is in contrib/ivshmem-server/.  Not to be used in
    production.  It assumes all clients use the same number of interrupt
    vectors.

    A standalone client is in contrib/ivshmem-client/.  It can be useful
    for debugging.

Installing example *source* might make sense (but I doubt it).
Installing the binaries does not.
