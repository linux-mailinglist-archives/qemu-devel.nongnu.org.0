For a device that doesn't do bypass by default, the driver wouldn't have
the ability to enable bypass (feature bit not offered, not negotiable).

Let's keep the bypass feature bit for this. If the bit is offered, the
driver chooses to enable or disable it. If the bit is not offered or not
negotiated, then the behavior is deny. If the bit is offered and
negotiated then the behavior is allow.

We can say that before features negotiation (latched at features register
write, I think, in practice?) the behavior is platform dependent. The
current wording about bypass intends to discourage unsafe choices but
makes a strong statement only about the device behavior after features
negotiation. 

We could add a second feature bit specifically for the boot bypass
behavior. It wouldn't be useful to the OS (the driver doesn't have a
choice) but could present a bit in config space that allows a firmware to
disable boot-bypass in a way that is sticky across reset. So when the OS
resets the device after taking it over, it doesn't accidentally enable
bypass. I wouldn't bother though. If a FW/bootloader is able to support
virtio-iommu, the user might as well instantiate the device with the
default-deny option.

Thanks,
Jean
