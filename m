"They'll violate the license anyway" is not a compelling argument.

You need to distinguish between GPLv2-only and GPLv2-or-later.

GPLv2-or-later is fine as that upgrades to GPLv3 when used in a
combined work with Apache License or GPLv3 software.

GPLv2-only will, by design, *not* upgrade to newer GPL versions
when combined - it is simply license incompatible.

QEMU unfortunately has a bunch a GPLv2-only code present that we
cannot eliminate.

Daniel
