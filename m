Thank you, Daniel.  More on it below.

I still like that idea.  We can explore a 100% QAPIfied CLI there with
minimal disruption elsewhere, and without CLI compatibility concerns.
Constraints due to the shared QAPI schema remain, unless we freely
duplicate stuff, which would probably be a bad idea.

These are the known "cheats" in QMP.  There's also netdev_add, but Eric
has patches to QAPIfy it properly.  Eric, I hope you can dust them off.

For CLI, we have numerous options to QAPIfy.  Some of them are trivial.
Others involve QAPIfying substantial code behind them: I don't want a
QAPIfied option to immediately stuff everything into QemuOpts for
outmoded internal interfaces.  Such shortcuts is what got us into the
netdev_add mess.

QAPIfying internal interfaces is one of the areas where we QAPI guys
will need help.

Weird semantics can also get in the way.  For instance, when we replaced
-drive with -blockdev, we used the opportunity to ditch block backend
auto-deletion.
