Per the discussions in the related Forum postings about CI limites, the
400 minute limit is still only intended to apply to projects that are
marked as private.  Public projects are not even being tracked for
accounting, let alone have a limit enforced. They also said they want
to make sure they don't impact ability of users to contribute to OSS
projects hosted on GitLab that require use of CI.

It feels like what you hit here is fallout from your account accidentally
getting blocked, rather than something which is hitting every contributor
to QEMU. Did they restore projects as private perhaps ?

Daniel
