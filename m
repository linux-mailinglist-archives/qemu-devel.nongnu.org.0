Well, not usually.  Petitboot parses grub configuration itself, which
means that generally from the OS / installer point of view it looks
like grub, even though it's not from the actual bootstrapping point of
view.

So, as actual OF implementations go, SLOF is already pretty minimal
(hence "Slim Line Open Firmware").  If there's no Forth, it's really
not OF any more, just something mimicing some of OF's interfaces.

But the difficulty of SLOF isn't really its bigness or slowness in any
case (the slowness is just an additional irritation).  The two big
issues are 1) that it's written in an obscure language and 2)
synchronizing its state with things that require host side
involvement.

Rewriting a minimal guest side not-OF would partly address (1) (but
there's still the logistical pain of having to build and insert it),
and wouldn't address (2) at all.
