Well, only after patches 1-6 (prior to then, it was also set in protocol 
drivers).  I think you might be able to hoist part of this patch earlier 
in the series, to make the changes to the protocol drivers easier to 
review, by rewording this sentence:

Currently, the only format drivers that set this field are qed and qcow2.

You can't delete this field until all protocol drivers are cleaned up, 
so deferring this part of the change to the end of the series makes sense.

Doing this cleanup makes sense: there is only one caller of this 
function pre-patch, and 0 callers post-patch - but whether the cleanup 
should be at the same time as you fix the one caller, or deferred to 
when you also clean up the field, is less important.

If I were writing the series:

1 - fix qemu-img.c to not use the field
2 - fix block_status to not use the function
3-n - fix protocol drivers that set the field to also return _ZERO
  during block status (but not delete the field at that time)
n+1 - delete unused function and field (from ALL drivers)

Does the driver actually have to do the zeroing?  Looking at qcow2.c, I see:
static coroutine_fn int qcow2_co_preadv_task(BlockDriverState *bs,
...

     case QCOW2_CLUSTER_UNALLOCATED:
         assert(bs->backing); /* otherwise handled in 
qcow2_co_preadv_part */

         BLKDBG_EVENT(bs->file, BLKDBG_READ_BACKING_AIO);
         return bdrv_co_preadv_part(bs->backing, offset, bytes,
                                    qiov, qiov_offset, 0);

which just defers to the block layer to handle read-beyond-EOF, rather 
than an explicit memset in the driver.

So maybe you can simplify to:
- For such (unallocated) blocks, read will:
   - fill buffer with zeros if there is no backing file
   - read from the backing file otherwise, where the block layer
     takes care of reading zeros beyond EOF if backing file is short

But the effect is the same.

I like this part of the change.  But if it is done first in the series, 
it _does_ have a semantic impact on protocol drivers (previously, 
protocol drivers that return 0 but set the field 
.unallocated_blocks_are_zero will be changed to report _ZERO; after this 
patch, protocol drivers do not do that, because they don't support 
backing files, and it is now only backing files that do the _ZERO 
magic).  So doing _just_ this change, along with a better analysis of 
how it changes the semantics of 'qemu-io -c map' on protocol drivers 
while mentioning why that is okay, would make a better start to the 
series, rather than here at the end.  Of course, if you defer it to the 
end, then none of the protocol drivers set .unallocated_blocks_are_zero 
anyway, but that cost more review work on each altered protocol driver.
