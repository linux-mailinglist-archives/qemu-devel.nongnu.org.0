Right, if you have the QEMU bluetooth code in use somehow, please
provide more details how you're using it (i.e. the QEMU command line
etc.). Otherwise, be assured that the current bluetooth code won't be of
any help for your topic, since it is likely completely broken. You then
better pass-through a dedicated USB bluetooth adapter from your host to
your instead, or simply use emulated USB mouse and keyboard with your
macOS guest.
