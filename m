I agree with all your points and would like to do better in this area.  Other than hunting for 
every use of a descriptor and either supporting it or blocking cpr, do you have any suggestions?
Thinking out loud, maybe we can gather all the fds that we support, then look for all fds in the
process, and block the cpr if we find an unrecognized fd.
