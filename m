Hmm. OK, I don't know. Probably it's not a big difference: use CAF vs
move filters to backing child. And anyway we may move them later.
Probably it's simpler to fix all the issues, if move the filters to
backing child first, but we already have you series and rebasing it
on another concept is an extra work, not worth doing.
