Hint: WBNOINVD uses a previously ignored prefix, i.e. it looks a *lot*
      like WBINVD...

Agreed.  To play nice with live migration, KVM should enumerate WBNOINVD
regardless of host support.  Since WBNOINVD uses an ignored prefix, it
will simply look like a regular WBINVD on platforms without WBNOINVD.

Let's assume the WBNOINVD VM-Exit behavior is sane, i.e. allows software
to easily differentiate between WBINVD and WBNOINVD.  In that case, the
value added would be that KVM can do WBNOINVD instead of WBINVD in the
unlikely event that (a) KVM needs to executed WBINVD on behalf of the
guest (because the guest has non-coherent DMA), (b) WBNOINVD is supported
on the host, and (c) WBNOINVD is used by the guest (I don't think it would
be safe to assume that the guest doesn't need the caches invalidated on
WBINVD).
