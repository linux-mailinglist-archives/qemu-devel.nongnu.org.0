I looked through the 2020, 2019, and 2018 git log for checkpatch.pl and
found few commits that were directly applied from Linux. Some were
rewritten from scratch for QEMU and inspired by Linux commits. In
practice QEMU maintains a fork rather than a mirror of checkpatch.pl.

Let's encourage improvements to checkpatch.pl, even if that means
diverging further from Linux, because it's a valuable tool for improving
coding style, quality, etc. If there is a feeling that changes to
checkpatch.pl are discouraged there will be more coding style
inconsistencies, reviewers will have to point out trivial issues
manually, etc because we're afraid to touch the script.
