I don't think we do explicit pinning of migration related threads right
now, which means they'll inherit characteristics of whichever thread
spawns the transient migration thread.  If the mgmt app has pinned the
emulator threads to a single CPU, then creating many migration threads
is a waste of time as they'll compete with each other.

I woudn't be needed to create migration threads at startup - we should
just think about how we would identify and control them when created
at runtime. The complexity here is a trust issue - once guest code has
been run, we can't trust what QMP tells us - so I'm not sure how we
would learn what PIDs are associated with the transiently created
migration threads, in order to set their properties.

Daniel
