This approach doesn't look right to me. BlockdevCreateOptions should
describe the state of the image after the operation. You're describing
an update instead (and in a way that doesn't allow you to change
everything that you may want to change, so that you need to call the
operation multiple times).

I imagined the syntax of a blockdev-amend QMP command similar to
x-blockdev-reopen: Describe the full set of options that you want to
have in effect after the operation; if you don't want to change some
option, you just specify it again with its old value.

Specifically for luks, this probably means that you have a @slots, which
is a list that contains at least the secret for each slot, or JSON null
for a slot that should be left empty.

With the same approach, you don't have to make 'size' optional in later
patches, you can just require that the current size is re-specified. And
later, blockdev-amend could actually allow changing the size of images
if you provide a different value.
