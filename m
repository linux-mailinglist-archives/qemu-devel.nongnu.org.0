You need doc strings for help, but not for completion.

query-qmp-schema's reply is already rather big: 130KiB.

The size of docs in an JSON encoding useful to qmp-shell we can only
estimate.  Plain text docs/interop/qemu-qmp-ref.txt is 505KiB.

I guess we'd make the doc strings optional.

qmp-shell tries to improve on the JSON syntax by inventing its own,
but...

... it does a halfhearted job.

I'm deeply skeptical of any solution that starts with inventing a
new language.  Start with examining existing ones instead.

We discussed relaxing the rules for such QMP commands.  In particular,
they could return just a string.  Fine with me as long as we make
perfectly clear these commands are not stable interfaces.

We can't possibly be the first ones asking this question.
