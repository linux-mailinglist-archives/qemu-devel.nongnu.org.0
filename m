Or we could think of "zerocopy"  in a more targetted way.
It is only "zerocopy" in terms the final I/O operation.
Earlier parts of the process may involve copies. IOW, we
can copy as part of the compress operation, but skip the
when then sending the compressed page.

In practice though this is still unlikely to be something
we can practically do, as we would need to keep compressed
pages around for an entire migration iteration until we can
call flush to ensure the data has been sent. This would be
significant memory burden.
