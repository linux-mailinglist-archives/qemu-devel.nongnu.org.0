ENOENT would be IMO a good heuristic for silence, as I see no point in
warning that something won't be cleaned up if it's already gone from
POV of QEMU.

Iff, I'd then personally only log at some level that shows up on
debug/high-verbosity settings, that should cover the a bit odd setups where,
e.g. the PID file is there but not visible to QEMU, e.g., because being
located in another mount namespace (in which case the management stack that
put it there probably wants to handle that more explicitly anyway). Or do
you meant something else with "not accurate in all cases"?

best regards,
Thomas
