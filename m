+linux-riscv, as this may very well be a kernel bug

I seem to remember ASID 0 being a special one, with some global-ness, 
but I couldn't find that in a quick poke into the spec.  As below, I'm 
going to read through this a bit more...

(Also, I haven't had any coffee yet)

If it's a kernel bug we should fix it, but I'm not entirely convinced 
that's the case.  I can confirm that the following makes Linux boot 
again

diff --git a/arch/riscv/kernel/head.S b/arch/riscv/kernel/head.S

It's been a while since I read through the rules here so I'm going to go 
read them again, but IIRC that shouldn't be necessary: that first 
sfence.vma should be sufficiently global to ensure all prior writes to 
the page tables are visible, regardless of what's in SATP.  That said, I 
remember there being a lot of subtly here in the spec wording so I'm 
going to go read the spec again.

>> 2. Restore the patch

Presumably you mean "revert" here?  That might be the right way to go, 
just to avoid breaking users (even if we fix the kernel bug, it'll take 
a while to get everyone to update).  That said, this smells like the 
sort of thing that's going to crop up at arbitrary times in dynamic 
systems so while a revert looks like it'd work around the boot issue we 
might be making more headaches for folks down the road.

IIUC the sfence.vma before the SATP write is very explicitly necessary: 
without that fence old mappings could be utilized directly after the 
SATP write, so we might not even be able to fetch the next instruction.

The ISA manual is quite explicit about SATP not enforcing these 
orderings.  If what I remember about ASID 0 is true then I do think we'd 
need one, though, to avoid the aliasing -- hopefully I'll make a bit 
more sense soon, though...
