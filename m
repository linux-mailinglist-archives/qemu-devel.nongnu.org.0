I think this abstract language is QAPI. The problem is that we're not
even close to using QAPI for everything. Adding a new language on top of
QAPI instead isn't going to make the conversion process any faster.

BlockdevOptions in the QAPI schema is what tells you how it _really_
works. The connection to the various command line syntaxes isn't defined
in a declarative way because we don't have a QAPIfied command line yet.
I know that Markus wants to work on this, but I don't know how much time
he actually has to invest in it.

I would say two different ways because drive_add() is just a small
wrapper around drive_def() that overrides a few options.

Describing the semantics of the -drive way is hard. This is one of the
reasons why I would love to get rid of it and replace it with a new
user-friendly option that has a more direct mapping to the -blockdev
way, which in turn just is BlockdevOptions mapped 1:1 to the command
line.

I think adding an output for additional languages to the QAPI generator
shouldn't be too hard. It already creates multiple things from a single
schema (C data structures and command wrappers, schema introspection
data, documentation, and probably other things that I forgot).

libvirt already speaks QAPI, however without reusing the schema and the
generator from QEMU.

Indeed, this is the major reason why QAPI isn't as pervasive as it
should be.

I think the only thing in this list that can't obviously be covered
easily by QAPI is QOM. Or rather, it's covered by passing through
key=3Dvalue lists without describing their structure - which, as far as I
understand, is mainly because QOM properties aren't necessarily static,
so we can't provide a statically defined interface for them. Probably
solvable in QEMU, but not without a major effort. In a fork that doesn't
care about compatibility, it should be easier.

I don't think user-friendly shortcuts on the command line are "most
fundamental". Whether to accept -blo is an implementation detail of the
command line parser which translates a bunch of strings into QAPI
objects.

This sounds like a different approach from our current QAPI command set
(use a smaller set of operations that can work with a greater variety of
objects).

Does it actually provide more functionality, though?
