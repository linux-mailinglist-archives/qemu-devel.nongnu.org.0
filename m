Hi Peter,

I think you should quote the commit that changes the behavior:
654f1f13ea56  kvm: Check irqchip mode before assign irqfd?
so that one can understand what it fixed.

So on kernels that do not feature that commit, the ioctl succeeds and we
pretend the resamplefd was properly attached whereas in practice it was
never triggered.

Thanks

Eric
