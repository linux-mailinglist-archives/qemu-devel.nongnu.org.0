Ok.  Note that the qemu emulated machine doesn't model the hardware
right down to the level of hostboot.  That's wy we're just loading
skiboot and jumping straight into it usually.  I guess clg's stuff to
load pnor images gets us a little closer to the hardware behaviour,
but I think it's still only a rough approximation.
