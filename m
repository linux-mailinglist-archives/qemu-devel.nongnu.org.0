This is an invalid case where behaviour will be undefined anyway so 
returning anything such as 0 or -1 is probably OK (what do most hardware 
return in this case?). If callers need better error handling they can do a 
check before calling the function but for other (most) callers which will 
just return the same random value you would return from 
pci_default_read_config() having an assert instead makes it necessary to 
modify all of them one by one and doubles the check overhead by 
unnecessarily double checking. So I think having a default check and error 
handling in pci_default_read_config() would be better so callers who don't 
care would work and those few who might care could check before calling or 
actually implement their own callback (which I expect they already do as 
this is just the default implementation of this callback).
