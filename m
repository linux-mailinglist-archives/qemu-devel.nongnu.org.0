I think the existing code also does the same:
kvm_arm_vgic_probe() gets called as soon as vms->gic_version <= 0 &&
kvm_enabled() whatever the state of kvm_irqchip_in_kernel().

So in case the host only supports GICv2, in kvm mode with userspace
irqchip we would use GICV2 in host/max mode. If host supports GICv3 we
would select GICv3 which is not supported in !kvm_irqchip_in_kernel().

So do I understand correctly that you want me to change that behavior
and always set v2 in KVM/!kvm_irqchip_in_kernel() max/host mode?

Thanks

Eric
