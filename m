My problem is I can see a whole bunch of places that reusing the
original argv breaks, so I don't think this is a useful general
solution:

   a) The -incoming example
   b) The management app has to reply the hotplug sequence
   c) ...even if it did there's no guarantee that the original
pre-hotplug commandline works:
      i) e.g. an original block device file was deleted
     ii) One of the endpoints for a network device is gone.

  Any part of (c) could cause the exec'd qemu to fail before
it gets as far as allowing you to issue the hotplug commands.
It's also plain dangerous, since the exec'd qemu shouldn't be accessing
a  file or device that has been hot-unplugged and might now be part of
a different VM.

So I think you really should pass another command line option here
rather than setting an environment variable; and then I think you should
consider two separate things:

  a) You could easily strip out options of the form --cpr-freeze
  b) Consider something more general; e.g. allow the management layer to
specify a new set of argv to be used by the exec.
