Maybe that means we need '*name':'t' to expand into something longer, maybe
  'name':{'type':'t', 'optional':true}
which in  turn would be synonymous with your idea of ALL types accepting=20
a default of null:
  'name':{'type':'t', 'optional':true, 'default':null}

At any rate, your counterpoint is taken - whatever we pick, we'll want=20
to make sure that introspection can expose semantics, and whether we can=20
make '*' redundant with some other form of longhand in the qapi language=20
is in part determined by whether we also reflect that through=20
introspection.  If that means that keeping '*' in the longhand form of=20
optional members (whether or not those members have a default value),=20
then so be it.
