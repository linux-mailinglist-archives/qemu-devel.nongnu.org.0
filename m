Never mind, the problem was not in the jump2ipl.c code, but in the
pxe-test: The code only worked if the r3 register contained only zeroes
in the upper bits. The changes to jump2ipl.c here caused the compiler to
put a different value in r3, so the test suddenly crashed. I've now sent
a patch to fix the test ("tests/boot-sector: Fix the bad s390x assembler
code").
