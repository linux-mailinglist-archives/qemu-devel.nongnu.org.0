AVR is the name of a microcontroller lineup, and Atmel is the name of the
company that started producing them. Atmel was recently acquired by
Microchip, so thw word Atmel now does not even exist in new specs.

Taking this into account, I don't think renaming

hw/char/avr_usart.c -> hw/char/atmel_usart.c

is not appropriate. Renaming macros, too. The current names are fine, for
now.

A separate but related naming question will show up later in future, when
we, let's say, want to implement two different version of a peripheral
(let's say USART), one as specified for older microcontrollers, and one for
newer.

But, OK, let's leave that for future.

Regards,
Aleksandar

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 expected to be o sort of &quot;su=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 you solve<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 that problem? Right now, it may n=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 but if you<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 don;t think about that right now,=
 from the outset, soon the<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 fix it.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Please think about that, how woul=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 pass the information on the curre=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 covering a peripheral, and provid=

<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Hi Aleksandar,<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Please explain.<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 My concern is about peripherals inside the chip, together wit=
h the core.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 If one models, let&#39;s say an external (in the sense, it is=
 a separate<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 chip) ADC (analog-to-digital converter), one looks at specs,<=
br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 implement what is resonable possible in QEMU, plug it in in o=
ne of<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 machines thst contains it, and that&#39;s it. That ADC remain=
s the same,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 of course, whatever the surrounding system is.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 In AVR case, I think we have a phenomenon likes of which we d=
idn&#39;t<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 see before (at least I don&#39;t know about). Number of AVR<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 microcontrollers is very large, and both cores and peripheral=
s evolved.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 For cores, you handle differences with all these AVR_FEATURE =
macros,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 and this seems to be working, no significant objection from m=
y side,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 and btw that was not an easy task to execute, all admiration =
from me.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 But what about peripherals inside the chip? A peripheral with=
 the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 same name and the same general area of functionality may be<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 differently specified for microcontrollers from 2010 and 2018=
. By<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the difference I don&#39;t mean starting address, but the dif=
ference in<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 behavior. I don&#39;t have time right now to spell many examp=
les, but I<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 read three different specs, and there are differences in USAR=
T<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 specifications.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I am not clear what is your envisioned solution for these cas=
es.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Would you such close, but not the same, flabors of a peripher=
al<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 treat as if they are two completely separate cases of a perip=
heral?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Or would you have a single peripheral that would somehow conf=
igure<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 itself depending on the core it is attached to?<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I hope I was clearer this time.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Aleksandar<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I don&#39;t see any problem from CPU&#39;s pers=
pective.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 as for the sample board is just a sample, I hop=
e other people<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 will create real models or real hw.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 there was no way I could provide a CPU alone, t=
hat&#39;s why there<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 is sample.<br>

<br>
If I understand Aleksandar correctly, the naming is incorrect because too g=
eneric to AVR family, why Sarah only modeled the Atmel implementation.<br>
<br>
Renaming devices such hw/char/avr_usart.c -&gt; hw/char/atmel_usart.c (simi=
larly with the macros) would be enough Aleksandar?<br>
<br>
</blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Some renaming could help, p=
erhaps not quite like the one above, but my point (which I find hard to bel=
ieve I can&#39;t explain to you) is that peripherals inside the chip evolve=

ne...</div>
