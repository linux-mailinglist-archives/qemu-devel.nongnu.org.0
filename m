Many old DT bindings are incomplete.

The main motivation behind the conversion from plain text to yaml is to
do automatic validation of DTS files, based on the bindings.  During the
conversion process, many issues are detected, and fixed; not only in the
DTS files, but also in the bindings (e.g. missing properties, like in
this case).

When running the validation on a device tree passed to the guest
(extracted from /sys/firmware/devicetree/base, converted to dts, and
 manually fixed up the phandles), the following is reported about the
pl061 node:

    virt.dt.yaml: pl061@9030000: {'reg': [[0, 151191552, 0, 4096]],
'gpio-controller': True, 'phandle': [[32771]], '#gpio-cells': [[2]],
'clocks': [[32768]], '#interrupt-cells': [[2]], 'compatible':
['arm,pl061', 'arm,primecell'], 'clock-names': ['apb_pclk'],
'$nodename': ['pl061@9030000']} is not valid under any of the given
schemas
    [...]
            virt.dt.yaml: pl061@9030000: 'interrupts' is a required property

    virt.dt.yaml: pl061@9030000: $nodename:0: 'pl061@9030000' does not
match '^gpio@[0-9a-f]+$'
    virt.dt.yaml: pl061@9030000: 'interrupt-controller' is a required property

PL061 is an interrupt controller, as it can assert its interrupt output
based on activity on GPIO input lines.

It means that other devices that have their interrupt output connected
to a PL061 GPIO input won't work, as their driver in the guest OS cannot
find the interrupt.  Note that arm/virt.c currently doesn't instantiate
such devices.

Matching is indeed done based on compatible value.

For node names, please see
https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification/releases/tag/v0.3

   "2.2.2 Generic Names Recommendation

    The name of a node should be somewhat generic, reflecting the
    function of the device and not its precise programming model. If
    appropriate, the name should be one of the following choices:

    [...]

    - gpio

    [...]"

While many new generic names have been added recently, "gpio" was
already documented in the Power.orgTM Standard for Embedded Power
ArchitectureTM Platform Requirements (ePAPR).

I hope the above explains the rationale behind these change better.
Thanks!
