We have a few more ideas on how to make this a bit cleaner.

We could create a new class "ConsoleSocket", based on asyncore.dispatcher.
The asyncore python library allows for overriding certain functionality of
an underlying socket.
We could override the handle_read() method in order to get a callback
when data is available to be read from the console.  This is much cleaner
than us simply waiting with a read() on the socket in a thread.
Note that even asyncore requires a thread around asyncore.loop(), but we wo=
uld
only be responsible for start/stop of the thread and the thread body
is defined for us (literally just asyncore.loop()).
The thread starting/stopping would be completely transparent
to the users of this new ConsoleSocket.  The thread would be created on
initialization of ConsoleSocket, and destroyed upon close() of the socket.

As the console bytes get consumed we can dump them to an in memory stream,
rather than dumping them to a file right away.
We could perhaps use an io.StringIO text stream.  This stream will get
the bytes of the console and the test will consume the bytes directly
from this stream.
In addition, we could optionally dump the bytes to a file as well.

How does this sound?  Just looking for a bit of feedback before we
head in this direction.

Thanks & Regards,
