This follows the previous series which adds the 'bitmap' sync mode
and uses it to add interactions with bitmaps to the 'full' and 'top'
modes to blockdev-backup and drive-backup.

Why?
 on-success: Can conveniently synchronize a bitmap to a full backup.
             Allows for transactionless anchor backups.
             Allows us to attempt an anchor backup without damaging
               our bitmap until the backup is successful.
             Allows for transactional, ungrouped anchor backups.
 always: Allows us to resume full/top style backups with a later
         invocation to sync=3Dbitmap. Neat!

Summary:
1-3: Refactor iotest 257 to accommodate this;
4-5: Augment 257 to test trivial failure cases
6-9: Refactor sync=3Dtop for block/backup
10: Implement feature
11: Test feature

001: Fallout from changing floor(x / y) to x // y.
     Fallout from changing x =3D x | y to x |=3D y.
     (Decided not to keep RB.)
002: Removed dead variable
     Change x =3D x - y to x -=3D y in clear_bits()
003: Substantially reorganize patch. Hopefully 10% more clever and 10% le=
ss cute.
004: (Added RB.)
005: Added docstring to test_backup_api
     Fixed test matrix enumeration to have consistent order in python2/3
     (Declined RB.)
---: What was patch 006 was dropped, and became patches 6-9.
6-9: New!
010: Was 007;
     Formatting fix.
     (Added RB.)
011: Was 008;
     Adjust bitmap clearing/expected code as a consequence of #9.
     Fallout from changes to 005.
