Having to extract the name out of a log file is not machine-friendly.
Should we have some query-audio command?

How would I identify which of the possibly several names belongs to the
thing I set up via QMP?

Okay, I understand specifying here what JACK does makes no sense.  But
let's try to phrase what we can specify as clearly as possible.
