Are you talking about:

  #define ARM_CPU_FREQ 1000000000 /* FIXME: 1 GHz, should be configurable */

because as far as I can tell that only affects the scaling factors
applied to PMU counters. The internal counters (CNTFRQ_EL0 and friends)
are hardwired to:

   /* Scale factor for generic timers, ie number of ns per tick.
    * This gives a 62.5MHz timer.
    */
   #define GTIMER_SCALE 16

but this only affects the nominal rate the counters expire at. Software
could attempt to reprogram it and the emulation will read-as-written but
it won't actually change anything. However this only affects the clocks
- it implies nothing about how fast the core may be executing. In fact
unless you are using icount we will just run as fast a possible.

You need to be a little more precise here. ARM systems vary in the
number of timer sources they have. The qemu timers are an internal
implementation detail for providing a way to track time. The value of
SYSCLK_FRQ varies depending on what board you have launched and mostly
seems to be used to calculate the additional timer values for various
peripherals.

All icount does is peg the elapsed virtual time to the number of
instructions executed (the instruction count). This means whenever the
code requests:

  qemu_clock_get_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL)

Instead of returning the number of ns the guest has been running based
on elapsed host time it will return the number of instructions run
shifted by icount_shift. So with higher shift values each instruction
sees an increased amount of virtual time pass - the practical effect
will be you see less instructions executed between timer interrupts.

  $QEMU $QEMU_ARGS -icount N

or

  $QEMU $QEMU_ARGS -icount shift=3DN

What is your interest in icount? Is it purely for determinism?
