For COLO I really expect it for the migration stream, the disk mirroring
stream and probably the network comparison/forwarding streams.

I feel it might be nice not to have to create so many separate knobs.

I wonder if a different way would be to make all network connections
register with yank, but then make yank take a list of connections to
shutdown(2).
