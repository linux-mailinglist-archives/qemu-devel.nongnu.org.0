From further off-list discussion with David, I have learned that
recent Fedora images include an OpenSBI build with embedded U-Boot
payload, such that you only need to have that single file on the host
and pass it to QEMU via -kernel[1] for RISC-V guest boot to work. I
played with it over the past few days, and it works very nicely.

I think this is the result that we want to ultimately reach: a single
RISC-V "firmware" binary installed on the host through an appropriate
distro package, shared among guests, with everything else that is
guest-specific being contained in the corresponding disk image.

This is what other architectures are already doing, with SeaBIOS and
OVMF on x86_64, AAVMF on aarch64 and SLOF on ppc64 all being handled
this way: RISC-V should, where it makes sense, follow suit.

QEMU also recently introduced a JSON-based specification that can be
used to advertise guest firmwares and libvirt already supports it,
which makes firmware configuration either extremely convenient or
entirely automatic for the user: the OpenSBI support should also be
advertised this way.


[1] I guess that'd be -bios after these patches?
