Yeah, I thought about this, but I decided I didn't like having
"there's a Resettable interface but you have to know that
some implementations are special and it's not possible to
do the same things with them you can with some others".
Implementing migration of the child bus reset state as part of
the parent device's vmstate is a bit tedious but not impossible.
(Basically in the parent device's pre-save function you have
to create a temporary array, populate it by walking the list
of child buses and looking at their reset flags, then migrate
the contents of the array, and in post-load you do "walk child
buses and fill in the reset flags from the array". There's a
VMSTATE_WITH_TMP macro that can apparently assist with this.)

I think that migration-during-reset should Just Work, without
necessarily needing any specific changes for a device.
I'm not sure a warning that only prints when the guest does
something to cause device-reset is going to be very helpful:
what would be the thing that the warning would tell us we needed
to do?
