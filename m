I meant that 'vmstate_pvrdma' will contain more fields later. This is

It doesn't seem like a convention, but this is how it is named
in other places in the source. But sure, I'll change it to a more
meaningful name, if it is needed.

TL;DR
The trick is on line 567 in migration/vmstate-types.c in the
function 'put_tmp'.


Each VMStateDescription has one or more VMStateField values
which are used to define members of the device state for migration.

VMSTATE_WITH_TMP is a macro which defines a VMStateField for
those types of device state which need an intermediate representation
and cannot be migrated directly. In our case, this might apply to the
dma addresses and pdir information stored within dsr.

Each VMStateField has a corresponding VMStateInfo, which basically
is an interface declaring two functions, get and put. These functions are
used to describe how this certain type of VMStateField has to be
saved/loaded during migration.

VMSTATE_WITH_TMP has its VMStateInfo set to 'vmstate_info_tmp',
which assigns the functions 'put_tmp' and 'get_tmp' for save/load logic.

Lets consider state save during migration.
All the state saving work is done inside 'vmstate_save_state_v'.
It takes a VMStateDescription as 2nd argument and an opaque type
as 3rd argument.

When 'vmstate_save_state_v' is first called during migration, the
VMStateDescription argument is set to 'vmstate_pvrdma', and
opaque is set to our instance of PVRDMADev.

This function iteratively saves the VMStateFields; PCI then MSIX
then the WITH_TMP.
When it reaches WITH_TMP, it falls through the if-else conditions,
and finally reaches field->info->put. [migration/vmstate.c:386]
This put function is set to 'put_tmp' mentioned above.

Now, the 'put_tmp' function is called, with 'pv' parameter set to the
'parent' field of PVRDMAMigTmp, and 'field' set to our WITH_TMP.
This is because 'parent' is the first member of PVRDMAMigTmp,
and both first_elem and curr_elem (inside 'vmstate_save_state_v')
will point to it when the while loop reaches WITH_TMP field.

'put_tmp' will set the first element of 'tmp' to 'pv' and call
'vmstate_save_state*' with opaque parameter set to this 'tmp', and
the VMStateDescription set to 'vmstate_pvrdma_dsr_dma'.

No, the VM on the source halts.

Yes, you are right. We do not need these 6 fields. In fact, we don't need
vmstate_pvrdma_dsr_dma and PVRDMAMigTmp as of now; we just need the
save/load logic in vmstate_pvrdma.

I had added these fields based on the BounceBuffer issue we had earlier.

There is a 'post_save' function available which is called on the src when
the fields are saved into the migration stream. We can try that.

These are used to indicate any major changes to the device state
for migration such that if versions do not match at all, migration
will fail for the device.
Removing these also does not make any difference in the behaviour
of our migration, since we are implementing it from scratch currently.
I had added these because it seemed like convention.
