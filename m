Interesting.  Thanks for digging through the other manuals.

Oh my.  Ok, well, if there's software that relies on some advance, I guess we
can conditionally do that.  It'll take a bit of work...

In

  https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1072596/

I arrange for the length of the current instruction to be stored in qemu's
exception unwind data.  Within restore_state_to_opc, the "ilen" is stored into
an existing slot in s390's env structure; you'd have to add such a slot for m68k.

Given the length of the insn currently executing, you can reliably compute the
pc of the next instruction.  Which would let you advance the pc for this case,
for the appropriate cpu type.

At minimum that's going to need

  cpu_loop_exit_restore(cs, retaddr);

But usually store some of the addr and access_type data into fields so that you
can properly fill in the exception frame later.

So, earlier, I suggested adding a call to cpu_handle_debug_exception within
cpu_handle_exception.  Did you try that?
