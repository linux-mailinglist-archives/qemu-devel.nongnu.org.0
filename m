I see your point.  I was assuming that the function pointers
would stay in cpu.c/X86CPUDefinition, then it wouldn't make sense
to copy the pointers to X86MachineClass.

If the functions are going to live in pc.c, then adding the
function pointers to X86MachineState might make sense and your
suggestion above[1] sounds reasonable.
