To just repeat the patch 5 description...

Currently meson registers a single test that invokes an entire group of
I/O tests, hiding the test granularity from meson. There are various
downsides of doing this

 * You cannot ask 'meson test' to invoke a single I/O test
 * The meson test timeout can't be applied to the individual
   tests
 * Meson only gets a pass/fail for the overall I/O test group
   not individual tests
 * If a CI job gets killed by the GitLab timeout, we don't
   get visibility into how far through the I/O tests
   execution got.

This is not really specific to the I/O tests, the problem is common
to any case of us running a test which is in fact another test
harness which runs many tests. It would be nice to have meson have
the full view of all tests run. Adapting the I/O tests is as easy
win in this respect.

This switches meson to perform test discovery by invoking 'check' in
dry-run mode. It then registers one meson test case for each I/O
test. Parallel execution remains disabled since the I/O tests do not
use self contained execution environments and thus conflict with
each other.

A few tweaks were needed to the iotests runner because it had a few
assumptions about it always running in a tree that has already been
built, which is obviously not the case at the time meson does test
discovery.

Daniel P. Berrang√© (5):
  iotests: explicitly pass source/build dir to 'check' command
  iotests: allow test discovery before building
  iotests: strip subdir path when listing tests
  iotests: print TAP protocol version when reporting tests
  iotests: register each I/O test separately with meson
