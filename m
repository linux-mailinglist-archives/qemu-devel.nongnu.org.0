The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  qemu-system-sparc64 -M sun4v aborts on tribblix-sparc-0m16.iso

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  qemu-system-sparc64 qemu-2.9.0-3.10.x86_64 on openSUSE Leap 42.3 using
  'sun4v' machine aborts with tribblix. With 2048 MB of RAM it takes
  considerably more time to abort (but the core is always truncated).
