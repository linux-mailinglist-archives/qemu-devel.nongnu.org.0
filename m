On the other hand, I'm afraid that having a functional solution won't
motivate people to come up with a new spec... Anyway, I agree that the
data corruption/loss issues must be prevented, ie, the 9p server should
at least return an error to the client rather than returning a colliding
QID. A simple way to avoid that is to enforce a single device, ie. patch
2 in Antonios's series. Of course this may break some setups where
multiple devices are involved, but it is pure luck if they aren't already
broken with the current code base. I assume that this covers most 9p users,
based on the fact that Antonios and now yourself are the only people who
ever reported this issue. Then, I'm okay if we try to cover some more
scenarios, but it must take the maintainance burden into account.

Ok. I must admit my ignorance around ZFS and "data sets"... so IIUC, even with
a single underlying physical device you might end up with lstat() returning
different st_dev values on the associated files, correct ?

I take your word for the likeliness of the issue to popup in such setups. :)

What are "native file forks" ?

It would be very much appreciated to have someone else investing time in 9p
of course. :)

I guess I was unclear... As said above, I do want to avoid QID collisions,
at least by enforcing a single device per shared path. Then, supporting
multiple devices will depend on the benefice/expense ratio.

Hmm... I was objecting on the fact that "vii" would cope with runtime
changes on the host while the guest is running.

I guess this all boils down to I finding some time to read/understand more :)

As usual, a series with smaller and simpler patches will be easier to
review, and more likely to be merged.

It seems that we may be reaching some consensus here :)

I like the approach, provided this is configurable from the command line, off
by default and doesn't duplicate core 9p code. Not sure this needs to sit in
its own C unit though.

The 9p code has a long history of CVEs and limitations that prevented it
to reach full production grade quality. Combined with the poor quality of
the code, this has scared off many experienced QEMU developpers, which
prefer to work on finding an alternative solution. Such alternative is
virtio-fs, which is being actively worked on:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-04/msg02746.html

Note: I'm not telling "stay away from 9p" but maybe worth taking a look,
      because if virtio-fs gets merged, it is likely to become the official
      and better supported way to share files between host and guest.

Please repost a series, possibly based on some of Antonios's patches that
allows to avoid the QID collision, returns an error to the client instead
and possibly printing out some useful messages in the QEMU log. Then, on
top of that, you can start introducing hashing and variable prefix length.

Cheers,
