In fact, we are not cheating that much. We use the IPMI BT interface of=20
QEMU to handle the HIOMAP communication with the BMC and this model is=20
quite precise.=20

The mapping of the PNOR is simply mapped on the LPC FW address space.=20
The underlying access are simplified because we don't have a LPC model
but we could generate all the SPI transaction using the Aspeed models.=20
I had experiments in that sense for P8.=20

I will sense the patches I have on the topic.
