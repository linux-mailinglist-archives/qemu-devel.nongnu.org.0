I see the QEMU build logs adding:

 -I/usr/local/Cellar/capstone/4.0.2/include/capstone

so  #include <capstone/capstone.h>   seems unlikely to work

Well you're proposing a change during RC time which is likely to
break builds if the assumption that its always in the system
include path is wrong. So I think the explicit compatibility is
required to reduce the risk of this creating a regression.
