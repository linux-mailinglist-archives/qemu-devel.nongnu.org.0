You can't actually skip SET_VRING_CALL, it's necessary to start a vring,
so libvhost-user for example calls dev->iface->queue_set_started() only
in this case. The docs in the "Starting and stopping rings" section also
explain this.

I don't think if you enable this you care about performance, after all
the whole point of it is to get REPLY_ACK for the in-band message.

Sure.

See above. But I guess we could put a flag into bit 9 indicating that
you want to use messages instead of polling or a file descriptor, if you
prefer.

I confused this far too many times and thought I got it right finally,
but yes, you're right.
