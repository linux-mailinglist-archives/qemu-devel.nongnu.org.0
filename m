Calling it micromanaging is putting a very negative connotation on
this. What we're trying todo is enforce a host resource policy for
QEMU, in a way that a compromised QEMU can't escape, which is a
valuable protection.

We use cgroups where it is available to us, but we don't always have
the freedom that we'd like. Sometimes the deployment scenario of
libvirt means that we're stuck with whatever cgroup libvirtd is
launched in and sched_setaffinity is our only way to confine QEMU,
so wanting to prevent use of sched_setaffinity is reasonable IMHO.

With regards,
Daniel
