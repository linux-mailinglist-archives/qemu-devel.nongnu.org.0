In order to help license compliance tools (following [1] guidance),
use Qualcomm License Identifier tool [*] to classify linux-user/
files per license type, filtering those matching at least 60% the
"GPLv2 or later" type, and manually add the GPL-2.0-or-later SPDX
comment.

Full, abbreviated, oddly-indented/wrapped license texts are kept
unmodified.

Example of the tool output:

  $ license-identifier --output_format easy_read \
      --threshold 0.6 --input_path linux-user \
    | egrep '(Name of the input file|Matched license type is|The found license text has the score of)'
    | fgrep -1 GPL-2.0+
  Name of the input file: linux-user/cpu_loop-common.h
  Matched license type is GPL-2.0+
  The found license text has the score of 0.69
  --
  Name of the input file: linux-user/exit.c
  Matched license type is GPL-2.0+
  The found license text has the score of 0.685
  --
  Name of the input file: linux-user/fd-trans.c
  Matched license type is GPL-2.0+
  The found license text has the score of 0.715
  --
  Name of the input file: linux-user/fd-trans.h
  Matched license type is GPL-2.0+
  The found license text has the score of 0.715
  --
  Name of the input file: linux-user/flatload.c
  Matched license type is GPL-2.0+
  The found license text has the score of 0.715
