Perhaps we can get rid of it if we find a suitable filter.

Hmm, Python comes with one: "python -m json.tool".  It expects just one
expression, and fails if anything follows:

    $ printf '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}\n{"execute": "query-version"}=
\n' | socat UNIX:/work/armbru/images/test-qmp STDIO | python3 -m json.tool
    Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 134)

To pretty print a sequence of expressions, you have to wrap a loop
around it:

    $ printf '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}\n{"execute": "query-version"}=
\n' | socat UNIX:/work/armbru/images/test-qmp STDIO | { while read line; do=
 echo "$line" | python3 -m json.tool; done; }
    {
        "QMP": {
            "version": {
                "qemu": {
                    "micro": 50,
                    "minor": 0,
                    "major": 4
                },
                "package": "v4.0.0-1467-g6385dd6613"
            },
            "capabilities": [
                "oob"
            ]
        }
    }
    {
        "return": {}
    }
    {
        "return": {
            "qemu": {
                "micro": 50,
                "minor": 0,
                "major": 4
            },
            "package": "v4.0.0-1467-g6385dd6613"
        }
    }

I figure we'd want to loop in Python instead of shell.

My point is: pretty-printing is trivial in Python.  The case for
maintaining C code to do it seems weak.
