It happens in VPATH too - and what's more, in VPATH, it is still=20
creating it under srcdir rather than builddir, which feels like=20
unnecessary pollution.  I was trying to prove whether 'make distclean'=20
got us back to a pristine state; this was one of the files that escaped=20
'make distclean', so our choice is to either add it to the clean rules,=20
or to avoid creating it in the first place.  I like the approach of not=20
creating it in the first place :)

That said,

> +    PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=3Dyes "$sphinx_build" -c "$source_path/docs"=
 -b html "$TMPDIR1/sphinx" "$TMPDIR1/sphinx/out" >/dev/null 2>&1

is now even a longer line; is it worth adding \-newline to split it up?
