Title:
  window 8 stuck during boot on Qemu

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Description of problem:
  I've got windows 8 image(64 bit), installed on Qemu(x86-64_softmmu) and t=
hen i'm trying to boot/shutdown it in the same Qemu configuration. Windows =
8 has feature - when you click "Shutdown" in UI, windows 8 doesn't actually=
 power off, it goes to "Suspend to disc" ACPI state. After shutdown, i'm tr=
ying to boot it again, but it stucks during boot.

  I've discovered, that it hangs when windows 8 writes to AHCI's command re=
gister, AHCI triggers irq, but windows 8 sends EOI, don't accessing AHCI re=
gister,so irq line stills in high state, and irq will be injected again and=
 again, while windows will send EOI on each AHCI interrupt. Strange thing i=
s that it happens only on TCG mode or =

  with option "kernel-irqchip=3Doff/split", with "kernel-irqchip=3Don" ever=
ything works ok(windows 8 accesses AHCI register and line goes to low state=
).

  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
  Qemu revision: d8276573da58e8ce78dab8c46dd660efd664bcb7

  =

  Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Install Windows 8 on QEMU(qemu command line: "-enable-kvm -m 1G -hda <=
image>  -serial stdio  -cpu core2duo -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Doff"
  2. Click shutdown in UI.
  3. Try to boot again(it will stuck)
  4. Kill Qemu and boot again, it will boot, now go to 2) :)
