Maybe it is better to filter all the feature bits, but the dirty bit,
since only it is needed here, so that when we start running tests with
more features, we won't need to do this again?

I am wondering if there is any better way to do this (regardless of this patch),
Basically the above code pokes into the 3rd cluster on the disk I *think*, and I don't
understand why it has to contain refcounts. Hmm...
First cluster I can guess will have the header, 2nd cluster probably L1 table, and 3rd, refcounts?
If so, the test should specify that it needs 64K clusters, because the day will come when
we will need to test this as well, but I guess in a separate patch,
