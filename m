Alex, to answer your earlier question, this is only for experimental
purposes -
to learn Qemu device modeling API better. I am trying to understand QEMU
build hierarchy and proceed to see whether I can find any solution out of
it.

Also - wanted to set right one point. The Greensocs SystemC bridge is
definitely an option if one wants to integrate device models in SystemC -
but in my case, I wanted to better understand Qemu internals.

Regards,
Pratik
