The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Feature Request:  Please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation support to the
  virtio disk emulation

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  In order to allow windows guests (and soon, linux guests) which are
  TCG OPAL 2 aware to perform disk encryption in a native fashion with
  hardware acceleration, please add TCG OPAL 2 emulation to the VIRTIO
  driver.

  Encryption should occur at the host level using any cryptographic
  facilities available to the host, for example AES-NI, Cryptography
  Hardware, underlying block device cryptography support where available
  or any other cryptography facility that may be developed and
  implemented in the future.
