Possibly, we can implement laziness by internally make only one active bitmap and merge it here and there when you request some active bitmap which we actually didn't load yet..

That's all is reasonable enough..

Than, we really need to refactor the code around bitmap support. Currently we
do keep all active bitmaps in RAM and update them in a loop on each write.
But it's obvious, the we can keep only one (with smallest granularity of existing
dirty bitmaps) to track guest writes.

Didn't you consider to use qemu started in stopped mode to do block
operations in same manner as for running vm? What's wrong with it?
Also, there is qemu-storage-daemon, which is developed as separated
binary, where block-layer is compiled in together with QMP interface.

So, this is advantage of creating bitmap over relaying on block-status capturing by block-dirty-bitmap-populate: you don't control dirtiness granularity. So, I think that bitmap propagation, or just creating new dirty bitmap to track dirtiness from start of new snapshot is better.

May be, there is a simple solution? an option for blockdev-snapshot-sync to create a bitmap in a new image (or if you create image by qemu-img, just create bitmap by qemu-img as well, using new functionality).

Isn't it simpler than to just use existing block-status-bitmap, than run a job?

Hmm, if the main use case of populating job is to merge changes since snapshot to several bitmaps (all active bitmaps?), than I think it's correct to implement exactly this semantics, allowing a list of targets as well as list of source bitmaps. We even can reuse same structure for target-list which we use for source-list. And it's simple to implement in Qemu.
