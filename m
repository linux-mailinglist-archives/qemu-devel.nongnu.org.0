My mistake.  My text leading up to my schema has it, but the schema
itself doesn't.  Obvious fix:

As struct:

    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotUpdate',
      'data': { 'active': 'bool',       # could do enum instead
                '*keyslot': 'int',
                '*secret': 'str',       # present if @active is true
                                        #   or @keyslot is absent
                '*iter-time': 'int' } } # absent if @active is false

As union:

    { 'enum': 'LUKSKeyslotState',
      'data': [ 'active', 'inactive' ] }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotActive',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                '*iter-time': 'int } }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotInactive',
      'data': { '*secret': 'str' } }    # either @secret or @keyslot presen=
t
                                        # might want to name this @old-secr=
et
    { 'union': 'LUKSKeyslotAmend',
      'base': { '*keyslot': 'int',
                'state': 'LUKSKeyslotState' }
      'discriminator': 'state',
      'data': { 'active': 'LUKSKeyslotActive',
                'inactive': 'LUKSKeyslotInactive' } }

The "deactivate secret" operation needs a bit of force to fit into the
amend interface's "describe desired state" mold: the desired state is
(state=3Dinactive, secret=3DS).  In other words, the inactive slot keeps it=
s
secret, you just can't use it for anything.

Sadly, even with a union, we now have optional members that aren't
really optional: "either @secret or @keyslot present".  To avoid that,
we'd have to come up with sane semantics for "neither" and "both".  Let
me try.

The basic idea is to have @keyslot and @secret each select a set of
slots, and take the intersection.

If @keyslot is present: { @keyslot }
               absent: all slots
If @secret is present: the set of slots holding @secret
              absent: all slots

Neither present: select all slots.
Both present: slot @keyslot if it holds @secret, else no slots

The ability to specify @keyslot and @secret might actually be
appreciated by some users.  Belt *and* suspenders.

Selecting no slots could be a no-op or an error.  As a user, I don't
care as long as I can tell what the command actually changed.

Selecting all slots is an error because deactivating the last slot is.
No different from selecting all slots with a particular secret when no
active slots with different secrets exist.

I'm not sure this is much of an improvement.

Human users may well appreciate such a "replace secret" operation.  As
so often with high-level operations, the difficulty is its failure
modes:

* Activation fails: no change (old secret still active)

* Deactivate fails: both secrets are active

Humans should be able to deal with both failure modes, provided the
error reporting is sane.

If I'd have to program a machine, however, I'd rather use the primitive
operations, because each either succeeds completely or fails completely,
which means I don't have to figure out *how* something failed.

Note that such a high-level "replace secret" doesn't quite fit into the
amend interface's "describe desired state" mold: the old secret is not
part of the desired state.

Sure.

Appropriately corrected, I hope.
