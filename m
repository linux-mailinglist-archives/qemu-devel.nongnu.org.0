  "Ideally, encrypt all of your messages to their (possibly multiple) 
   recipients. This means that you need not only the list's public key, but 
   also keys for the reporter and for anyone else CC'ed. You may exercise your 
   best effort to obtain such keys (from keyservers, by asking in the thread in 
   plaintext without quoting any sensitive content, etc.), or failing that you 
   may fallback to plaintext, in which case you should refrain from quoting 
   (and adding) non-essential sensitive content. For example, if you merely 
   want the reporter to agree to or specify a public disclosure date, then you 
   may send a plaintext message back to them with this request and nothing else 
   (most importantly, do not quote their original report)."

* Found above text for encrypted email workflow to communicate with non-member
  reporters.

* I reached out to '@solardiz' to check if the back end scripts/tools which 
  power automatic encryption on '-distros' list are available as open source 
  tools.

  Unfortunately not.

* As his suggestions/inputs for a list, he said:

* So ie. we need to:

  1. Create/setup a regular non-encrypted 'qemu-security' list.

  2. Invite representatives from user/downstream communities to subscribe to 
     it.

  3. Collect & store their PGP public keys. Also create a key for the list.

  4. Write 'encrypt & email' automation tool(s) to provide encryption support.

  5. Document and publish above details and list workflow on a page.


...wdyt?


Thank you.
