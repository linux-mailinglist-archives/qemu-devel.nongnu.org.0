Thank You, Stefan, Michael & Daniel, for your comments. I had a chance
to sit down with my teammates to understand the feedback you gave at the
KVM Forum. Thank you for that, as well.

We currently support two ways of launching the remote process - one is
self-launch through QEMU, as outlined in this patch series. The other
approach is using an Orchestrator like libvirt (we haven't had the
chance to submit those patches for review yet).

In the case where libvirt is involved, it would assume the
responsibility of spawning the remote process first and pass in the info
required to connect to the remote process via command-line arguments to
QEMU. This support in QEMU is available in the current series. We
haven't sent the libvirt side of patches out for review yet. It would be
easier to upstream libvirt once the QEMU side of things is firmed up.

In the case of self-launch, our understanding is that QEMU has the
privilege to fork() the remote process until the "-sandbox" argument is
processed. However, if an Orchestrator prohibits QEMU from spawning
other processes from the get-go, then the Orchestrator would assume the
responsibility of spawning the remote process as well - like Daniel just
pointed out.

In both cases, we intend to apply the security policies required to
confine the remote process externally - probably through SELinux. We
haven't had the chance to upstream the SELinux policies yet, but we
previously sent a sample of the policies for your comments. Like Michael
pointed out earlier, the SELinux policies are per binary.

Thank you very much!
