I prefer that we support all platforms if and when we can. That's a
technical argument, not a personal one like you those you start using
now.

You never brought that up before and sure it could be a fair argument,
except it is not true.

PMR is emulating NVRAM (and requires memory semantics). Persistent state
is not emulating anything. It is an implementation detail.

No, exactly as I wrote above, after I hit reply I considered a
follow-up. I guess I should have.

I can't believe I just read that.

I will not put up with this. It is completely non-called for. I stand up
for my opinions and I will fight to make sure the best possible code
goes upstream. Yes, I am paid by Samsung. But I can compartmentalize. I
have been working on QEMU before Samsung and I know how to separate
corporate interest and open source. I have a proven record on this list
to show that. I really cannot believe that you brought it down to that
level. I have been putting forth technical arguments throughout this
entire review process and now you are getting personal.

Not. Cool. Please keep things professional from now.

>=20

If it is so trival to fix, please fix it. I think I made it clear that I
won't be happy until it is portable.

And please note that I have *not* complained about other parts of your
series. I have complained ALOT about the persistence implementation -
and I continue to stand behind those complaints.

I'm getting super tired of this one-sided process. I have continuously
reviewed and commented your series, I have found multiple bugs, I have
suggested improvements. Maybe if just one or two of those 9 people who
signed off on your zoned implementation could look past their own nose
and look at my series - you might just realize that its decent, portable
and offers some niceties that yours do not have (at the cost of the same
amount of code mind you).
