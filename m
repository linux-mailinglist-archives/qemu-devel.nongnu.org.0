Just to be clear, concluding from your surrounding sentences, you don't
mean here to implement "hardfloat support for powerpc", but something
like "improve performance of ppc FPU emulation by misusing hardfloat
support and giving up accuracy". I think we have to be honest between
ourselves.

The whole purpose of this standard is to ensure floating point calculations=
 are consistent across multiple CPUs. I believe referring to this patch as =
inaccurate is itself inaccurate. That gives the impression that this patch =
produces calculations that are not inline with established standards. This =
is not true. The only part of this patch that will produce incorrect values=
 are the flags. There *may* be a program or two out there that depend on th=
ese flags, but for the majority of programs that only care about basic floa=
ting point arithmetic this patch will produce correct values. Currently the=
 emulated PowerPC's FPU already produces wrong values for the flags. This p=
atch does set the Inexact flag (which I don't like), but since I have never=
 encountered any source code that cares for this flag, I can let it go. I t=
hink giving the user the ability to decide which option to use is the best =
thing to do.
