Let's consider huge pages for simplicity. Assume you have 128 free huge 
pages in your hypervisor that you want to dynamically assign to VMs.

Further assume you have two VMs running. A workflow could look like

1. Assign all huge pages to VM 0
2. Reassign 64 huge pages to VM 1
3. Reassign another 32 huge pages to VM 1
4. Reasssign 16 huge pages to VM 0
5. ...

Basically what we're used to doing with "ordinary" memory.

For that to work with virtio-mem, you'll have to disable reservation of 
huge pages for the virtio-mem managed memory region.

(prealloction of huge pages in virtio-mem to protect from user mistakes 
is a separate work item)

reserve=off will be the default for virtio-mem, and actual 
reservation/preallcoation will be done within virtio-mem. There could be 
use for "reserve=off" for virtio-balloon use cases as well, but I'd like 
to exclude that from the discussion for now.

Hope that answers your question, thanks.
