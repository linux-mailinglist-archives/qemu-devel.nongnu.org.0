I am not seeing the issue here.  The manager can hot plug with cprsave as
easily as with migration, at the same transition points.  I don't see what
migration paths should be reused here.

CPR                                     Migration

- cprsave restarts qemu with the env    - qemu -S -incoming defer
var QEMU_START_FREEZE set, which
clears autostart just like -S.
(see patch 15)

- command-line devices created          - command-line devices created

- vmstate is prelaunch                  - vmstate is inmigrate

- manager sends hotplug commands        - manager sends hotplug commands

- manager sends cprload                 - manager sends migrate_incoming

It would perhaps be more correct for cprsave to leave the vm in the preconfig
state.

I don't feel like I'm suffering.  At least not yet :)
