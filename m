The microvm design has a premise and it can be answered definitively
through performance analysis.

If I had to explain to someone why PCI or ACPI significantly slows
things down, I couldn't honestly do so.  I say significantly because
PCI init definitely requires more vmexits but can it be a small
number?  For ACPI I have no idea why it would consume significant
amounts of time.

Until we have this knowledge, the premise of microvm is unproven and
merging it would be premature because maybe we can get into the same
ballpark by optimizing existing code.

I'm sorry for being a pain.  I actually think the analysis will
support microvm, but it still needs to be done in order to justify it.
