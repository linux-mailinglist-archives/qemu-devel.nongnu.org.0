An attempt to do an exception-return (branch to one of the magic
addresses) in linux-user mode for M-profile should behave like
a normal branch, because linux-user mode is always going to be
in 'handler' mode. This used to work, but we broke it when we added
support for the M-profile security extension in commit d02a8698d7ae2bfed.

In that commit we allowed even handler-mode calls to magic return
values to be checked for and dealt with by causing an
EXCP_EXCEPTION_EXIT exception to be taken, because this is
needed for the FNC_RETURN return-from-non-secure-function-call
handling. For system mode we added a check in do_v7m_exception_exit()
to make any spurious calls from Handler mode behave correctly, but
forgot that linux-user mode would also be affected.

How an attempted return-from-non-secure-function-call in linux-user
mode should be handled is not clear -- on real hardware it would
result in return to secure code (not to the Linux kernel) which
could then handle the error in any way it chose. For QEMU we take
the simple approach of treating this erroneous return the same way
it would be handled on a CPU without the security extensions --
treat it as a normal branch.

The upshot of all this is that for linux-user mode we should never
do any of the bx_excret magic, so the code change is simple.

This ought to be a weird corner case that only affects broken guest
code (because Linux user processes should never be attempting to do
exception returns or NS function returns), except that the code that
assigns addresses in RAM for the process and stack in our linux-user
code does not attempt to avoid this magic address range, so
legitimate code attempting to return to a trampoline routine on the
stack can fall into this case. This change fixes those programs,
but we should also look at restricting the range of memory we
use for M-profile linux-user guests to the area that would be
real RAM in hardware.
