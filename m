The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  SVM emulation fails due to EIP and FLAG register update optimization

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  SVM emulation support has a bug due to which causes KVM emulation
  error when qemu-kvm is run over KVM installed on top of QEmu in
  software mode.

  Steps to reproduce
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  1. Run KVM inside QEmu(software mode with SVM emulation support). Make su=
re kvm_amd is running.
  2. Run any guest OS on top of the KVM using qemu-kvm.
  3. Following KVM emulation error is thrown immediately.

  KVM internal error. Suberror: 1

  Due to performance reasons, EIP and FLAG registers are not updated after =
executing every guest instructions. There are optimizations done to update =
these registers intelligently, for eg: EIP is updated at the end of transla=
tion block. This means EIP remains the address of the first instruction in =
the TB throughout the execution.

  In case of a VMEXIT because of a page fault happened after executing
  an instruction in the middle of the TB, the VMCB is updated with the
  wrong guest EIP and jumps to the address where host has left off. On
  the subsequent VMRUN by the host QEmu start executing some of the
  instructions that has already been executed. This can cause wrong
  execution flow.

  Following is the instruction execution trace of the above scenario.

  0x00000000000f368f: callq 0xeecc4
  vmexit(00000060, 0000000000000000, 0000000000000000, 00000000000eecc4)!
  vmsave! 00000000b72e9000
  vmload! 00000000b72e9000
  vmrun! 00000000b72e9000
  0x00000000000eecc4: push %rbx
  0x00000000000eecc5: xor %ecx,%ecx
  0x00000000000eecc7: mov (%rax,%rcx,1),%bl
  0x00000000000eecca: cmp (%rdx,%rcx,1),%bl
  vmexit(0000004e, 0000000000000000, 00000000000f5ea0, 00000000000eecc4)!

  Page fault happens at 0x00000000000eecca which triggers a VMEXIT.
  vmcb->save->rip is updated with 0x00000000000eecc4 instead of
  0x00000000000eecca.

  vmsave! 00000000b72e9000
  vmload! 00000000b72e9000
  vmrun! 00000000b72e9000
  0x00000000000eecc4: push %rbx
  0x00000000000eecc5: xor %ecx,%ecx
  0x00000000000eecc7: mov (%rax,%rcx,1),%bl
  0x00000000000eecca: cmp (%rdx,%rcx,1),%bl
  0x00000000000eeccd: je 0xeecdc
  0x00000000000eeccf: setl %al
  0x00000000000eecd2: movzbl %al,%eax
  0x00000000000eecd5: neg %eax
  0x00000000000eecd7: or $0x1,%eax
  0x00000000000eecda: jmp 0xeece3
  0x00000000000eece3: pop %rbx
  0x00000000000eece4: retq
  vmexit(0000004e, 0000000000000000, 0000000040000000, 0000000040000000)!

  The subsequent VMRUN again starts executing from 0x00000000000eecc4
  which causes %rbx being pushed to the stack for the second time. The
  retq instruction picks wrong return address and jumps to an illegal
  location.

  Similar issue is there with updating FLAG register as well.
