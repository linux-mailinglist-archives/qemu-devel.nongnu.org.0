No objection; but what should our general policy with regard to wiki
pages vs. documentation be? The 3270 support is pretty much static, but
e.g. for vfio-ccw, we use the wiki page as a place where we track
things that should be worked on etc.

(Related: What is the scope of our QEMU documentation? Is a libvirt XML
snippet on topic? Kernel configuration options (as in here)?)
