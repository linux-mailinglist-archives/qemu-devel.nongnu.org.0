QOM is an *internal* object model. It's fine for building
machine models *in C*. We have no mechanism for doing
this on the command line or via QMP, because there are
lots of parts of machine models (listed in the first
paragraph above) which aren't possible to do with purely
generic links and properties.

Yeah, I have no objection to useful internal changes that
move generally in directions we'd like to go. But if
"machines via config files" really is a goal I'd like to
see at least a sketch of a design, rationale, summary of
what would need to change and proposals for what would be
done. And I don't think we should be exposing "MMIO addresses"
to users without at least some idea of why that would
fit in with other things we would be doing to move
towards where we're going.

(TBH: I also don't really see 'machines via config
files' as a serious project goal -- we haven't really moved
towards doing that in a decade, as far as I can see.)

thanks
