Indeed, comparing the trace files of both the RC1 and RC2 kernels is one of
the things I did, and many more.

After extensive low-level debugging, I discovered that the issue is much
more simple than I thought.
In particular, when using -sd <file>, the emulated device gets the same
physical size as the file.
Normally this is not a problem, but for the NetBSD RC2 image, the kernel
reads the MBR partition table,
compares it with the device size and concludes that the NetBSD partition in
the image is larger than the actual device.

Unfortunately, this root cause is not printed on the NetBSD console, only
the final  'can't open root device' message.
Also, when running on hardware, obviously the SD card will be larger, e.g.
4GB or more, so that is why this issue does not show.

So the fix is to extend the input image by a few megabytes before booting
it.
And on the positive side, with this search we now have more confidence that
the
emulated SD/MMC device in Qemu works as expected.

Kind regards,
Niek
