What happens if you first create the image (which would be preallocated
with this patch), then you resize it and finally you assign the backing
file? Would the resized part be preallocated?

But you wouldn't fix that preallocating the metadata either, you would
need to fill the device with zeroes.

The way I interpret it is that regardless of whether you read the data
through the qcow2 file or directly from the data file you should get the
same results, but how that should be reflected in the L1/L2 metadata is
not specified.
