Yes, this makes sense to me. The question to answer seems to be where
this functionality would fit in - first of all, frontend (inside the
device emulation) or backend. And it's not an easy quesiton, but see
below.

We do already gather some basic statistics, and it would probably make
sense to add more things there. This is pretty clearly a job for the
backend, I think. If the information is easy to collect, we can add it
in the normal I/O path, otherwise an optional filter block driver could
do this.

The overlap seems big enough that we can't ignore it. blkdebug was
primarily meant to debug image format block drivers like qcow2, but
because this means that it can inject I/O errors if specific sectors are
accessed, it makes sense to just use the same functionality for guest
devices, too.

I/O error inserted by blkdebug can be one-off or permanent, but since it
also supports using a small state machine, I think you should already be
able to configure your errors that are corrected by a rewrite, too, even
if there is no explicit support for this yet (I guess we could add it if
it turned out to be much easier to use).

The one thing I see in your series that we can't currently provide this
way is the exact sector number where the error happened. If you read
from sector 32 to 64 and there is an error configured for sector 50, you
just see that the whole request is failing.


I also wonder why you had to write low-level error handling code instead
of calling the existing error functions. If the existing functions don't
give the right result in error cases, shouldn't they be fixed anyway?

And then, as John already hinted, adding code for debugging scenarios to
hot paths that are important for high-performance VMs that don't use any
debugging is less than optimal.


So bringing everything together, what would you think of this plan:

1. Extend blkdebug with whatever ways you need to trigger I/O errors
   (only if the existing modes aren't sufficient at least for the start;
   we can still always extend it later)

2. Add a new BlockDriver callback that can return detailed information
   about an error (such as the exact sector number), and wire it up
   through BlockBackend (some blk_* function). Implement it in blkdebug.

3. In the guest devices, only call the function to get detailed error
   information in the existing error path. You can then update some
   device state according to the details if the block driver returned
   anything (probably only blkdebug will return something).

This way, we have no changes at all in the hot I/O path if you didn't
configure your VM with a blkdebug filter. And we avoid duplication of
code both in the error handler in devices and in the error injection
mechanisms.
