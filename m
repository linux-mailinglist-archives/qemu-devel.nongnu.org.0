In my current implementation, cold/warm is only a question of setting a
flag before calling the reset methods. I rely and the reset methods to
check that flag if necessary. The feature can be added/removed without
pain (if we stick with device_reset to do a cold one). So if it's
better, I can put it aside for now.

IMO handling warm reset with another interface is probably not a good
idea because it will need another load of methods.
