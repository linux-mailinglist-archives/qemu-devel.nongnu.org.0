Thanks for the review, I've updated comments and sent v10. David is away 
this week so maybe it's only Philippe now who could still take this series 
before it's too late for 6.0 (if it isn't already).

These are adding new device model that's only used by the new machine. How 
could it regress anything? Those patches that changed existing devices are 
already upstream. Also if it touches anything that's fuloong2e which is 
harfly critical and was barely working before I've started to clean it up 
to be able to use it's devices as a basis for pegasos2. Lastly the freeze 
is for finding and fixing regressions but for that the series should first 
be allowed to get in to be tested more widely.

I don't know how to run Gitlab CI, I don't even have an account. Thought 
that's what maintainers are there for to run these tests.
