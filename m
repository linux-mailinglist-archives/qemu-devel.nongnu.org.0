No. Libvirt threats error messages as an opaque data. In a few cases we=20
check for the class of the error and for instance issue a different=20
command if class was CommandNotFound. You are free to change error=20
messages as you wish.

Note that this is not true for HMP - there libvirt does some parsing to=20
figure out the source of error. For instance:

_text.c;h=3D9054682d608b13347880f36cacd0e023151322e6;hb=3DHEAD#l36
