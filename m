Hi Johannes,
Check out vhost-user.  It's a protocol for running a subset of a VIRTIO
device's emulation in a separate process (usually just the data plane
with the PCI emulation and other configuration/setup still handled by
QEMU).

vhost-user uses a UNIX domain socket to pass file descriptors to shared
memory regions.  This way the vhost-user device backend process has
access to guest RAM.

This would be quite different for UML since my understanding is you
don't have guest RAM but actual host Linux processes, but vhost-user
might still give you ideas:
