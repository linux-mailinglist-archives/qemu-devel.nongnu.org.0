We should be able to catch bogus values with :

    object_property_set_uint(OBJECT(&bmc->soc), ram_size, "ram-size",
                             &error_abort);

in aspeed_machine_init() and let QEMU exit.

OK. We will give them a try. I don't think you have to bother with=20
bmc->max_ram for the moment. It doesn't seem to be in your way.=20

Thanks,
