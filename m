We can't just stop the time when the machine decides to schedule another container/vm. I briefly checked the public bare-metal offerings like rackspace but these are most probably not sufficient either because (unless I'm wrong) they only give you a machine but it is not guaranteed that it will be the same machine the next time. If we are to compare the results we don't need just the same model, we really need the very same machine. Any change to the machine might lead to a significant difference (disk replacement, even firmware update...).

Yes. At this point I only test host->guest connection, but run-perf is prepared to test multi-host connection as well (tested with uperf, but dedicated traffic generator could be added as well). Another machine is promised but not yet on the way.

Not sure what you mean by that. For provisioning I have a beaker plugin, other plugins can be added if needed. Even without beaker one can also provide an installed machine and skip the provisioning step. Runperf would then only apply the profiles (including fetching the VM images from public sources) and run the tests on them. Note that for certain profiles might need to reboot the machine and in such case the tested machine can not be the one running run-perf, other profiles can use the current machine but it's still not a very good idea as the additional overhead might spoil the results.

Note that for a very simple issue which do not require a special setup I am usually just running a custom VM on my laptop and use a Localhost profile on that VM, which basically results in testing that custom-setup VM's performance. It's dirty but very fast for the first-level check.
