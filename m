So, you're arguing that since 4.2 has the same bug, slipping the fix to=20
5.1 instead of 5.0 is not bad because it's not a regression new to 5.0.=20
Yes, that's a reasonable answer, if a fix is not fast.

Is a preallocation of metadata sufficient to report things correctly?=20
If so, it seems like a reasonable compromise to me.  I was more=20
envisioning a fix elsewhere: if we are reporting block status of what=20
looks like an unallocated cluster, but data-file-raw is set, we change=20
our answer to instead report it as allocated with unknown contents.  But=20
with preallocation, you either force the qcow2 file to list no cluster=20
as unallocated (which matches the fact that the raw image really is=20
fully allocated) while not touching the raw image, or you can go one=20
step further and request full preallocation to wipe the raw image to 0=20
in the process.

And by mentioning preallocation, you've managed to convince me that we=20
may already have exactly the option I was envisioning.
