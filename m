Host: I tried both Windows (10 64bit 19.09) and Linux host (Mint 19.3
64bit, kernel 5.40) system it really doesnt matters.

Guest: Windows 98 - has integrated MS-DOS 7.1 you can boot into it through =
boot menu, which could be set by meditation of MSDOS.SYS, but you can insta=
ll MS-DOS 7.1 Standalone too, without Windows, its the same.
 https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/7x
 What DOS is after set up through Autoexec.bat and config.sys files. =

 Using DOS 7.1 make sense, because its most modern and supporting FAT32 fil=
e system.

 There is Qemu starting line i doubt that it will help, you can simulate pr=
oblem with any DOS machine.
qemu-system-i386.exe ^
-m 64 ^
-hda HDDs\MS-DOS-Systen-5G.vmdk ^
-hdb HDDs\DosData20G.vmdk ^

-net nic,model=3Drtl8139 ^
-net tap,ifname=3DTAP ^
-cdrom Isos\dos71cd.iso ^
-k en-us

 With Windows 98 - i run just commands in monitor.. open my computer and
open cd drive - content of cd is changed.. its the same as in all later
OSes XP- to Win10. Its working as expected.

 DOS - i boot into dos with cd drive driver enabled (lest say MSCDEX).. i r=
un monitor, change cd image.. a trying to access it lets say that is drive =
E.. So i write "E:" <ENTER> to command line. I get error that drive is not =
accessible.. (command line should be switched to E:\ and here i should be a=
ble use "dir" to get list of files) but when i reboot machine, i see new ex=
change cd content.. so its at least somehow working.
  Problem is that some games and programs require change cd on the fly, so =
reboot is not solution.
  =

   You can simulate right behavior with Vmware or Virtualbox machine.

   Is you are not familar with MS-DOS, here are command to autoexec and con=
fig for enable use of cd-rom drive:
https://superuser.com/questions/778716/install-a-cd-rom-driver-on-ms-dos

  Problem is probably that present version of cd exchange simulation
code is not good enough / compatible for MSCDEX or SHSUCDX DOS CD-ROM
drivers.. to make same action as is exchange cd on physical computer.

  Windows 98 and later are using other drivers for it of course..

Title:
  Dos on the fly CD image replacement is not Working with DOS

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Im not able to exchange CD image on the fly (needed for some games). I
  messed with command like - in console(ATL+CRTL+2) eject ide1-cd0 and
  change ide-cd0 D:/Games/!Emulators/Dos-QEMU/ISOs/TestChangeISO.iso ,
  but system so never able to find new CD data.. simply drive so empty..
  but when i reboot virtual machine, new change image is now working.

    Qemu 4.2.
