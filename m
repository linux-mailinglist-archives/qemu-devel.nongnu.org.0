&gt; <br>
&gt; Hehe its okey, I can change it to whichever is preferable: the minimum=
 set<br>
&gt; with unimplemented device entries to get a working linux kernel / u-bo=
ot or<br>
&gt; just cover the full memory space from the datasheet. My initial though=
t <br>
&gt; was that if<br>
&gt; we only provide the minimum set, and the linux kernel later adds a new=
 <br>
&gt; driver for a device<br>
&gt; which is not marked unimplemented, it will trigger the data abort and =
<br>
&gt; potentially resulting in a non-booting kernel.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; But I&#39;m not sure what is normally done here. I do see other board =
files <br>
&gt; using the create_unimplemented_device() function,<br>
&gt; but I dont know if they are covering the whole memory space or not.<br=
>
<br>
If they don&#39;t cover all memory regions, the guest code can trigger a <b=
r>
data abort indeed. Since we don&#39;t know the memory layout of old board, =
<br>
they are still supported with ignore_memory_transaction_failures=3Dtrue, <b=
r>
so guest still run unaffected.<br>
We expect new boards to implement the minimum layout.<br>
As long as your guest is happy and usable, UNIMP devices are fine, <br>
either as big region or individual device (this requires someone with <br>
access to the datasheet to verify). If you can add a UNIMP for each <br>
device - which is what you did - it is even better because the the unimp <b=
r>
access log will be more useful, having finer granularity.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0&gt; I added all the missing devices as unimplemented and removed the=
<br>
=C2=A0&gt; ignore_memory_transaction_failures flag<br>
<br>
IOW, you already did the best you could do :)<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Did you add the UART1 as UNIMP or 16550?<br>

&gt; I tried to find a way to increase the memory mapped size of the serial=
 <br>
&gt; device I created with serial_mm_init(),<br>
&gt; but I don&#39;t think its possible with that interface.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I did manage to get it working by overlaying the UART0 with another <b=

&gt; unimplemented device<br>
&gt; that does have an I/O size of 0x400, but I guess that is probably not =
<br>
&gt; the solution we are looking for?<br>
<br>
IMHO this is the correct solution :)<br>
<br>
Memory regions have priority. By default a device has priority 0, and <br>
UNIMP device has priority -1000.<br>
<br>
So you can use:<br>
