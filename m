The above virsh command is a direct (unsupported/experimental) command
passthrough to qemu, thus the syntax is identical to raw QMP.

You must use blockdev-backup as outlined above along with any management
necessary for adding the devices previously. Obviously this may
desynchronize state with libvirt.

The current state is that libvirt will support backup only with
-blockdev. In that case everything including encrypted images should be
supported same way as we (will [1]) support them with snapshots or
normal disks.

This is currently being worked on.

[1] All the code for blockdev is in but it's not enabled yet as we are
waiting for the possibility to detect the fix for 'savevm' done
recently. -blockdev will be supported with qemu-4.2.
