If we are only talking about one ivshmem link and vm1 is the master, 
there is not role for virtio_ivshmem on it as backend. That is purely a 
frontend driver. Vice versa for vm2: If you want to use its ivshmem 
instance as virtio frontend, uio_ivshmem plays no role.

The "crash" is would be interesting to understand: Do you see kernel 
panics of the guests? Or are they stuck? Or are the QEMU instances 
stuck? Do you know that you can debug the guest kernels via gdb (and 
gdb-scripts of the kernel)?

I'm currently working on a refresh of the Jailhouse queue and the kernel 
patches to incorporate just two smaller changes:

  - use Siemens device ID
  - drop "features" register from ivshmem device

I have not yet touched the QEMU code for that so far, thus no conflict 
yet. I would wait for your patches then.

If it helps us to work on this together, I can push things to github as 
well. Will drop you a note when done. We should just present the outcome 
frequently as new series to the list.

Thanks for the positive feedback. I'm looking forward to work on this 
together!
