Where are these tests and how to run them? I'm not aware of such tests so=
=20
I've only tried running simple guest code to test changes but if there ar=
e=20
more extensive FP tests I'd better use those.

This is simple but I've found that while it seems to make some vector=20
instructions faster it also makes most simple FP ops slower because it=20
will go thorugh checking if it can use hardfloat but never can because th=
e=20
fp_status is cleared before every FP op. That's why I've set inexact bit=20
to let it use hardfloat and be able to test if it would work at all.=20
That's all my RFC patch did, I've had a 2nd version trying to avoid slow=20
down with above #if defined() dropped but hardfloat=3Dfalse so it only us=
es=20
softfloat as before but it did not worked out too well, some tests said v=
2=20
was even slower. Maybe to avoid overhead we should add a variable instead=
=20
of the QEMU_NO_HARDFLOAT define that can be set during runtime but=20
probably that won't be faster either. Thus it seems there's no way to=20
enable hardfloat for PPC and not have slower performance for most FP ops=20
without also doing some of the other points below (even if it's beneficia=
l=20
for vector ops).

This would either need someone who knows PPC FPU or someone who can take=20
the time to learn and go through the code. Not sure I want to volunteer=20
for that. But I think the clearing of the flags is mainly to emulate FI=20
bit which is an non-sticky inexact bit that should show the inexact statu=
s=20
of last FP op. (There's another simliar bit for fraction rounded as well=20
but that does not disable hardfloat.) Question is if we really want to=20
accurately emulate these bits? Are there any software we care about=20
relying on these? If we can live with not having correct FI bit emulation=
=20
(which was the case for a long time until these were fixed) then we could=
=20
have an easy way to enable hardfloat without more extensive changes. If w=
e=20
want to accurately emulate also these bits then we probably will need=20
changes to softfloat to allow registering FP exception handlers so we=20
don't have to clear and check bits but can get an exception from FPU and=20
then can set those bits but I have no idea how to do that.
