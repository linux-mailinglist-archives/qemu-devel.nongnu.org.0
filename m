Yeah, the initial gitlab-ci.yml file was one of the very first YAML file
and one the very first CI files that I wrote, with hardly any experience
in this area ... there is definitely a lot of room for improvement here!

Ok, full ack for the idea to use separate pipelines for the testing
(Philippe once showed me this idea already, too, he's using it for EDK2
testing IIRC). But the example with the build-tci is quite bad. The
single steps here are basically just a subset of "check-qtest" to skip
the tests that we are not interested in here. If we don't care about
losing some minutes of testing, we can simply replace all those steps
with "make check-qtest" again.

I think what we really want to put into different pipelines are the
sub-steps of "make check", i.e.:

- check-block
- check-qapi-schema
- check-unit
- check-softfloat
- check-qtest
- check-decodetree

And of course also the other ones that are not included in "make check"
yet, e.g. "check-acceptance" etc.

If I understood correctly, it's not about running the check steps in
parallel with "make -jXX" in one pipeline, but rather about running the
different test steps in different pipelines. So you get a separate
output for each test subsystem.

I think it should be sufficient to define a simple set of artifacts like:

- tests/*
- *-softmmu/qemu-system-*
- qemu-img, qemu-nbd ... and all the other helper binaries
- Makefile*

... and maybe some more missing files. It's some initial work, but once
we have the basic list, I don't expect to change it much in the course
of time.
