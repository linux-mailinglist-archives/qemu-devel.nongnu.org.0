A couple of remarks.

Silently passing a "# =3D=3D something" line to rST for literal
(mis-)interpretation is not nice.  It's the kind of indifference that
led to the messes you cleaned up in PATCH 04 and 08.  If the '=3D' markup
is only valid in certain places, it should be rejected where it isn't.

By refusing to translate "# =3D=3D something" to rST (silently or loudly,
doesn't matter), the first tree structure becomes impossible.  Except
when I do the translating myself: I can put an *rST* section wherever I
want.

I'm still having difficulties understanding what exactly we gain by
translating '=3D' markup to rST.

By the way, your implementation rejects

    ##
    # =3D Introduction
    # xxx
    ##

but silently accepts

    ##
    # xxx
    # =3D Introduction
    ##

doc-good.json has more instances of this issue.  Before your series, we
actually check we generate the Texinfo we expect for it.  I can't find
where you cover this now.  It has saved me from my screwups more than
once, so I don't want to lose that.

Now let's put my doubts and your possible bugs / omissions aside and
assume we want '=3D' markup, and we want to keep the resulting sections
out of "sections created by the script for a QAPI command".

A schema's documentation is a sequence of comment blocks.

Each comment block is either a definition comment block or a free form
comment block.

Before your series, we recognize '=3D' markup everywhere, but that's
basically wrong (see "flaws in our parsing and representation of doc
comments" above).  It should be accepted only in free-form comment
blocks.

That way, the free-form comment blocks build a section structure, and
the definition comment blocks slot their stuff into this structure.

Form a language design perspective, I can't see the need for restricting
'=3D' further to occur only by themselves.

Is it an issue of implementation perhaps?
