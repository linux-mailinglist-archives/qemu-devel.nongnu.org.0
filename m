I'm not sure how there could already be any allocated clusters in the
area that we just added? (Apart from preallocation, of course, which is
why this is restricted to PREALLOC_MODE_OFF.)

You're right that if this truncate was called in the context of a commit
block job rather than a resize, the zeros might be overwritten later.
I'm not sure if leaving clusters unallocated while the job is running
(and might be cancelled) is right, though. On the other hand, while the
job is running, the target image on its own is invalid anyway.

Also note that raw doesn't support backing files and qcow2 generally
supports zero writes. If you use an external data file and backing file
at the same time and your file system doesn't support zero writes, you
could run into the problem. Or if you use a more unusual image format
(including qcow2 v2).

So it's really two corner cases combined.
