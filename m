Hmm, that's not ideal. The C is valid C which the compiler accepts, so
I'm not sure what Sphinx is complaining about, and I don't have a system
with that new a version of Sphinx.

It does suggest that we ought to make our configure --enable-werror
/--disable-werror (and the code that makes the default be disable for
releases) control Sphinx's warnings-as-errors option as well as the
compiler's, which would at least mean that for released versions the
build doesn't fail entirely on Sphinx warnings.

  We've just updated Sphinx to version 3.0.1 and qemu fails to build the
