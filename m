Will fix in next iteration.

I think your above explanation is indeed correct (which I couldn't have
articulated so well; thanks!), based on my understanding, and reading
Andrea's patch[*] and its commit message:

    "This [patch] replaces all kvm_x86_ops pointer to functions with
    regular external functions that don't require indirect calls.

    "[...] The pointer to function virtual template model cannot provide
    any runtime benefit because kvm-intel and kvm-amd can't be loaded at
    the same time. [...]"


[*] https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/20/932 --  [PATCH 02/17] KVM:
    monolithic: x86: convert the kvm_x86_ops methods to external functions

Will fix; thanks for the thorough review.
