The challenge here is that I need the docker tag name to be in an env
variable in the gitlab-ci.yml file.

I can directly use $CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME  to get the branch name but
the list of valid characters for a git branch is way more permissive
than valid characters for a docker tag.

So we need to filter the git branch name to form a valid docker tag,
and AFAICT, there's no way todo that when setting a global env variable
in the gitlab-ci.yml.  I can only do filtering once in the before_script:
stage, and that's too late to use it in the image name for the job.

We could ignore the problem and hope people always have sane branch
names ? 

   https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/

  "A tag name must be valid ASCII and may contain lowercase and 
   uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods and dashes. 
   A tag name may not start with a period or a dash and may 
   contain a maximum of 128 characters."

that rule would cover all my git branch names, but then ASCII covers
most common english needs.  I worry that we might have contributors
who genuinely use non-ASCII chars in their git branch names, especially
those speakers of non-english/european languages eg persian, chinese,
japanese languages for example. Git is very permissive, allowing
everything except a short list

   https://www.spinics.net/lists/git/msg133704.html

  "A branch name can not:
        - Have a path component that begins with "."
        - Have a double dot ".."
        - Have an ASCII control character, "~", "^", ":" or SP, anywhere
        - End with a "/"
        - End with ".lock"
        - Contain a "\" (backslash"

The result will be if someone names their git branch "üèÇ", then all
the CI jobs will fail in gitlab.

 $ git branch üèÇ

works

 $ docker  tag 470671670cac foo:üèÇ
  Error: invalid reference format

fails

Daniel
