Nothing against this either.

This is what I wanted to do in first place, and it would be the cleanest
solution, but that would need to update the 3rd caller of this function,
the qcow2_co_pwritev_part, which does pass the cluster offset and guest f=
ull offset.
You know what, I'll just do it. A bit more changes, but much cleaner code=
 that
eliminates the possibility of this bug of happening again.

I wrote it to clarify this since Vladimir told me that its not clear enou=
gh.
Note though that I made a mistake here since the data will be written not=
 at
host_cluster_offset but in host_cluster_offset + offset_into_cluster(s, g=
uest_offset

All right, this sounds better

I don't think so, since we have symmetrical encryption here.

That would be lawyer territory, since interface is not technically the sa=
me,
since it decrypts rather that encrypts the data in the buffer...
I think that this wording should be good enough.
