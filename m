I'm going to change this a little anyway. Currently for the non-live
case, I start the migration and then  stop the CPUs. I want to reverse
that order, as we should have CPUs paused before even starting the
migration to ensure we don't have any re-dirtied pages at all.

I think in retrospect 'iterations' was overkill as we only use the
values 0 (implicitly 1) or 2. IOW we could just just a 'bool multipass'
to distinguish the two cases.

I've not successfully reproduced it yet, nor figured out a real
scenario where it could plausibly happen. i'm looking to add more
debug to help us out.
