One more hint: variables 'avrA' and 'avrB' can be a single variable, since
there is no moment during execution where both are needed; the same for
'tmp' and 'shifted'.

Also, check on the hardware the behavior listed as 'undefined' for vsl/vsr
in the docs - even though it is tehnically irrelevant, I am courious
whether the old or the new (or none of them) solution match the hardware.
