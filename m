Thanks for tracking down the source of the bug. Our 'submitting patches'

haven't already found it. (It's quite long but for a simple one-shot
bugfix patch the important stuff is just the summarized bits at the
top.)

Title:
  x86_cpu_gdb_read_register segfaults when gdb requests registers

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When attempting to attach to the gdbstub, a segfault occurs.

  I traced this down to a problem in a call to gdb_get_reg16 where the
  mem_buf was being treated like a uint8_t* instead of a GByteArray.
  The buffer passed to gdb_get_reg16 ends up passing an invalid
  GByteArray pointer, which subsequentlycauses a segfault in memcpy.

  I have a fix for this - just need to educate myself on how to submit a
  patch.
