Yes, I was not sure. Is -smp only about NUMA topology?

Should I try adding another argument, such 'online_cpus_mask'?

Well, u-boot is in the same format than the /boot/bootcode.bin 
closed-source firmware provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation. This is 
the format the GPU firmware understand when loading it on the 1st ARM core.

I'll see what I can do (ab)using the -bios parameter.

This patch doesn't modify hw/arm/boot.c and reuse -smp features,
it didn't seemed too invasive. Anyway I'll look for another path.

Thanks,

Phil.
