Hi Avi,
for the sake of giving it a try I had a second level guest and suspended/re=
sumed the first level guest a few times. I can't reproduce it.

OTOH you seem to have a hard time to identify which change introduced
this - if it was any change at all and not just by accident not showing
up before.

I feel bad for you, but right now there isn't much we could action to furth=
er help.
Especially bad since you were always so prompt in feedback to our questions=
 and suggestions :-/

I'll monitor the bug if you come up  with new insights or questions on
your debugging I'll try to help as I did so far. Thanks to Bryce who
understands UI more than I do for his input as well.

But given the current state, this most likely will stay incomplete and
un-actionable :-/

Title:
  QEMU touchpad input erratic after wakeup from sleep

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in libvirt package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Using Ubuntu host and guest. Normally the touchpad works great. Within
  the last few days, suddenly, apparently after a wake from sleep, the
  touchpad will behave erratically. For example, it will take two clicks
  to select something, and when moving the cursor it will act as though
  it is dragging even with the button not clicked.

  A reboot fixes the issue temporarily.
