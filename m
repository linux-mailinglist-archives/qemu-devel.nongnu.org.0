They're effectively regressions.  Pedantically, they're bugs in a new
feature, but since the new feature is enabled by default in the new
machine type (and it's the interrupt controller, so you can't do
without it), so it means a normal setup will be broken where the
normal setup in the old version wasn't.

Fair enough.  As I said, the timing sucked, but there's not really
anything I could do about that.
