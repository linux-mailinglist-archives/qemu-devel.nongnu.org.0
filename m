So here, bdrv_try_change_aio_context() is .prepare in the way I mean.

And than in .abort we call bdrv_try_change_aio_context() again but with reverse argument, and it's a kind of ".abort".

Probably, we can refactor that, making a function bdrv_change_aio_context(, .., tran), which does what bdrv_try_change_aio_context does, and registers .abort callback, that will simulate calling bdrv_try_change_aio_context() with opposite arguement.  But we should carefully refactor all the function names and avoid having nested transaction.
