Following up here *too*, just for completeness.

The query in this thread has been posted three times now (and I have
zero idea why). Each time it generated a different set of responses. For
completes, I'm now going to link the other two threads here (because the
present thread seems to have gotten the most feedback).

To the OP:

- please do *NOT* repost the same question once you get an answer. It
  only fragments the discussion and creates confusion. It also doesn't
  hurt if you *confirm* that you understood the answer.

- Yet further, if your email address has @gmail.com for domain, but your
  msgids contain "tencent", that raises some eyebrows (mine for sure).
  You say "we" in the query, but never identify the organization behind
  the plural pronoun.

(I've been fuming about the triple-posting of the question for a while
now, but it's only now that, upon seeing how much work Dan has put into
his answer, I've decided that dishing out a bit of netiquette would be
in order.)

* First posting:
- msgid:      <tencent_F1295F826E46EDFF3D77812B@qq.com>
- edk2-devel: https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/54146
- qemu-devel: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-02/msg0241=
9.html

  * my response:
    - msgid:      <12553.1581366059422195003@groups.io>
    - edk2-devel: https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/54161
    - qemu-devel: none, because (as an exception) I used the stupid
                  groups.io web interface to respond, and so my response
                  never reached qemu-devel

* Second posting (~4 hours after the first)
- msgid:      <tencent_3CD8845EC159F0161725898B@qq.com>
- edk2-devel: https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/54147
- qemu-devel: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-02/msg0241=
5.html

  * Dave's response:
    - msgid:      <20200220154742.GC2882@work-vm>
    - edk2-devel: https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/54681
    - qemu-devel: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-02/msg=
05632.html

* Third posting (next day, present thread) -- cross posted to yet
  another list (!), because apparently Dave's feedback and mine had not
  been enough:
- msgid:        <tencent_BC7FD00363690990994E90F8@qq.com>
- edk2-devel:   https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/54220
- edk2-discuss: https://edk2.groups.io/g/discuss/message/135
- qemu-devel:   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-02/msg02=
735.html

Back on topic: see my response again. The answer is, you can't solve the
problem (specifically with OVMF), and QEMU in fact does you service by
preventing the migration.
