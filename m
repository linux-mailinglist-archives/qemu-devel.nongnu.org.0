Sure.

Agreed, but do we really want to do it?  We have been avoiding
exposing QOM internals to the outside on purpose.  I believe
there are at least two reasons for that:

1) Not every QOM type/property is supposed to be visible to the
   outside (and nobody really knows what's the full set of
   supported external QOM interfaces);
2) QAPI is our preferred interface interface specification/introspection
   mechanism.

Should we really spend our time designing a second solution, if
we could build this on top of QAPI abstractions?  Making the QAPI
schema dynamic might be hard, but reinventing QAPI and
maintaining the two systems in parallel seems harder.

I expect it to be useful for things that have obvious
replacements, like old machine type or CPU model versions.

If something is important enough to be communicated through
stderr, it's important enough to be communicated through QMP.
Is that enough reason to provide something more complex?

Do we need QAPI features to be just strings?  Can't they be a
more complex type, like a QAPI alternate?
