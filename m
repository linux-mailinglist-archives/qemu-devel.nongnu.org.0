For normal migration, the VM is still running and changing its state, so
you would have to wait until migration completes and then snapshot the
disk. This is possible, but it would store redundant data and the
snapshot would be at an arbitrary point after actually receiving the
snapshot command, which is probably not what users expect.

So what you really want is some kind of postcopy migration inside the
same process. Virtuozzo had a look at this some years ago and when the
discussion comes up again, they say they are still kind of interested,
though it's not their priority. I have never seen the actual code, but I
imagine it's not trivial (unless the migration code already supports
something like this today, but I'm not aware of another use case for it,
so probably not?)

There is blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync, which does a disk-only
snapshot of a single node. A snapshot of multiple nodes can be taken by
putting multiple blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync inside a 'transaction'
command.

If we want to build on top of this, we'd have to implement a
transactionable command for storing only the VM state to a specific
node. This would probably still be a long-running job.

So some of it does exist, but I'm torn on whether separating things into
different commands is actually a good idea or not.
