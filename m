It sounds like I have the same problem.

There is a virtual wall where the mouse cursor goes from the guest window t=
o the host desktop.
This virtual wall/cut off point is consistent.
Moving the mouse faster seems to break through this wall and puts the wall =
at a different place.

For me this happens on a host with ubuntu 19.10 with wayland.
I don't have the issue on ubuntu 19.10 with X.

Title:
  mouse offset or invisible wall 2.11.0-3

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  (There was another post, I'm not sure if it is related though. Also
  not sure if it's Arch related, I wouldn't be surprised as I normally
  use Gentoo and have less problems with Gentoo.)

  When I grab the mouse in/out of the VM I tend to get an "invisible wall" =
half of the time.
  I can push past if I fling the mouse through it but not if I slowly keep =
moving down.

  The direction always seems to be down when I hit a wall (so a Y offset? m=
aybe?)
  This has been happening since at least version 2.10.

  Not sure if "-alt-grab" has anything to do with it, that'd be my first
  guess.
