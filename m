Why? If we want to verify that clearing fp_status after flags are 
processed is equivalent to clearing flags before fp ops then verifying 
that the fp_status is already cleared when the current 
helper_reset_fpstatus is called should be enough to check that nothing has 
set the flags inbetween so the current reset helper would be no op. 
Therefore I thought you could put the assert there for checking this. This 
assert is for debugging and checking the change only and not meant to be 
left there otherwise we lose all the performance gain so it's easier to 
put in the current helper before removing it for this than in every fp op 
helper. What am I missing?
