What happens when it fails to load ?  Does the user get a graceful
error message or does QEMU abort ? I'd hope the former.

So this needs a bunch of special QEMU hacks in package mgmt tools
to prevent the package upgrade & cleanup later. This does not look
like a viable strategy to me.

Well there's two benefits to modular approach

 - Allow a single build to be selectively installed on a host or container
   image, such that the install disk footprint is reduced
 - Allow a faster startup such that huge RBD libraries dont slow down
   startup of VMs not using RBD disks.

Preloading the modules before upgrade doesn't have to the second benefit.
We just have to make sure the pre loading doesn't impact the VM startup
performance.

IOW, register a SIGUSR2 handler which preloads all modules it finds on
disk. Have a pre-uninstall option on the .so package that sends SIGUSR2
to all QEMU processes. The challenge of course is that signals are
async. You might suggest a QMP command, but only 1 process can have the
QMP monitor open at any time and that's libvirt. Adding a second QMP
monitor instance is possible but kind of gross for this purpose.

Another option would be to pre-load the modules during startup, but
do it asynchronously, so that its not blocking overall VM startup.
eg just before starting the mainloop, spawn a background thread to
load all remaining modules.

This will potentially degrade performance of the guest CPUs a bit,
but avoids the latency spike from being synchronous in the startup
path.

e) Don't do upgrades on a host with running VMs :-)

   Upgrades can break the running VM even ignoring this particular
   QEMU module scenario.=20

f) Simply document that if you upgrade with running VMs that some
   features like hotplug of RBD will become unavialable. Users can
   then avoid upgrades if that matters to them.
