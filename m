This is certainly caused by pip not being able to install paramiko on
those systems.  I have dealt with paramiko (and its many dependencies)
before on the avocado remote runner plugin (which is not being used
here) and it was not fun.

My personal goal was to rely on the ssh binary as an ssh client, which
should be more ubiquitous, and with that I added a simple wrapper to
Avocado:

  https://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/71.0/api/utils/avocado.utils.html#module-avocado.utils.ssh

I guess we should consider changing the (few) tests that require
paramiko to use that module instead.

My hope is that with pure Python modules in requirements.txt, failures
will be much harder to come by.  Either way, it'd be nice to improve
the venv creation, at the very least add a cleanup if it fails to
complete successfully.

As a workaround I'd suggest two things:

 1) remove paramiko from requirements.txt
 2) set the env var CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=1 before running `make
    check-acceptace` (the tests in linux_ssh_mips_malta.py check for
    that and don't run if it's set).

But, we'll need to address those failures definitely ASAP.  Anyway,
thanks for reporting it.
