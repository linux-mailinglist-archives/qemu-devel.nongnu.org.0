Yes, libvirt-gobject still exists & is used by GNOME Boxes.

Mostly this suggestion is a response to discussions elsewhere in this
thread expressing a desire for a way to do QEMU jailing natively. In
this proposal I'm describing an approach that might satisfy that desire,
while ignoring whatever exists in the current ecosystem including
libvirt.

So yes, there is clearly overlap here with libvirt, and this tool is
not an easy thing to build to a level which is feature comparable
with what libvirt offers. For this launcher to be credible I think
it would have to be something libvirt were capable of using itself
and that's a challenge. So quite possibly the libvirt embedded driver
is indeed a better bet. =20

Yes indeed.
