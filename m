Yes but it looks to me the problem is that Page Request Descriptor is 
only used when PRI is enabled. And according to ATS spec 1.1, PRI 
request is always page aligned...

I guess so since I don't find any other IOMMU that does similar check.

Yes, I've considered this. But the problem is that:

1) vhost itself can generate unaligned request (since its IOTLB doesn't 
have any alignment requirement)
2) the IOTLB miss processing in qemu doesn't do anything with ATS, we 
shortcut PCI by calling the address_space_get_iotlb_entry()

So I'm not quite sure it's worth to do that consider we don't emulate 
ATS via PCI actually :)

Yes.
