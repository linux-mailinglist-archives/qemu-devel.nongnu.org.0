Wording suggestion:

It's safer to expand the region protected by an in_flight request to 
begin in the synchronous wrapper and end after the BDRV_POLL_WHILE loop. 
  Leaving the in_flight request in the coroutine itself risks a race 
where calling qemu_coroutine_enter() may have only scheduled, rather 
than started, the coroutine, allowing some other thread a chance to not 
realize an operation is in flight.

block-status requests are complex, involving a query of different block 
driver states across the backing chain.  Let's expand only the in_flight 
section for the top bs, and keep the other sections as-is.

I'd welcome Kevin's review on my next comment, but if I'm correct, I 
think we can further add the following justification to the commit message:

Gathering block status only requires reads from the block device, and 
backing devices are typically read-only, so losing any in_flight race on 
a backing device is less likely to cause problems with concurrent 
modifications on the overall backing chain.

and again

Otherwise looks reasonable to me.  Fixing typos is trivial, so:
