I don't have any feedback unfortunately... The biggest problem with proxy is
likely it's poor performance : every request needs to go through many hops.

guest->QEMU->proxy->QEMU->guest

The motivation is security: only the proxy helper runs with privileges (we
generally don't want to run QEMU as root), the helper can chroot() and thus
prevent the guest to access anything outside the shared folder.

The Unix socket is required in order to pass open file descriptors between
QEMU and the proxy, using SCM_RIGHTS ancillary messages. There's no such
thing with TCPIP sockets.

The right thing to do would be to have the "proxy" process to directly
access the rings of the virtio-9p device (ie, vhost), so that requests
only go through:

guest->proxy->guest
