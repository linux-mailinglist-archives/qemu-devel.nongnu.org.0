Let's go for b) in the next revision.

There will still be a structure <domain>/<path> but it won't be a URI
with a scheme ("https"). The reason for keeping a structure and not
simply declaring it a unique opaque string is that it's hard to
ensure uniqueness if there is no structure. Two people might
accidentally choose the same name, so let's keep the domain and path
there.
