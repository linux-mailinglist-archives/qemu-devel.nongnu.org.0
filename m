This is nice, as some QEMU command line users may now be able to more
easily correct their command lines. So,

Reviewed-by: Andrew Jones <drjones@redhat.com>
Tested-by: Andrew Jones <drjones@redhat.com>

Although, many QEMU command line users still won't know what to do
without an explicit "Try -machine gic-version=3Dhost" hint, so that
might be nice to add too.

Also, unless our command line compatibility policy is so strict that
we can't change failing command lines (which this patch does to some
degree as it fails with a new message now), then we might as well
just probe for a working GIC version when using KVM, as old command
lines that implicitly or explicitly selected '2' never worked with
KVM on gicv3-only hosts anyway. We just have to try '2' first in
order to continue providing a gicv2 to a guests on hosts that support
both, but if that fails, then we can try '3', and if that works, then
users don't have to try and correct their command lines at all.

Thanks,
drew
