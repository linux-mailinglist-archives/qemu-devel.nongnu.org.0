Well, guests are getting this information in smbios somehow.  I don't
know what specifies that what bit of info in the smbios is host info,
but I guess it must at least be a de facto convention?

Uh.. I'm not sure about that.  I think the default is just to pass
nothing here.  The confusion is increased because this host info was
always handled at the above-libvirt (openstack) level on x86, using
explicit smbios configuration options down to libvirt and qemu.

On power we handled it in qemu, because that seemed the obvious way,
but it makes recombining them a pain.

Currently, no, it will just omit the properties.
