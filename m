Yeah fencing is good, but crashing a VM while it wasn't going to crash
is another thing, imho.  You can dump an error message if you really
like, but instead of exit() I really prefer we either still let the
old way to at least work or really fix it.

When I say "really fix it", I mean we can even start to think about
the shrinking case and how to support that for postcopy.  For example,
in the above case host_from_ram_block_offset() will return NULL then,
and the fix could be that we drop that extra page because we don't
need that any more, instead of bailing out.
