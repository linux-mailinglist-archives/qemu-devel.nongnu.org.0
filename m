I do that on later patches.  But the _final_ better name that I could
get with was "cmd_source".  cmd_src ends being arch_source.

About using qtest_initf():

- I didn't knew it's existence (O:-)
- I was considering about merning the command parts of cmd_source/target
  But arrived to the conclusion that it was more complicated to have it
  share it, that to repeat it.  But you need to look at the last patch
  to arrive to one conclusion.

Thanks, Juan.
