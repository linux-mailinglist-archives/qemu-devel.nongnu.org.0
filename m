Let's survey actual behavior of the object_property_get*():

                           return value
    function            on success  on error
    o_p_get()           true        false
    o_p_get_str()       non-null    null
    o_p_get_link()      anything    null
    o_p_get_bool()      anything    false
    o_p_get_int()       anything    -1
    o_p_get_uint()      anything    0
    o_p_get_enum()      enum value  0 or -1

object_property_get() and object_property_get_str() have a distinct
error value.  Yes, a QAPI str cannot be null.

object_property_get_enum() has *two* error values, and one of them can
also occur as success value.  This is daft.  I'll send a patch to always
return -1 on error.  Bonus: distinct error value.

object_property_get_link(), _bool(), _int(), and _uint() don't have a
distinct error value.

We'd change

    val = object_property_get_uint(obj, name, &error_abort);

to

    object_property_get_uint(obj, name, &val, &error_abort);

which is not an improvement.

Most of the ones passing NULL should probably pass &error_abort
instead.  Doesn't change the argument.
