We are not very good at documenting this distinction (and there's
some bits of it I'm not sure about either), but:
 * init cannot contain anything that might fail
 * init cannot contain anything that affects the simulation
 * init shouldn't do anything that needs explicit cleanup
   (eg memory allocation)
 * property creation has to happen in init, because properties
   are set after init but before realize

Thomas did a good blog post on this:

> - should the irq state be in vmstate?

I guess you mean the "uint32_t int_status;" field here?
If it's state that's in your device then it needs to be
in vmstate (this roughly corresponds to 'is there a flipflop
in the hardware that holds this state', though that is not
a 100% perfect guide). A 'qemu_irq' holds no state of its own,
so you cannot query it for the state of the line after migration.
So if your device model needs to be able to know that state
itself then it has to keep it in a struct field and migrate
that struct field. (For some devices the state of the outbound
interrupt line is a purely combinatorial result of some other
state: "int_output = int_status & int_mask" is a common one
where there's a "raw interrupt status" and a mask bit that
suppresses the outbound irq line. In that case the int_output
need not be in the device's state struct or migrated, because
we can just calculate it when we need it from the int_status
and int_mask state.)

> - is there a better way to do composition of classes (patch 3)?

No strong opinion. From a quick scan through of patch 3 it
didn't look obviously doing something in a suboptimal way.
