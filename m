Yep, those should go - I think Vivek likes to keep them for testing
since they make things fail more completely if there's a screwup.

Probably for cases where the data is only accessed once, and you can't
preemptively map.
Another variant on (1) is whether we could do read/writes while the mmap
is happening to absorb the latency.

I think there's two things to solve here that I don't currently know the
answer to:
  2a) We'd need to get the fd to qemu for the thing to mmap;
      we might be able to cache the fd on the qemu side for existing
      mappings, so when asking for a new mapping for an existing file then
      it would already have the fd.

  2b) Running a device with a mix of queues inside QEMU and on
      vhost-user; I don't think we have anything with that mix

Are you thinking of doing all read/writes that way, or just the corner
cases? It doesn't seem worth it for the corner cases unless you're
finding them cropping up in real work loads.

Sounds possible.

One I was thinking about that feels easier than (2) was to change the
vhost slave protocol to be split transaction; it wouldn't do anything
for the latency but it would be able to do some in parallel if we can
get the kernel to feed it.
