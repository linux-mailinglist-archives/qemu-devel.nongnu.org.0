Yes, that would make the yank command much more flexible in how it can
be used.

As an alternative to using formatted strings like this, it could be
modelled more explicitly in QAPI

  { 'struct':  'YankChannels',
    'data': { 'chardev': [ 'string' ],
              'nbd': ['string'],
	      'migration': bool } }

In this example, 'chardev' would accept a list of chardev IDs which
have it enabled, 'nbd' would accept a list of block node IDs which
have it enabled, and migration is a singleton on/off.

The benefit of this modelling is that you can introspect QEMU
to discover what classes of channels support being yanked by
this QEMU build, as well as what instances are configured to
be yanked. ie you can distinguish between a QEMU that doesn't
support yanking network devices, from a QEMU that does support
yanking network devices, but doesn't have it enabled for any
network device instances.

Daniel
