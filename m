P9_IOHDRSZ is really specific to write/read operations. 

/*
 * ample room for Twrite/Rread header
 * size[4] Tread/Twrite tag[2] fid[4] offset[8] count[4]
 */
#define P9_IOHDRSZ 24

As you see P9_IOHDRSZ is approximately the size of a Twrite header.
Its primary use is to inform the client about the 'count' to use for
Twrite/Tread messages (see get_iounit()).

Not sure it helps to mention P9_IOHDRSZ since we're going to choose
something much greater. I'd personally drop this sentence.

No message may be truncated in any way actually. The spec just allows
an exception with the string part of Rerror.

Maybe just mention that and say we choose 4096 to be able to send
big Rreadlink messages.

This last sentence isn't informative in the commit message. This
kind of indication should be added after the --- below.
