Public bug reported:

Hello QEMU devs,

I am trying to create a simulated VLAN using socket networking, and the
only way to connect multiple networks in QEMU using socket networking is
by using the multicast `mcast` option of the `socket` network backend.

However, when I try use the following arguments in QEMU to create a
multicast socket network:

`-device e1000,id=3Dsock-0 -netdev id=3Dsock-0,mcast=3D230.0.0.1:1234`

it fails with:

`can't bind ip address=3D230.0.0.1: unknown error` in my Windows host.

I would like to know if this is a bug, or if I am missing a prerequisite
before running the QEMU command.

By the way, I am using Windows 10, and running a cross-compiled QEMU
4.2.0.
