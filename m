I agree with that and I'll send an updated patch soon.

The driver should not touch the completion entries at all, but rather just scan for the entries whose
phase bit was flipped by the hardware.

in fact I don't even think that the 'c->cid' became the exit condition, but rather since the device is not allowed 
to fully fill the compleiton queue (it must alway keep at least one free entry there), the end condition would still
be the check on the flipped phase bit.


I'll fix that to be up to the spec,

Best regards,
