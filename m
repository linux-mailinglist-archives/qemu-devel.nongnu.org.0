Borderline long line, but it fits ;)

This is the second time we're grabbing the first entry in this function. 
But I don't think it's worth trying to micro-optimize.

And another place where we compute l2_entry for the first cluster twice, 
and again not worth micro-optimizing.

I didn't find anything that needs a change.
