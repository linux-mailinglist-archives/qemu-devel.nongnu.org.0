Ahhh, I see what you mean. I totally missed this subtle detail.

IIUC, there's essentially no such thing as array properties
in QOM. 'prop[0]', 'prop[1]', 'prop[2]', etc are all simply
scalar properties from QOM's, that just happen to follow a
common naming scheme, but QOM doesn't care about that.

Techically arrays are already supported at the core QOM level, because
you can use any QAPI type as a property.  The authz/list.c object
has a 'rules' property that is an array of QAuthzListRule objects:

  { 'struct': 'AuthZListProperties',
    'data': { '*policy': 'QAuthZListPolicy',
              '*rules': ['QAuthZListRule'] } }

At the time I wrote that, we couldn't express it on the CLI though,
without using JSON syntax for -object. I don't think we've ever
made it possible to use the opts_visitor with non-scalar properties
though.

With regards,
Daniel
