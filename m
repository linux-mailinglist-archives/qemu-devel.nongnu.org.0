Maybe this list is better to split your patches.

Which are the 'not used' ones?

TYPE_TPCI200 (from IndustryPack) can go with PCI.

You can put all the PrimeCell devices together (eventually with the=20
other ARM devices):

  hw/audio/pl041.c
  hw/char/pl011.c
  hw/display/pl110.c
  hw/dma/pl080.c
  hw/dma/pl330.c
  hw/gpio/pl061.c
  hw/input/pl050.c
  hw/intc/pl190.c
  hw/sd/pl181.c
  hw/ssi/pl022.c
  hw/timer/pl031.c
