Ah well that link above is actually reasonably clear:

  "More generally, when a program translates its input into 
   some other form, the copyright status of the output inherits
   that of the input it was generated from. "

In our case the input is the QAPI JSON, and we're translating that
into  Golang. That could be read as meaning our Golang code has to
be GPLv2+ licensed just as with the QAPI, not merely the docs.

With regards,
Daniel
