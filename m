Scratch that, it is actually possible to configure private runners
to pick up un-tagged jobs

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/configure_runners.html#runner-is-allowed-to-run-untagged-jobs

i'm not sure what the prioritization  is between shared and private
runners when using untagged jobs though. If a share runners will
pick up untagged jobs and then error them due to lack of CI credits
that might prevent our private runner picking up the untagged jobs.
We could turn off shared runners entirely potentially.

We would need the private runner to be configured with the docker
engine, so it can handle our container based approach.

With regards,
Daniel
