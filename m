Not inherently it just does not attempt to address this problem.


Inflight tracking only tries to address issues on the guest side,
that is, making sure the same buffer is used exactly once.

Device with any kind of atomicity guarantees will
have to use some internal mechanism (e.g. log?) to ensure
internal consistency, that is out of scope for tracking.

Well it does not eliminate it as such, it moves it to the backend.
Which in a variety of setups is actually a more sensitive
place as the backend can do things like access host
storage/network which VMM can be prevented from doing.

Architecturally, I think we can have 3 processes:


VMM -- guest device emulation -- host backend


to me this looks like increasing our defence in depth strength,
as opposed to just shifting things around ...

Yes, but does anything prevent us from further splitting the backend
up to emulation part and host side part?

Sorry I will need to go and read the doc which I didn't yet, sorry
about that.
