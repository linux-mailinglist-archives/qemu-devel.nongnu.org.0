Yes I have tested only a single version, but from the looks of it there 
is only a single IRQ in the HyperV APCI table that I have looked at, and 
I believe the one you have pasted as well in the past, so that change 
sounds reasonable to me.

As for the enlightenments dont you prefer to have all those as mandatory 
for VMBus in order not to run into the issue I have encountered?

>> With that said I did run into a small issue I set-up Win10 1903 (aka 19H1) and it seems like VMBus now requires to have the following features enabled:

That's great I agree incrementally is the right way here, should we open 
another Thread to discuss all these changes or do you prefer we will 
keep going on this one?
