Yeah :/

So, in this case Openstack already does something similar for x86 - it
passes /etc/machine-id through the smbios information.  Unfortunately
the way it passes that down to qemu is via an explicit -smbios option.

It would be nice to have a common "host-id" or whatever option to qemu
which will work for both x86 via smbios and power via device tree
and/or get-vpd.  I had a look at that, and implementing it is fiddlier
than you'd think, because all the fallback logic and multiple pieces
to change (e.g. qemu would need to populate with explicit smbios info
first, then fall back to machine options, then libvirt would need a
common way to pass it through, then openstack would need to change to
use the common way, .... ugh).

At the moment this is in my "makes-my-brain-hurt-to-contemplate"
pile.  I'm open to suggestions.
