OK, thank you, I'm fully satisfied with this addition. :)

Phil, in this case I think we can indeed replace the hard-coded "GCC5"
with a bit of dynamic detection. Two remarks:

- Please CC Ard on v2, so he can ACK. I'd like that. :)

- Again, we shouldn't blindly reapply the x86 (OVMF) quirk(s). I mean
mainly the special casing of "6.[0-2].*" to GCC49, which comes from
upstream edk2 commit 432f1d83f77a ("OvmfPkg/build.sh: Use GCC49
toolchains with GCC 6.[0-2]", 2016-12-06).

... or is that GCC bug target-independent in fact? I can't really tell;
the upstream GCC bug
<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D70955> is ISA-specific
(x86-64), and so are function calling conventions.

I'd suggest *not* applying the quirk for ArmVirtQemu, initially.

Thanks
Laszlo
