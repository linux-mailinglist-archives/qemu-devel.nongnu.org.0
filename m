OK. Does that mean you are the new responsible of updating the ticket
regarding the WHPX headers and their license?

Great! I didn't know Stefan already did it :)
Can you share the URL please, so we can integrate it with mainstream CI?

As usual, we do not want to circumvent the license. IANAL but IIUC we
can not force a CI job to accept the EULA when installing it, even to
test it. So the best we can do is check if the build succeeded (exit
status).

'master', to be sure no regressions are introduced.

You describe a "downstream CI" testing, which is out of scope of the
community public CI.

Phil.

Title:
  QEMU installer with WHPX support

Status in QEMU:
  Opinion

Bug description:
  People often ask the community to add WHPX support to the QEMU installer =
for Windows,
  but it is impossible due to the license limitations of the WHPX SDK.

  The WinHvEmulation.h and WinHvPlatform.h header files needed are "All
  rights reserved".

  However these headers only contain struct definitions and integer constan=
ts,
  no functional code in macros or inline functions. See:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg645815.html
  It is questionable whether the headers alone can be considered copyrighta=
ble material.
