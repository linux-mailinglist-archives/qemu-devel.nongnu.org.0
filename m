It's actually checked, because it loops over vtd_as_with_notifiers, and only
MAP notifiers register to that. :)

But I agree with you that it should be cleaner to introduce the dev-iotlb
notifier type.

I think it matches exactly with a hot plug case?  Note that when IOMMU_NONE
could also mean the translation does not exist.  So it's actually trying to map
everything that can be translated and then notify().

I think it's simply because memory_region_notify_one() came later. :)

I feel like that can be removed now, but needs some testings...
