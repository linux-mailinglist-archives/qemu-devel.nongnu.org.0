Yes - although it will be two queries:

  struct qemu_plugin_hwaddr *hw =3D qemu_plugin_get_hwaddr(info, vaddr);

This does the actual lookup and stores enough information for the
further queries.

  uint64_t pa =3D qemu_plugin_hwaddr_to_raddr(hw);

will return the physical address (assuming it's a RAM reference and not
some IO location).

Hmm good question. We track the hostaddr of the instructions as we load
them so we should be able to track that back to the guest physical
address. There isn't a helper for doing that yet though.

Quite. We don't want plugin authors to make any assumptions about the
internals of the TCG. It's not totally opaque because there are
translation time events where we offer the plugin a chance to instrument
individual instructions (or even a "block") which obviously exposes
there is a JIT of some sort.

Yes.

 Subject: [Qemu-devel] [RFC PATCH v2 0/7] QEMU binary instrumentation proto=

There have certainly been a lot of attempts to getting some sort of
plugin functionality into QEMU. I make no promises this one will be the
one but we shall see!

What patches did you add on top?
