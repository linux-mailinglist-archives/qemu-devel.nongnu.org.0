Do you have a link to the spec that I could look at? I am not hopeful
that this will be listed there since the poison side of QEMU was never
implemented. The flag is only here because it was copied over in the
kernel header.

The problem is this was broken from the start for that. The issue is
that the poison feature was wrapped up within the page hinting
feature. So as a result enabling it for a VM that doesn't recognize
the feature independently would likely leave the poison value
uninitialized and flagging as though a value of 0 is used. In addition
the original poison checking wasn't making sure that the page wasn't
init_on_free which has the same effect as page poisoning but isn't
page poisoning.

Right. We need to make sure any poison or init on free is migrated
over to the destination before we can say we are going to skip the
migration. If anything what I probably ought to look into would be if
we could change the code so that if we have a hint the page is unused,
poison is enabled, and the value is 0 we just ship over a 0 page
instead of giving up on hinting entirely.
