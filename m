This should be obvious, but I can add something.

I don't think we're changing the semantics of "off". We're merely fixing
a bug that happens not to exist with preallocation.

Hm... I placed the code where I did because I didn't want to make the
new area valid before it isn't zeroed. But you're probably right that
we shouldn't run requests with inconsistent bs->total_sectors, so I'll
switch the order.
