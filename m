I see. So QOM interface will still be used as a low-level interface.
In the draft version, vhost-user-blk-server is started using specific
command vhost_user_server_start/vhost_user_server_stop which proivide
interfaces easier for implementing block-export-add QMP command. But
in later versions, only object_add/object_del syntax is supported to
start/stop vhost-user-blk-server. I'll keep an eye on how the storage
daemon develops and adapt my code accordingly.
