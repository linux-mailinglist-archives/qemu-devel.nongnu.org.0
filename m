The important distinction (and in fact the only one that qed makes) is
raw and non-raw. Problems only arise if a guest can write an image
header to a raw file and get it probed as non-raw when opening the
image the next time. If you start with a non-raw format, at least the
first 512 bytes (which are used for probing) are used for metadata and
not accessible for the guest.

I think vmdk only expects vmdk as backing files, even though QEMU
supports everything else, too. However, this is a format for
compatibility with another hypervisor and you're unlikely to find
QEMU-only VMDK images, so requiring non-raw unconditionally might make
sense.

I have no idea about how backing files in Sheepdog are used in practice.
However, QEMU is a primary target for Sheepdog. It wouldn't surprise me
if it's used for both raw and non-raw.

qcow is definitely used for both, as you already said. Allowing only raw
and qcow and forbidding other formats doesn't improve the situation
because the problem is with supporting raw and non-raw at the same time
and you would still have this.

Hm... Maybe _make_test_img can insert/filter out -F depending on $IMGFMT?
