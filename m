I've tested smoe more cmbinations and found that I van have v4.2 work on fo=
cal.
Eventually I have realized that when I install start the qemu from Ubuntu n=
ot only that but also the formerly working build of v4.2.0 from git start t=
o fail (without rebuilding).

A bit of package bisect later I found seabios to be related.
Focal is at 1.13.0-1
Eoan is at 1.12.0-1

After I knew that I verified and found it really only triggers on
seabios 1.13.0.

With 1.13 I was also able to break the qemu v4.0.0 git build on eoan.
As well as the packaged qemu in Eoan.

So it seems we are actually looking for a problem of seabios (instead of
qemu) with the Penryn chip.

I'll look at their changelog and bisect that tomorrow as time permits

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
