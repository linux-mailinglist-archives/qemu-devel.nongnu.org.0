Yes, it could be any unique string. If the URI idea is not popular we
can use any similar scheme.

Can you think of an example that has only one option?

I tried but couldn't. For example take a sound card. The guest is aware
the device supports stereo playback (2 output channels), but which exact
stereo host device is used doesn't matter, they are all suitable.

Now imagine migrating to a 7.1 surround-sound device. Similar options
come into play:

a) Emulate stereo and mix it to 7.1 surround-sound on the physical
   device. The guest still sees the stereo device.

b) Refuse migration.

c) Indicate that the output has switched and let the guest reconfigure
   itself (e.g. a sound card with multiple outputs, where one of them is
   stereo and another is 7.1 surround sound).

Which option is desirable depends on the use case.

version=3D1 does not explicitly set rx-filter-size=3D0. When a new paramete=
r
is introduced it must have a default value that disables its effect on
the hardware interface and/or device state representation. This is
described in a bit more detail in the next section, maybe it should be
reordered.

Sounds like a good idea.

Can these cases be handled by adding additional configuration parameters?

If version=3D1 is lacks essential state then version=3D2 can add it. The
user must configure the device to use version before they can save the
full state.

If version=3D1 didn't handle the X=3D5 case then the same solution is
needed. A new configuration parameter is introduced and the user needs
to configure the device to be the new version before migrating.

Unfortunately this requires poweroff or hotplugging a new device
instance. But some disruption is probably necessarily anyway so the
migration code on the host side can be patched to use the updated device
state representation.

The easy way to handle that without lots of metadata is by instantiating
the destination device to see if it works.

But in the next point you mention cloud where we need a way to find a
host that supports a given device. Metadata is probably needed to make
that check easy. In the email reply to Daniel Berrange I posted the
beginning of a JSON schema that describes device models for this
purpose. I think that offers a solution for the cloud case.
