I don't know that code well; but I think the answer is that since the
queues themselves are in guest memory, the guest memory is migrated
by the normal migration code and so the queues version of last_avail_idx
should be correct.  The 'log' mechanism I previously mentioned will
need to make sure the queue pages are marked dirty to make sure these
are updated correctly.
