Public bug reported:

QEMU 5.0.0, built with ./configure --target-list=3Dx86_64-softmmu
--enable-debug --disable-strip --disable-docs --disable-sdl

Running on a headless host (Ryzen 3600), Arch Linux, 64bit latest.
Guest is also Arch Linux, 64bit.

Started with qemu-system-x86_64 -vnc 0.0.0.0:0 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -cpu hos=
t -smp cores=3D2,threads=3D1,sockets=3D1 -machine q35 -vga std -device
 ich9-ahci,id=3Dahci -drive file=3Dvm0.qcow2,format=3Dqcow2,if=3Dnone,id=3D=
dsk0 -device ide-hd,drive=3Ddsk0,bus=3Dahci.0 -soundhw hda

So, a headless VM is running on a server and is being connected to over
VNC. The virtual sound card is detected and speaker test is running
inside the VM. So far so good.

Then, i tell the VNC client to enable audio (QEMU Audio Client Message,
255,1,0). QEMU responds with a "stream is about to start" message (QEMU
Audio Server Message, 255,1,1) and then promptly crashes without sending
anything else.

Running it in GDB produces a crash at audio/audio.c:739

Thread 1 "qemu-system-x86" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
audio_pcm_sw_write (sw=3D0x5555575bbf30, buf=3D0x0, size=3D1628) at audio/a=
udio.c:739
739             if (!sw->hw->pcm_ops->volume_out) {

The exact sequence of events does not matter - i can enable sound before
playing anything, and then it would say nothing and keep working, but
crash with the same message once anything sound-playing is launched in
the VM.

Using different soundhw or adding various audiodev options does not seem
to affect anything.

I can't quite figure out if the QEMU Audio VNC extension is supposed to
work at all or not, but it would be handy to me if it is.
