The kernel and device should always do the right thing, we cannot rely
on the user to honor the mapping, but it's also a reasonable response
from the kernel to kill the process with a SIGSEGV if the user ignores
the protections.  So I don't think it's an either/or, the kernel needs
to do the right thing for itself and in this case QEMU should do the
right thing for itself, which is to drop writes for regions that don't
support it.  So in general, I agree with your patch.

What the device chooses to do with writes to a BAR is its own business,
the PCI spec shouldn't try to define that.  There's also no PCI spec
mechanism to declare the access protections for an entire BAR, that's
device specific behavior.  The current QEMU vfio-pci behavior is
therefore somewhat implicit in knowing this for a directly assigned
device.  We can mmap the device and we expect writes to unwritable
registers within that mapping to be dropped.

For an mdev device, we can't rely on the user honoring the access
protections, ie. the user shouldn't be able to exploit the kernel or
device by doing so, but I also agree that QEMU, as a friendly vfio
user, should avoid unsupported operations and protect itself from how
the kernel may handle the fault.

Since this mdev device doesn't exist yet, I'm thinking this is QEMU
v5.1 material though.

Yes.  Thanks,
