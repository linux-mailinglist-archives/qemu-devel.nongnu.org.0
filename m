Well HMP as a whole is considered non-stable, so we don't need to call
out individual things. We've got a simple story that QMP == stable,
HMP == unstable.

The comparison here would be if we declared the entire QEMU CLI to be
unstable, except for JSON syntax args.

Bearing in mind our previous discussions it feels like our goal is that
we're tending towards a world where we are only wanting to consider
JSON based configuration to be stable, and everything else non-stable.

I think that's a good long term plan, but if we're really doing that
then I think we need to big picture explain it in our docs rather
than mention it in passing against individual args.

BTW I'm also not a fan of deprecating stuff when our documentation is
still using the deprecated syntax and nothing shows the new preferred
syntax. We've got alot of results for  $ git grep -- ' -object'

Daniel
