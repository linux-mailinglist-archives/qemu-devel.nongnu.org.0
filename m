Google search "latent software BUG"

Hit 1: What I posted


Hit 2:
https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-for-a-latent-defect-in-softwar=
e-testing

"The problems will not cause the damage currently, but wait to reveal
themselves at a later time. ... E.g. February has 28 days. ... These
defects do not cause damage to the system immediately but wait for a
particular event sometime to cause damage and show their presence."

"Mostly, these types of bugs are unexpected outcome of any corner/edge
case scenarios which was executed with some specific set of test data."


Hit 3: https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/9170/what-is-a-latent-bug

"Latent bugs are bugs which exist, but have not yet been discovered.

They are bugs waiting to be found."

"In Software Quality Assurance:

Latent defects are the those which arises in the field, and unknown
until they reported by the field staff."


Hit 4:
https://sqa.stackexchange.com/questions/13980/what-is-the-difference-betwee=

"A latent bug is a bug which is present in the system from previous
iterations or release (in your scenario Sprint 1). They are either low
priority bugs, which either went undetected or were not reported."


Same at least for Hit 5, 6, 7 (then I got tired ;) )

Which contain perfect examples and descriptions for latent bugs :)

e.g.,

"Let=E2=80=99s imagine that an application is able to print a document eith=
er by
laser printer or by dot matrix printer. To reach this, the application
first searches for the laser printer. In this case if it finds a laser
printer (used by default) it uses this one and prints. In case if it
does not find a laser printer, the application searches for dot matrix
printer. And if the application finds a dot matrix printer, it  gives an
error message. This unleashes a latent defect. Therefore this
application will never search for the dot matrix printer. And the
application never got tested for the dot matrix printer. That means the
accurate conditions were never met for the dot matrix printer. This is
what we call a latent software bug."

A "BUG that cannot be triggered" is an oxymoron. :)

The code might be "error prone", it might "violate API guidelines", it
might "not obey coding practices". If it can't be triggered, it's - by
definition - not a (latent) BUG.

In general, I don't care about these minor details, but if somebody
literally tells the world for all eternity in a handful of patch
descriptions "David messed up the code by introducing a (latent) BUG
(that cannot be triggered)" I get suspicious. Something nicer (IMHO)
would be "Commit X introduced error prone code, let's rework that to
make it more stable in the future and obey the "error API" guidelines. I
hope you see the difference ;)
