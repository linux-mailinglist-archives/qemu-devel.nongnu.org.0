Hi Peter, Michael,

Have we come to conclusion on how to submit patches for ARM ACPI tables?

Some rough thoughts: is it possible to use the disassembled ASL file as=20
the 'golden master' data? One problem I can imagine is that this may=20
introduce dependency on the version of iASL tool. If so, how about=20
adding acpica source code as a submodule, just like what we did for the=20
device tree compile "dtc".

There may be much more which I missed; looking forward to your comments.

Thanks,

Heyi
