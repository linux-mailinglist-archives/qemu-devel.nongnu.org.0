I don't think dropping the serial port output is an acceptable outcome.

If someone decides to log their console with something that is very slow
(because they decide to carve every bit of it into stone), it shouldn't
be QEMU's decision to just give up on it. Specially if the console is
over TCP, which garantees no loss of data. Someone wanting to have the
behaviour you describe would probably use UDP as the transport protocol
and deal with the consequences.

Similarly, QEMU doesn't drop data on the floor when a write to a disk
image that results in a block allocation fails because the host 
filesystem
is full.

Thanks,
