If there's a concern that this will break non-Linux OSes on arm, then, at
most, the change needs to be tied to the next machine type version, and
possibly it can never be made for arm. riscv is OK, since it currently
ignores smp parameters anyway. It currently derives the number of sockets
from the number of NUMA nodes, using a 1:1 mapping. When smp parameters
are eventually implemented for riscv, then this can be revisited.

Also, it sounds like not only has the rationale for this series been
changed to "platform choice", but also that the cluster <-> numa node
mapping should be 1:1, not the socket <-> numa node mapping. If that's
the case, then the series probably needs to be reworked for that.

Thanks,
