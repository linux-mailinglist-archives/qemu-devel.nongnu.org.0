I had less than a "now and over next month" (>7 weeks!) in mind.

The choice of deadline is really about how much of Paolo's time we are
(and he is!) willing to spend on rebasing vs. how much risk of toothing
problems in master we are willing to accept.

"First thing after 5.2 opens" would be ideal from a "avoid more
rebasing" point of view, but it may not be practical.

Once the flood gates are open, we can probably just as well wait for the
initial flood to subside.

Yup.  If you want it not to break in master, get it tested in our gating
CI.
