Why would it let the reopen fail? Failing would be justifiable, but I
expect it just succeeds without updating the options of the child node.

An explicitly created filter node that is inserted with blockdev-reopen
certainly doesn't inherit from its parent. An automatically created
filter node where you didn't have control of its options - hm... good
question.

If we want to keep it simple, maybe it would be defensible if we just
break the inheritance relationship as soon as the parent is detached
(i.e. when inserting the filter). At least that would be more consistent
than silently disabling option inheritance while a filter is present and
then suddenly reenabling it when the filter goes away.


The other option would be making it actually work, i.e. the child node
keeps inheriting from its original parent node. This would not only
require modifications to bdrv_reopen(), but also to the data structures
so that the parent has a list of nodes that inherit from it: Nobody can
even guarantee that the child node always stays in the subtree of the
original parent.

This is in fact a reason why this patch isn't only ugly, but actually
wrong - you may still miss some inherits_from references.
