As long as we can keep the compatibility code local to qmp_nbd_*(), I
don't think it's too bad. In particular because it's already written.

Instead of adjusting libvirt to changes in the nbd-* commands, I'd
rather have it change over to block-export-*. I would like to see the
nbd-server-add/remove commands deprecated soon after we have the
replacements.

How about deprecating nbd-server-add completely?

Yes, seems so. It's the existing behaviour, I'm only moving the code
around.

If nbd-server-add will be going away relatively soon, it's probably not
worth the trouble. But if you have reasons to keep it, maybe we should
consider it.
