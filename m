I think our alternatives are ensuring no bitmaps are in memory so that 
reloading the RO bitmap from the file succeeds (which then hits the 
earlier question about whether releasing ALL bitmaps affects libvirt's 
ability to query which bitmaps were on the source, but makes reloading 
on the destination easy), or teaching the reload to special-case a RO 
bitmap from the disk that is already in memory (either to make the 
reload a graceful no-op instead of an error that it was already loaded, 
or to go one step further and validate whether the contents in memory 
match the contents reloaded from disk).  If I understand your patch, you 
went with the first of these alternatives.  And since Peter was able to 
test that it fixed the libvirt scenario, I'm okay with the approach you 
took, although I would love a second opinion from Virtuozzo folks.

Moving the label was an interesting change; I had to look at the file in 
context to see the real effect: basically, you now reach the line:

bdrv_release_dirty_bitmap(bm->dirty_bitmap);

for the set of persistent RO bitmaps that were previously ignored.
