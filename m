It is actually.  What you are describing is how the forwarding headers
work: they include trace.h from the including file's directory.  In the
current mechanism, instead, trace.h is found thanks to
"-I$(BUILD_DIR)/$(@D)".  That is, it comes from the build-directory
homologue of the including file's directory.

That is currently a problem.  I haven't checked if it is fixable by
creating a meson.build file for each trace-events directory (which we
would have sooner or later, but not yet).  It probably would be fixable,
but the lack of a "-I$(BUILD_DIR)/$(@D)" equivalent in the include path
would still be an issue.

This is not a problem for the generated QAPI headers, because those are
included as "qapi/whatever.h".  Similarly, the trace.h forwarding
headers include the generated files as "trace/trace-whatever.h".

Yep, in a final patch I would first introduce the forwarding headers in
the current Make environment.

It's because, with the disappearance of trace-obj-y, there's no
recursion into trace/ except for "obj-y += control-target.o" (which is
only processed in the *-softmmu and *-linux-user directories).

I completely ignored tests/Makefile.include.

Yup, side effects of going through the build system with a finer comb
than usual.

For crypto/Makefile.objs I'm replacing libqemuutil.a with Boolean logic.
 Yet more material for a separate patch, as you suggest below.

Of course.

Not yet.  But once I have all the meson.build files I could do

trace_events_files += [meson.current_source_dir()]

in all of them.  For now, adding 60 subdir files just for the sake of
that line is more confusing than helpful.

Yes: getting rid of config-host.mak completely, and rewriting configure
in meson as well (configure would remain just for command line processing).

You won't find much functional style I'm afraid, since Meson doesn't
have generators or something like any() or all().  +1 for Make here,
especially once you've gotten used to the $() syntax. :)

Not entirely true.  There are no "when:" thingies in trace_obj because
everything ends up in a static library, so that the required object
files are chosen by the linker.

The trace_events_subdirs conditionals are a recent addition:

    commit 5b4a969a701fd298be7bb9a916f8918200cdd827
    Author: Laurent Vivier <lvivier@redhat.com>
    Date:   Mon Apr 1 16:12:18 2019 +0200

    trace: only include trace-event-subdirs when they are needed

    Some directories are built only for softmmu targets,
    and the related trace-event-subdirs must do the same

where the commit message really should have said "can" do the same.  It
saves a little bit of compilation time.

Gotcha.  It's harmless but a bit on the ugly side.  My preferred fix
here would be to add a FIXME to qapi/meson.build, and removing it after
common_obj becomes a thing.

The philosophical question is whether Make should know about git or not.
 I'm more on the side of "or not", I like my build systems to be
self-contained and introspectable.

Not really.  One possibility could be something like

  qapi_module_outputs = [
    'qapi-types-@0@.c'.format(module),
    'qapi-types-@0@.h'.format(module),
    'qapi-visit-@0@.c'.format(module),

    'qapi-events-@0@.c'.format(module),
    'qapi-events-@0@.h'.format(module),
  ]
  qmp_module_outputs = [
    'qapi-commands-@0@.c'.format(module),
    'qapi-commands-@0@.h'.format(module),
  ]
  qapi_inputs += [ files(module + '.json') ]
  if qapi_common_modules.contains(module)
    qapi_util_outputs += qapi_module_outputs
    qapi_common_outputs += qmp_module_outputs
  else
    qapi_target_outputs += qapi_module_outputs + qmp_module_outputs
  endif

...
  qapi_all_outputs = qapi_util_outputs + qapi_common_outputs \
      + qapi_target_outputs
...
  # The order of these foreach statements must match the earlier
  # assignment to qapi_all_outputs, because...
  i = 0
  foreach output : qapi_util_outputs

To trigger Meson's magic interpretation of the "#! /usr/bin/env python3"
shebang, to "call the script with the python interpreter that was used
to invoke Meson".  In turn, that python interpreter is the one that was
passed to --python.

That is of course why it is included in this patch, not why it belongs
to this patch.  Just like a bunch of things we're discovering along the
way we should do it now, and then it will just work when converting to
Meson.

Yes, Meson has this approach of "non-Turing complete imperative" that is
debatable.  It certainly favors a Python-like "there is only one way to
do it" style and discourages magic, but other times "a bit sad" is an
accurate description.

Yes, though this may be the fixable part (the likely unfixable part is
-I$(BUILD_DIR)/$(@D), after which this other issue becomes moot).

Until now, debugging wasn't an issue.  All snags we encountered could
have happened anyway with Make, they obviously didn't happen with the
current Makefiles through happy accidents.

But, I'll be able to tell you more once I encounter paper cuts (and I
surely will).  We'll see how easy it is to debug them and fix them.

I hope my remarks gives you a feeling for the constraints I am encountering.

In the words of Marc-André, the conversion does leave a bitter feeling
here and there.  With Make you have great power and great
responsibility, and it's easier to abuse both.  With Meson you have
little power and thus less responsibility; the better data structures
are a pleasure to work with, but sometimes you miss the power and just
want to scream.

The silver lining is that meson is very good at reporting errors early,
so until now I mostly screamed at it and not at ninja.  (The exception
is the issue I reported in the cover letter, but I promise it'll be fixed!).

Agreed.  Marc-André has converted qemu-ga already, and check-unit could
