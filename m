The real issue is there have been so many patches flying around for
this, it's not clear exactly what combination needed to be tested.  Dov
found the branch in tags/for_upstream but it's still failing measured 
direct boot, although the failure has shifted from the hash check of
the kernel to the hash check of the command line.

All I really wanted was a link to the patch ... I don't need the tree
because inspection will tell me that it adds unexpected data at the end
of an integrity checked file.

OK, so the problem is still the same as it was before: adding
unexpected data to an integrity checked file.

I don't get why there's all this dancing around trying to find space. 
Surely when the parameter was added, since it was a fixed size, the
kernel header was expanded and the boot protocol version bumped?  So we
can use that to identify kernels which can use this property and have
the space to insert it directly.
