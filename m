I generally agree with what you are saying. I know that x86 includes
seabios (although I'm not sure how) and maybe that is something we can
look at. There is now a default RISC-V firmware which would be useful
to include so that users can just boot their kernel. We would have to
make sure it's possible to overwrite this default one so that people
can test their own.

The hard part becomes building the firmware as we don't expect people
to have a RISC-V toolchain installed.

I think the best bet here is to look at what x86 does for their BIOS
and we can start to move towards that.
