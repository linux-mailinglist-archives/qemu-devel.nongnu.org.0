There was one time when edk2 core modules gained a feature for marking
the DXE phase stack non-executable. We happily enabled it in OVMF. Then
people reported that UEFI grub in their old Debian guests had broken --
on their hosts carrying OVMF binaries built from upstream. :) We had to
flip the default off in OVMF, and we've stuck with that ever since...
