Yes, this is something we can consider.

Currently, we normalize away the '*' prefix when we go from the abstract
parse tree (which we call "expressions") to the internal representation:

    def _make_member(self, name, typ, ifcond, info):
        optional =3D False
        if name.startswith('*'):
            name =3D name[1:]
            optional =3D True
        if isinstance(typ, list):
            assert len(typ) =3D=3D 1
            typ =3D self._make_array_type(typ[0], info)
        return QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember(name, info, typ, optional, ifcond=
)

This keeps the normalization internal.

Other normalizations we perform on the abstract parse tree.  For
instance, here's the one that normalizes shorthand member "'KEY': 'ARG'"
to longhand "'KEY': { 'type': 'ARG' }":

    def normalize_members(members):
        if isinstance(members, OrderedDict):
            for key, arg in members.items():
                if isinstance(arg, dict):
                    continue
                members[key] =3D {'type': arg}

For these normalizations, both the shorthand and the longhand form are
part of the schema language.  We could do the same for '*'.

Introspection has the true member name, without the '*' prefix.

We'll also want to avoid unnecessary compromises on QAPI schema
expressiveness.  If we use null to mean "schema does not specify
behavior when member is absent", we can't use it to mean "absent member
behaves like the value null".  A bit of a blemish, but I think it's a
tolerable one.

I believe both

    '*KEY': { 'type': ARG': 'default': null }

and

    'KEY': { 'type': ARG': 'default': null }

are viable longhand forms for '*KEY': 'ARG'.

I prefer the latter, but I'm open to arguments.
