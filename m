Two questions: (1) why does it break here, and (2) why doesn't it break
elsewhere.

First question: why does it break here?

It breaks here because asking for help with "device_add mac_via,help"
has a side effect visible in "info qtree".

>> Here is the output:
>>
>> # Testing device 'mac_via'
[Uninteresting stuff snipped...]

"info qtree" before asking for help:

>> qtree_start: bus: main-system-bus
>>   type System

"info qtree" after asking for help:

>> qtree_end: bus: main-system-bus
>>   type System

How come?

"device_add mac_via,help" shows properties of device "mac_via".  It does
so even though "mac_via" is not available with device_add.  Useful
because "info qtree" shows properties for such devices.

These properties are defined dynamically, either for the instance
(traditional) or the class.  The former typically happens in QOM
TypeInfo method .instance_init(), the latter in .class_init().

"Typically", because properties can be added elsewhere, too.  In
particular, QOM properties not meant for device_add are often created in
DeviceClass method .realize().  More on that below.

To make properties created in .instance_init() visible in help, we need
to create and destroy an instance.  This must be free of observable side
effects.

This has been such a fertile source of crashes that I added
device-introspect-test:

Author: Markus Armbruster <armbru@redhat.com>

    device-introspect-test: New, covering device introspection
   =20
    The test doesn't check that the output makes any sense, only that QEMU
    survives.  Useful since we've had an astounding number of crash bugs
    around there.
   =20
    In fact, we have a bunch of them right now: a few devices crash or
    hang, and some leave dangling pointers behind.  The test skips testing
    the broken parts.  The next commits will fix them up, and drop the
    skipping.

Now let's examine device "mac_via".  It defines properties both in its
.class_init() and its .instance_init().

    static void mac_via_class_init(ObjectClass *oc, void *data)
    {
        DeviceClass *dc =3D DEVICE_CLASS(oc);

        dc->realize =3D mac_via_realize;
        dc->reset =3D mac_via_reset;
        dc->vmsd =3D &vmstate_mac_via;
--->    device_class_set_props(dc, mac_via_properties);
    }

where

    static Property mac_via_properties[] =3D {
        DEFINE_PROP_DRIVE("drive", MacVIAState, blk),
        DEFINE_PROP_END_OF_LIST(),
    };

And

    static void mac_via_init(Object *obj)
    {
        SysBusDevice *sbd =3D SYS_BUS_DEVICE(obj);
        MacVIAState *m =3D MAC_VIA(obj);
        MOS6522State *ms;

        /* MMIO */
        memory_region_init(&m->mmio, obj, "mac-via", 2 * VIA_SIZE);
        sysbus_init_mmio(sbd, &m->mmio);

        memory_region_init_io(&m->via1mem, obj, &mos6522_q800_via1_ops,
                              &m->mos6522_via1, "via1", VIA_SIZE);
        memory_region_add_subregion(&m->mmio, 0x0, &m->via1mem);

        memory_region_init_io(&m->via2mem, obj, &mos6522_q800_via2_ops,
                              &m->mos6522_via2, "via2", VIA_SIZE);
        memory_region_add_subregion(&m->mmio, VIA_SIZE, &m->via2mem);

        /* ADB */
        qbus_create_inplace((BusState *)&m->adb_bus, sizeof(m->adb_bus),
                            TYPE_ADB_BUS, DEVICE(obj), "adb.0");

        /* Init VIAs 1 and 2 */
        sysbus_init_child_obj(OBJECT(m), "via1", &m->mos6522_via1,
                              sizeof(m->mos6522_via1), TYPE_MOS6522_Q800_VI=
A1);
        sysbus_init_child_obj(OBJECT(m), "via2", &m->mos6522_via2,
                              sizeof(m->mos6522_via2), TYPE_MOS6522_Q800_VI=
A2);

        /* Pass through mos6522 output IRQs */
        ms =3D MOS6522(&m->mos6522_via1);
        object_property_add_alias(OBJECT(m), "irq[0]", OBJECT(ms),
                                  SYSBUS_DEVICE_GPIO_IRQ "[0]", &error_abor=
t);
        ms =3D MOS6522(&m->mos6522_via2);
        object_property_add_alias(OBJECT(m), "irq[1]", OBJECT(ms),
                                  SYSBUS_DEVICE_GPIO_IRQ "[0]", &error_abor=
t);
    }

Resulting help:

  adb.0=3D<child<apple-desktop-bus>>
  drive=3D<str>            - Node name or ID of a block device to use as a =
backend
  irq[0]=3D<link<irq>>
  irq[1]=3D<link<irq>>
  mac-via[0]=3D<child<qemu:memory-region>>
  via1=3D<child<mos6522-q800-via1>>
  via1[0]=3D<child<qemu:memory-region>>
  via2=3D<child<mos6522-q800-via2>>
  via2[0]=3D<child<qemu:memory-region>>

Observe that mac_via_init() has obvious side effects.  In particular, it
creates two devices that are then visible in "info qtree", and that's
caught by device-introspect-test.

I believe these things need to be done in .realize().


Second question: why doesn't it break elsewhere?

We have >200 calls of sysbus_init_child_obj() in some 40 files.  I'm
arbitrarily picking hw/arm/allwinner-a10.c for a closer look.

It calls it from device allwinner-a10's .instance_init() method
aw_a10_init().  Side effect, clearly wrong.

But why doesn't it break device-introspect-test?  allwinner-a10 is a
direct sub-type of TYPE_DEVICE.  Neither "info qtree" nor "info
qom-tree" know how to show these.

Perhaps the side effect is visible if I peek into QOM with just the
right qom-list command.  Tell me, and I'll try to tighten
device-introspect-test accordingly.


Root cause of this issue: nobody knows how to use QOM correctly (first
order approximation).  In particular, people are perenially confused on
how to split work between .instance_init() and .realize().  We really,
really, really need to provide some guidance there!  Right now, all we
provide are hundreds of examples, many of them bad.
