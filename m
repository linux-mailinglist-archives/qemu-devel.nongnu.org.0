The vhost-user problem is worse than that.

Lets ignore the synic regions for a minute;  imagine a normal PC,
0-512k ish, and a 512k-1GB map; the client side can do the alignment
to allow an mmap to work for each of those two mappings, you then
end up with two mmap's on the client, both aligned at 0, each covering
part of the same range.  If the client is careful in normal use it can
make sure it's OK, but you do end up with two mappings which is odd.
Once you add userfault for psotcopy, having those two mappings of the same
range gets even more problematic when we wait for one of the pages
to become available.

The other problem is that there's a limited number of slots for mappings
in the vhost-user protocol; and they easily get filled up if you
break up the memory ranges.

Doing the aggregation on the qemu side keeps your slot usage down and
also removes the problem of the double mappings.

The client can't easily resolve the double mapping alignment because it
can't tell if the two fd's it's been passed actually refer to the
same backing file; so it can't aggregate (from memory).
