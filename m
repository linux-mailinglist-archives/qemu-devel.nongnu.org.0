Looks like you didn't realize that "revert" was meant literally.  Git has a
revert subcommand, i.e. you can simply run "git revert de3f7de7f4e257" to
create a commit undoing the changes, with a commit message saying so.  The
generated text should be left intact, to make the job for tools analyzing g=
it
commits easier.  The commit message (for reverts typically explaining why t=
he
reverted commit was buggy) can go below the generated text.

Also note that only the patch commit messages end up in the commit log, the
cover letter text doesn't.  So any important details should (also) be in th=
e
commit messages so they are recorded in the log.

Reworked the commit message, looks like this now:

commit 0780ec7be82dd4781e9fd216b5d99a125882ff5a (HEAD -> queue/ui)
Author: Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel@redhat.com>

    Revert "vnc: allow fall back to RAW encoding"
   =20
    This reverts commit de3f7de7f4e257ce44cdabb90f5f17ee99624557.
   =20
    Remove VNC optimization to reencode framebuffer update as raw if it's
    smaller than the default encoding.
   =20
    QEMU's implementation was naive and didn't account for the ZLIB z_strea=
m
    mutating with each compression.  Because of the mutation, simply
    resetting the output buffer's offset wasn't sufficient to "rewind" the
    operation.  The mutated z_stream would generate future zlib blocks whic=
h
    referred to symbols in past blocks which weren't sent.  This would lead
    to artifacting.
   =20
    Considering that ZRLE is never larger than raw and even though ZLIB can
    occasionally be fractionally larger than raw, the overhead of
    implementing this optimization correctly isn't worth it.

Modified patch queued up.
Patch 2/2 is fine as-is.
