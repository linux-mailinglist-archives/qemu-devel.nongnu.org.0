Hm, ok, I guess that makes it a pretty promising approach.  Maybe for
another day though.  In the meantime I've come up with an approach
that's not totally elegant, but it does remove the duplication of the
paths for xics vs. xive, keep the individual pointers in the structure
for now, and isn't *too* verbose.

I've stripped your R-b due to the change, so please have a look in the
next spin.
