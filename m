I vaguely recall there was an option to tell linux to scan all slots,
not just slot 0, not sure if that's applicable here.

If a configuration is a permissible per the hardware design / spec, then
QEMU should generally allow it.  We don't want to constrain host side
configs based on the current limitations of guest OS whose behaviour can
change over time, or where a different guest OS may have a different POV.
