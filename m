Right. I merged the hinting support in Linux on the hope that
spec and qemu upstream will surface later. It seemed so
since IIRC there were some drafts (even though I don't
have any links to hand). Unfortunately neither happened.

I think it's an informational field. Knowing that free pages
are full of a specific pattern can be handy for the hypervisor
for a variety of reasons. E.g. compression/deduplication?

ATM, in this case driver calls "free" and that fills page with the
poison value.

It might be a valid optimization to allow driver to skip
poisoning of freed pages in this case.

Right. I think we should require that this can only be changed
before features have been negotiated.
That is the only point where hypervisor can still fail
gracefully (i.e. fail FEATURES_OK).

Probably yes, for things like kexec.
