Actually, between that and Paolo's suggestions, I thought of another
idea that could be helpful for both s390 and power.  Could we load
non-kexec() things (legacy kernels, non-Linux OSes) from Petitboot by
having it kexec() into a shim mini-kernel that just sets up the boot
environment for the other thing.

What I'm imagining is that petitboot loads everything that will be
needed for the other OS into RAM - probably as (or part of) the
"initrd" image.  That means the shim doesn't need to have drivers or
a network stack to load that in.  It just needs to construct
environment and jump into the real kernel.
