Hi,

This series adds an UUID validation at the start of the migration
on the target side. The idea is to identify the source of migration.

Possible case of problem:
1. There are 3 servers: A, B and C
2. Server A has a VM 1, server B has a VM 2
3. VM 1 and VM 2 want to migrate to the server C
4. Target of VM 1 starts on the server C and dies too quickly for some re=
ason
5. Target of VM 2 starts just after that and listen the same tcp port X, =
which
   the target of VM 1 wanted to use
6. Source of VM 1 connects to the tcp port X, and migrates to VM 2 source
7. It's possible that migration might be successful (e.g., devices are th=
e same)
8. So, the target of VM 2 is in undefined state

The series adds a capability to prevent successful (by mistake) migration=
.

The new capability x-validate-uuid only affects the source so that it sen=
ds
its UUID to the target. The target will validate the received UUID and st=
op
the migration if UUIDs are not equal.

Regards,
Yury
