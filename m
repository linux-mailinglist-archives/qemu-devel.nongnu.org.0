Hi,

The current screamer-enabled builds for OSX and Windows are on
www.emaculation.com ;-)
As you see from testing, there are reasons why the patches from Mark's
screamer branch are not in master yet, and these have not all been
addressed. There still needs to be testing on Linux and certainly on
Windows builds, and from what I mentioned above that might not be plain
sailing.
I guess I'll wait with providing new builds when the patches for both
openbios and qemu are reviewed and in some repo from which I can build
easily.

Best,
Howard

Thank you for such a detailed testing of my screamer patch. Your tests show=
 it is an improvement over the older screamer implementation :)<br>
<br>
I&#39;m hoping the maintainer will review my patch soon. I haven&#39;t hear=
d a thing from him since late December. I thinking either he does not have =
the time to review my patch or he does not want to see his patch be replace=
d with mine. <br>
<br>
For the binaries of QEMU you provide on <a href=3D"http://emaculation.net" =
rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">emaculation.net</a>, would you say it =
is time to replace the old screamer builds with this patch? <br></blockquot=
e><div><br></div><div>Hi,</div><div><br></div><div>The current screamer-ena=
bled builds for OSX and Windows are on <a href=3D"http://www.emaculation.co=
m">www.emaculation.com</a> ;-)</div><div>As you see from testing, there are=
 reasons why the patches from Mark&#39;s screamer branch are not in master =
yet, and these have not all been addressed. There still needs to be testing=
 on Linux and certainly on Windows builds, and from what I mentioned above =
that might not be plain sailing. <br></div><div>I guess I&#39;ll wait with =
providing new builds when the patches for both openbios and qemu are review=
ed and in some repo from which I can build easily. </div><div><br></div><di=
v>Best,</div><div>Howard<br></div></div></div>
