Hi Daniel,

I see there has been a discussion on this topic. And as no-op has no 
harmfulness for current implementation.
However, I still think we should make misa writable as default, which is 
also a valid spec implementation.

One reason is that may be we need to dynamic write  access for some cpus 
in the future. The other is we should
make QEMU a more useful implementation, not just a legal implementation. 
We have done in many aspects on this direction.

I prefer your implementation before v4. It's not a complicated 
implementation. And I think the other extensions on QEMU currently
can mostly be configurable already.

Your work is a good step towards to unify the configuration and the 
check.  I think two more steps we can go further.

1) Remove RVI/RVF and the similar macros, and add fields for them in the 
configuration struct.

2) Unify the check about configuration. write_misa and cpu_realize_fn 
can use the same check function.


As we have done these two steps, I think we can go more closely for the 
profile extension.
