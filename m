The idea is to avoid having to model also a platform device with
platform discovery mechanism. Based on our experiences with providing a
generic virtual PCI host controller, such a complication of
specification and implementation is simply not needed.

This device is not only a virtio transport. As you correctly point out,
it is a foundation for communication, not the full solution by itself.

Its goal is to define the minimal piece that a hypervisor has to provide
to its guests in order to enable them building full communication
solutions of their preferred flavor on top. It does not want to deal
with those details, may they be virtio, may they be something much
simpler, much older or much more sophisticated (or complicated). All
that shall not be the business of a hypervisor.

Platforms without support for MSI-X injection. Quite a few current ARM
platforms still fall into this category, but they get less, indeed.

Maybe worth to look into this again, specifically when we are done with
ITS emulation on the Jailhouse side. Maybe it will be the same story as
with our virtual PCI host controller there: After we had to add PCI
logic for devices with real controller anyway, the virtual one was
literally for free (not a single line of code added).

With that new, separate device IT, this register will start at 0 in the
next revision of this document.

I know. But using that scheme would needlessly wast 8 bits for protocol
ID encoding. In turn, having the protocol encoded into the class code
helps a lot with automatic driver probing on Linux e.g.

Faster VM exit handling. But, granted, that was not exploited so far in
existing implementations. I just wanted to keep that door open.

64-bit resource regions always use two BARs, see PCI spec.

Same story as with virtio: This should encode the ID of the provider
(hypervisor), also for the case we ever face deviating implementations,
due to quirks of specification vagueness.

All known. This shall just "encourage" to provide more powerfull MSI-x
when the platform provides that for other devices anyway. Only if the
platform this device is injected to does not have such support, INTx
shall be there.

- INTx is an edge interrupt
- there is no INTx status bit
- there is no pending MSI-X bitmap

Locked-down second stage page tables during runtime. We can even
check-sum their content periodically when we do not allow guest to
influence the shared memory guest location. Relevant for safety and
possibly also security scenarios.

Correct, see above. There is no point in requesting both and requiring
the hypervisor to deal with the guest switching between things during
runtime.

Of course, polling remains possible, but the guest driver should rather
obtain the interrupt-triggering state information from the much faster
shared memory. There is simply no value in also mirroring that into
interrupt registers for this particular device.

When host system provides this device, it must ensure that the MMIO
register region can be mapped by its guest as one page, without
potential overlap with other resources.

UIO. The v1 device can't be handed out to untrusted UIO applications
without intercepting the MMIO writes in the guest kernel in order to
restrict them to the valid range. This device supports that.

Yep, see above.

Likely not, didn't think about it so far. Would we gain anything by

Nope, this applies to both INTx and MSI-x. It's a building block for UIO
devices, see one-shot interrupt mode. In that mode, bit 0 will be
cleared by the device after each interrupt delivery, avoiding that the
guest UIO driver needs to do that via a vmexit.

As "set" does not mean "masked", I chose "enable" here.

Historic singular (an earlier revision only supported 2 peers). Will fix.

Right, INTx only has vector 0.

By checking those states. Both are in shared memory, thus quickly readable.

That aspect does not make things complicated with INTx, but I agree that
we should look at its "TCO" again.

Yes, except for value 0 which means "reset state". The protocols are
free to define all other values according to their needs.

Well, we are in the 0xff range. To my understanding, there are no
constraints on what you put in the other bits for that class.

Sure, can do.
