At least "objdump -d /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-vconsole-setup" does not 
contain the stfle instruction, but "ldd 
/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-vconsole-setup" is showing libz.so which could 
also contain Ilya's patches with the stfle instruction (I assume there 
is the same bug as in gzip). But I have no idea if libz is really called.

The same applies for rpmbuild.

Yes, this is a gzip bug. r0 was initialized with:
(sizeof(array-on-stack) / 8)
instead of:
(sizeof(array-on-stack) / 8) - 1

Ilya will fix it in gzip and zlib.
@Ilya: Please correct me if I'm wrong.
