Yes but that goes both ways the functionality of the region has to match
that of the device and at least in it's current state the regions functionality
matches only ISM in a way that is so specific that it is very unlikely to match anything
else. For example it can't support a PCI device that requires non-MIO but
also MSI-X. In its current form it doesn't even support PCI Store only PCI Store
Block, we had that in an earlier version and it's trivial but then we get the MSI-X
problem.

That is certainly true and I'm not strongly against matching on functionality
it just seems to me that it's too specific for that to make sense and
in that case I feel it's better to be clear about that and make it ISM
specific in name and functionality.

If we manage to find a fix for the MSI-X problem which I'd be really happy about
we can simply extend the regions functionality and reuse the same code
for a backwards compatibile ISM region and a more generic zPCI non-MIO
region that could even be used if the client (QEMU) uses non-MIO and
the device can do both as is the case for all current physical devices.
