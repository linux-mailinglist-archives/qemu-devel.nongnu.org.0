Hi Alistair,

Thanks for the heads up about the upcoming unification of RISC-V 32/64 targets.
Yet I have several concerns and would like to have some brainstorming regarding
such topics - -

That is, could you elaborate more about the "runtime check/switch" which you
mentioned in the previous e-mail :
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-08/msg02154.html
I'm not quite following the context.
If we don't have a way to toggle which (vendor) cores, which will be used,
during compile time, it means that we have to build all the vendor code and
link them all together; and we might have the chance to encounter collision on
csrno between different vendors.

Secondly, I'm not quite sure about how we're going to merge decode tree files
across RV32 and RV64. Vendor-designed custom instruction would have a different
encoding scheme on bitfields for RV32 and RV64. Currently, we (Andes) are using
different decodetree sources for gen32 and gen64 in `target/riscv/meson.build`.
I'm preparing the patch to demonstrate such hiccups.

As far as I know, there's no control flow logic for decodetree to parse
decodetree files differently. (e.g. ifdef XLEN == 32 then blah, blah).

To meet in the halfway, maybe after the grand unification on RV32/64, we can
still confine vendor custom logic (i.e. instrucions and CSRs) to be toggled by
whether a certain vendor cpu model is selected ?

By the way, I'm wondering how our friends from T-Head (Guo Ren ?) regard this
issue ? AFAIK, they forked QEMU from v3.2.0 and applied their vendor features
on top of it for quite a while.

Cordially yours,
Ruinland ChuanTzu Tsai
