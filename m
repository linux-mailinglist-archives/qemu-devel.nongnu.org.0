Yes, that would be a base consideration for any security classification. An=
d=20
it applies to 9pfs hence it would suggest 'high' for 9pfs, but ...

=2E.. this is where it already differs from reality, as 9pfs security issue=
s=20
were both handled as CVEs as well as normal reports for years, which nobody=
=20
objected.

So I wonder how helpful it would be trying to either put 9pfs into either=20
'high' or 'low', because another observed problematic with 9pfs is that the=
=20
degree of participation is so low, that if you try to impose certain formal=
=20
minimum requirements to contributors, you usually never hear from them agai=
n.

And BTW Prasad actually suggested the opposite classification:=20

Even though we discussed this issue with him in detail before, which probab=
ly=20
shows that a simple binary security classification is too coarse and too=20
ambiguous.
