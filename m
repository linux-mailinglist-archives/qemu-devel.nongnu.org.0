Nope, this is not a network card, it is a network SWITCH, used as a
regular PCI device, not network-specific. Hence the problem at hand, -
before the patch this device weren't "nic-able", so to say, because
while it is network-related PCI device, it is not a NIC.

I guess while building a list of "nic-able" cards, we should skip some
"nic-alike" devices and use some more specific criteria. Not everything
which is network-related is a regular NIC.

Maybe in time some other devices will appear in qemu with similar effect
which will require another condition.

Or adding a new field into the pci structure to indicate this device
can be a NIC will solve it once for all. Or just reverting the patch :) -
after all it isn't that bad to have a list of NIC-able devices outside
of the device definitions, - we don't have tons of devices anyway where
maintaining such a list outside of device model is a problem.

Thanks,
