The issue isn't neglecting to set a QOM parent, it's destroying a device
before its bus children get their QOM parent.

Mostly harmless: by delaying "add to bus" until right before realize, we
narrow the window where the trap is armed, and keep it completely within
qdev_init_nofail(), qdev_device_add(), and possibly code that duplicates
their work.  Ensuring qdev_init_nofail() and qdev_device_add() don't
fail in this window should be easy enough (except for writing the
comment explaining it).  The duplicates, though... I guess we need to
double-check users of qdev_set_parent_bus().

Ugly: yes, compared to the pretty invariant "bus children all have QOM
parents".

Feels feasible.


[*] We might want to look into deduplicating: the string "realized"
occurs more than 450 times, and I figure almost always as property name.
