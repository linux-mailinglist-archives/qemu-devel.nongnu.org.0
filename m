The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  /usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop should have an "Exec=3D" key.

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  According to the www.freedesktop.org .desktop-file specification, all
  "Application" desktop files should have an "Exec=3D" key. The one in
  qemu doesn't.

  This can be easily verified by running kbuildsycoca4 if KDE4 is
  present, but the issue is not DE-dependent.

  Which binary exactly should be assigned as the default one, I don't
  know.
