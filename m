I think what we're really trying to distinguish here is two
orthogonal sets of possibilities:
 * take an exception, with the PC pointing to the following insn
 * take an exception, with the PC pointing to the current insn
and also
 * take an "internal" exception
 * take a guest-visible exception

(of which we happen to only want 2 of the 4 possible flavours at
the moment). I don't particularly mind what API we use as long
as the naming/parameter setup cleanly separates out the two
orthogonal concerns such that you could have all four without
having to rename anything. Possibilities:
 * have gen_exception{_internal,}_insn and
   gen_exception{_internal,}_next_insn
 * have the functions take a bool for "exception on this insn
   or on next insn?" (not ideal because 'bool' parameters are
   a bit opaque in meaning at the callsites)
 * pass in the specific PC to use

PS: the "_insn" part of the function name isn't sacrosanct:
it sort of makes sense I think but if better names occur that
don't include it that's fine.

thanks
