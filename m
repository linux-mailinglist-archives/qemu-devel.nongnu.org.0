Don't look at the RFC spec for the RFB protocol. Instead look
at the community spec which defines all the extensions that
clients and servers have implemented. In this case, QEMU defined
an extension for scancodes:

  https://github.com/rfbproto/rfbproto/blob/master/rfbproto.rst#qemu-extended-key-event-message

this is since implemented by alot of VNC clients and severs.

The ability to send keyboard events as scancodes has already
existed since 2008 :-)

Nothing, but then this is largely a case of a user shooting themselves
in the foot, not a security issue.

You can't.

Like I said earlier in this thread, this is a big problem with
keyboard injection.

IMHO keyboard injection is only barely better than no clipboard
at all, and I don't think we should settle for that as a solution.

My preferred solution is to have QEMU leverage the existing SPICE
guest agent if at all possible, because that's already widely
available in existing guest OS.

It is better no clipboard at all.... but only just.

We should not be relying on the guest OS using VNC at all. On Windows
it is much more common to use RDP and GNOME looks to be going the same
way for Linux. We none the less want to be able to still use VNC from
the host side.

We need something to be running in the guest, and that should be
agnostic of whatever other software the guest chooses to use for
remote desktop, and should not assume the guest even has remote
desktop setup.
