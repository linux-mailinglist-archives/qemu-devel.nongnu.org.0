I don't think we need to overthink this.  Whatever objective
criteria we choose, I'm sure we'll have to adapt them later due
to real world problems.

e.g.: is 396 seconds too slow?  I don't know, it depends: does it
break Travis and other CI systems often because of timeouts?  If
yes, then we should probably tag it as slow.

If having subjective criteria is really a problem (I don't think
it is), then we can call the tag "skip_travis", and stop worrying
about defining what exactly is "slow".

I'm not sure I understand the suggestion to skip tests.  If we
skip tests after a timeout, how would we differentiate a test
being expectedly slow from a QEMU hang?
