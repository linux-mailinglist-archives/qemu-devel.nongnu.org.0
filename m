At KVM Forum 2018 I gave a presentation on security in QEMU:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DYAdRf_hwxU8 (video)
https://vmsplice.net/~stefan/stefanha-kvm-forum-2018.pdf (slides)

This patch adds a guide to secure coding practices.  This document
covers things that developers should know about security in QEMU.  It is
just a starting point that we can expand on later.  I hope it will be
useful as a resource for new contributors and will save code reviewers
from explaining the same concepts many times.

+Secure Coding Practices
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+This document covers topics that both developers and security researcher=
s must
+be aware of so that they can develop safe code and audit existing code
+properly.
+
+Reporting Security Bugs
+-----------------------
+For details on how to report security bugs or ask questions about potent=
ial
+security bugs, see the `Security Process wiki page
+<https://wiki.qemu.org/SecurityProcess>`_.
+
+General Secure C Coding Practices
+---------------------------------
+Most CVEs (security bugs) reported against QEMU are not specific to
+virtualization or emulation.  They are simply C programming bugs.  There=
fore
+it's critical to be aware of common classes of security bugs.
+
+There is a wide selection of resources available covering secure C codin=
g.  For
+example, the `CERT C Coding Standard
+<https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standar=
d>`_
+covers the most important classes of security bugs.
+
+Instead of describing them in detail here, only the names of the most im=
portant
+classes of security bugs are mentioned:
+
+* Buffer overflows
+* Use-after-free and double-free
+* Integer overflows
+* Format string vulnerabilities
+
+Some of these classes of bugs can be detected by analyzers.  Static anal=
ysis is
+performed regularly by Coverity and the most obvious of these bugs are e=
ven
+reported by compilers.  Dynamic analysis is possible with valgrind, tsan=
, and
+asan.
+
+Input Validation
+----------------
+Inputs from the guest or external sources (e.g. network, files) cannot b=
e
+trusted and may be invalid.  Inputs must be checked before using them in=
 a way
+that could crash the program, expose host memory to the guest, or otherw=
ise be
+exploitable by an attacker.
+
+The most sensitive attack surface is device emulation.  All hardware reg=
ister
+accesses and data read from guest memory must be validated.  A typical e=
xample
+is a device that contains multiple units that are selectable by the gues=
t via
+an index register::
+
+  typedef struct {
+      ProcessingUnit unit[2];
+      ...
+  } MyDeviceState;
+
+  static void mydev_writel(void *opaque, uint32_t addr, uint32_t val)
+  {
+      MyDeviceState *mydev =3D opaque;
+      ProcessingUnit *unit;
+
+      switch (addr) {
+      case MYDEV_SELECT_UNIT:
+          unit =3D &mydev->unit[val];   <-- this input wasn't validated!
+          ...
+      }
+  }
+
+If ``val`` is not in range [0, 1] then an out-of-bounds memory access wi=
ll take
+place when ``unit`` is dereferenced.  The code must check that ``val`` i=
s 0 or
+1 and handle the case where it is invalid.
+
+Unexpected Device Accesses
+--------------------------
+The guest may access device registers in unusual orders or at unexpected
+moments.  Device emulation code must not assume that the guest follows t=
he
+typical "theory of operation" presented in driver writer manuals.  The g=
uest
+may make nonsense accesses to device registers such as starting operatio=
ns
+before the device has been fully initialized.
+
+A related issue is that device emulation code must be prepared for unexp=
ected
+device register accesses while asynchronous operations are in progress. =
 A
+well-behaved guest might wait for a completion interrupt before accessin=
g
+certain device registers.  Device emulation code must handle the case wh=
ere the
+guest overwrites registers or submits further requests before an ongoing
+request completes.  Unexpected accesses must not cause memory corruption=
 or
+leaks in QEMU.
+
+Invalid device register accesses can be reported with
+``qemu_log_mask(LOG_GUEST_ERROR, ...)``.  The ``-d guest_errors`` comman=
d-line
+option enables these log messages.
+
+Live Migration
+--------------
+Device state can be saved to disk image files and shared with other user=
s.
+Live migration code must validate inputs when loading device state so an
+attacker cannot gain control by crafting invalid device states.  Device =
state
+is therefore considered untrusted even though it is typically generated =
by QEMU
+itself.
+
+Guest Memory Access Races
+-------------------------
+Guests with multiple vCPUs may modify guest RAM while device emulation c=
ode is
+running.  Device emulation code must copy in descriptors and other guest=
 RAM
+structures and only process the local copy.  This prevents
+time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions that could cause Q=
EMU to
+crash when a vCPU thread modifies guest RAM while device emulation is
+processing it.
