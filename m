It would potentially be a problem if it were called in coroutine
context. But it's a synchronous function that must be called in the main
thread (and also only used in qemu-img), so I don't see how drain could
happen while it runs.

If we did want to make it safe for use in coroutine context, it would be
by using bdrv_inc/dec_in_flight() in bdrv_make_zero().

This is bdrv_truncate(), not blk_truncate(). If you address it in
blk_truncate(), you miss the direct callers of bdrv_truncate().

But you're right that it could potentially be a problem. Not sure if it
really is, but maybe better safe than sorry, so if you want to send a
patch, go ahead.
