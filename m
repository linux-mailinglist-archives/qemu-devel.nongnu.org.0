Looks like you've compiled your binary without graphical user interface.
Either use a VNC-viewer to have a look at ":1", or try to install
gtk2-devel or sdl2-devel, and run "configure" and "make" again.

Alternatively, not sure whether it works, but maybe worth a try, you
could also try to use the BIOS from QEMU 4.1 with the pre-compiled QEMU
3.1 from your Linux distro. Use "-bios .../pc-bios/bios-256k.bin" when
you run QEMU for this.

Title:
  issue with QEMU on Raspberry Pi failing to access CDROM

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I am trying to access the CDROM (iso) from QEMU using FreeDOS and I
  get an error when doing a directory for:

  i can boot from the iso but if i exit to access the files from the
  CDROM ISO i get the attached error.

  I believe there is an issue with the QEMU for the Raspberry Pi.

  I am using a Raspberry Pi3 with the latest full Raspbian Buster load
