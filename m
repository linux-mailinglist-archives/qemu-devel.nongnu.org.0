You mean add timestamp when i calculate?
Actually, I do not want make it complicate for qemu code,
maybe it could be left for user to implement both two qmp commands
like in libvirt-api.

On the other hand, it really bother me that we need to reset calculating state
to make sure the state model could be restart in next calculation.

For now, i put it after query_dirty_rate_info is finished as you see, it should not be a good idea:(

Maybe it is better to initialize at the beginning of qmp_calc_dirty_rate().
