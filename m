Since this is virtual nvdimm(v-nvdimm) backed by a file, and the data is 
completely

in the host pagecache, and we need a way to ensure that host pagecaches

are flushed to the backend. This analogous to the WPQ flush being offloaded

to the hypervisor.

I was referrering to semantics of flushing pmem cache lines as in

oops, wrong terminologies. I was referring to guest libnvdimm and

papr_scm kernel modules.

sync-dax property translates ND_REGION_ASYNC flag being set/unset

for the pmem region also if the nvdimm_flush callback is provided in the

papr_scm or not. As everything boils down to synchronous nature

of the device, I chose sync-dax for the name.

The backend file can be dax-capable, to be hinted using "sync-dax=direct".

When the backend is not dax-capable, the "sync-dax=writeback" to used,

so that the guest makes the hcall. On all non-PPC archs, with the

"sync-dax=writeback" qemu errors out stating the lack of support.

In case the file backing the v-nvdimm is not dax-capable, we need flush

semantics on the guest to be mapped to pagecache flush on the host side.

Yes. On all platforms the "sync-dax=unsafe" meaning - with host power

failure the host pagecache is lost and subsequently data written by the

guest will also be gone. This is the default for non-PPC.


On PPC, the default is "sync-dax=writeback" - so the ND_REGION_ASYNC

is set for the region and the guest makes hcalls to issue fsync on the host.


Are you suggesting me to keep it "unsafe" as default for all architectures

including PPC and a user can set it to "writeback" if desired.
