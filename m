This is Linux.  What about other supported POSIX[*] hosts?  If any such
host has /dev/random that works here, but not /dev/urandom, we regress.

*If* there's an actual regression risk: a simple & stupid way to reduce
it risk could be falling back to /dev/random when opening /dev/urandom
fails.  Perhaps only when it fails with ENOENT.

Possible implementation: instead of setting a default filename in
rng_random_init(), change rng_random_opened() to try /dev/urandom, then
/dev/random when filename is still null.

Aside: "opened" sounds like a predicate.  Goes back to commit
a9b7b2ad7b0.

[*] POSIX because
