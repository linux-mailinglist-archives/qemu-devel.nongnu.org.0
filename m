Public bug reported:

QEMU Version: 3.1.0 as packaged in debian buster, but the code appears to d=
o the same in master.
qemu command-line: qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1G -nographic -nic "user,model=3Dv=
irtio-net-pci,tftp=3D$(pwd),net=3D10.0.2.0/24,host=3D10.0.2.2" -fsdev local=
,id=3Dfs,path=3D$thisdir/..,security_model=3Dmapped-xattr -device virtio-9p=
-pci,fsdev=3Dfs,mount_tag=3Dfs -drive "file=3D$rootdisk,if=3Dvirtio,format=
=3Draw" -kernel "$kernel" -initrd "$initrd" -append "$append"


I'm using CI that runs in a Docker container and runs a qemu VM with code a=
nd results shared via virtio 9p.
The 9p fsdev is configured with security_model=3Dmapped-xattr
When the test code attempts to create a log file in an existing directory, =
open with O_CREAT fails with -ENOENT.

The relevant strace excerpt is:

28791 openat(11, ".", O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_PATH|O_DIRECTORY) =3D 20
28791 openat(20, "src", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY=
) =3D 21
28791 fcntl(21, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) =3D 0
28791 close(20)                         =3D 0
28791 openat(21, "client.log", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOL=
LOW, 0600) =3D 20
28791 fcntl(20, F_SETFL, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW) =3D 0
28791 lsetxattr("/proc/self/fd/21/client.log", "user.virtfs.uid", "\0\0\0",=
 4, 0) =3D -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

My hypothesis for what's going wrong is since the Docker container's
overlayfs copies-up on writes, when it opens the file it's created a new
version of the `src` directory containing a `client.log`, but this new
src directory isn't accessible by file descriptor 20 and the lsetxattr
call is instead attempting to set attributes on the path in the old
`src` directory.

Looking at the code, a fix would be to change `hw/9pfs/9p-local.c` and
change `local_open2` to instead of calling `local_set_xattrat` to set
the xattrs by directory file descriptor and file name, to have a version
of local_set_xattrat` which uses `fsetxattr` to set the virtfs
attributes instead of the `fsetxattrat_nofollow` helper.

This reliably happened for me in CI, but I don't have access to the CI
host or the time to strip the test down to make a minimal test case, and
had difficulty reproducing the error on other machines.
