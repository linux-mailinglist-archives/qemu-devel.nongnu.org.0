On a successful pipeline I see

 freebsd-11  - 28 minutes
 freebsd-12  - 57 minutes
 macos       - 30 minutes

We know cirrus allows 2 concurrent jobs, so from that I infer
that the freebsd-12 job was queued for ~30 minutes waiting for
either the freebsd-11 or macos job to finish, and then it
ran in 30 minutes, giving the ~60 minute total.

That's too close to the 60 minute gitlab default job timeout
for comfort - it can easily slip over 60 minutes by just a
small amount.

80 minutes will certainly help in the case where we
randomly take a little longer than 30 minutes to build,
and have 1 of the 3 jobs queued.

When we're running jobs on both master + staging, we can
have 2 jobs running and 4 more queued - 2 of those queued
might just finish in time, but 2 will definitely fail.
My patch will cut these extra jobs on master, so in common
case we only ever get 1 queued, which should work well in
combo with your patch here. That should be good enough
for the qemu-project namespace, unless someone is triggering
pipelines for stable branch staging at the same time as
the master branch staging.

If we do want to worry about more than 2 queued jobs
again for that reason, we might consider putting
it upto 100 minutes. That would give us enough slack to
have 4 queued jobs behind two running jobs and have
them all succeed

Whether 80 or 100 minute, consider it
