Then why do you make me track your series and asking me to check if you 
broke anything in my patches during your rebase that I've asked you not 
to do? The series I've submitted (both my original and the one with your 
changes) were tested and made sure it worked with AmigaOS that you say you 
can't test.

You don't seem to leave your hands off and got involved voluntarily so now 
don't run away :-)

I'm no hardware engineer either but in any case pci_set_irq cannot be used 
from a PCIDevice as I explained in the other message so your approach with 
that is clearly wrong and we need gpios that something else connects to 
the PCI bus. You could only do that if the VIA chip was a north bridge 
that had a PCI bus but it doesn't. In pegasos2 the north bridge is the 
MV64361 but the PCI interrupt lines are connected to its GPP (General 
purpose or multi purpose pins in docs that are just gpio lines, which are 
programmable inputs or outputs). These can generate an interrupt in the 
MV64361 but the VT8231 also has an ability to route PCI IRQs to ISA 
interrupts which some guests use. So I think the way I've modeled it is 
correct by connecting the PCI bus interrupt pins to both of these chips 
and since they are independent models the only place you can do it cleanly 
is the board code. Other boards may connect the VIA PIRQ pins differently 
but this model allows for that now. What is that you still don't like 
about it?
