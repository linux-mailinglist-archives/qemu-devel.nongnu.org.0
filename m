Definitely not.

Yes, that would be better, because those are the exact semantics that we want.
 Though it would be Really Nice to know what's up with gitlab...

Yes, that could benefit from MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE.

I do think there's a way we could streamline the 32-on-64 case.  At present we
are groveling through /proc/self/maps, or mmaping+unmaping, and then mmaping.
Whereas we could just mmap once and be done -- it's the 32-on-32 case that
requires the song and dance.
