Not exactly.

Partly that's just old bad naming. Ideally, driver handlers should be refactored to have one
.bdrv_set_perm(, ... tran, errp) handler. Or at least renamed to .prepare and .commit instead of misleading .check and .set.

Secondly what is important, is that corresponding .set actions are not visible to other block-graph modifying actions (like taking locks on fd. other actions, like attach/detach children don't care of it)/ (Or, at least, they _shoud not be_ visible :) To be honest, I don't have real expertise, of how much these .set actions are visible or not by other block-graph modifying actions, but I believe that we are OK in common scenarios).

What is really visible at generic block layer? Visible is change of .perm / .shared_perm fields of BdrvChild. And they are set in .prepare, look at bdrv_child_set_perm().

So, after calling bdrv_child_set_perm() other actions of .prepare stage will see _updated_ permissions. And if transaction fails, we rollback .perm and .shared_perm fields in bdrv_child_set_perm_abort()

Yes, untie the knot of drained sections during aio context change is a challenge.. And that's (at least on of) the reason why aio-context change is still not a native part of block graph modifying transactions.

Could there be some simple solution?

Like

1. drain the whole subgraph of all nodes connected with nodes that we are going to touch

2. do block graph modifying transaction (including aio context change) knowing that everything we need is drained. (so we don't have to care about drain during aio context change)

3. undrain the subgraph

In other words, is that really necessary to lock/unlock different contexts during the aio-context-change procedure? Or we can move to a lot larger and simpler drained section?
