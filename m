Is the device only adding a calendar entry and not doing any actual
device emulation at this stage?

If yes, then this suggests the system could be structured more cleanly.
The vhost-user device process should focus on device emulation.  It
should not be aware of the calendar.  The vhost-user protocol also
shouldn't require modifications.

Instead, Linux arch/um code would add the entry to the calendar when the
CPU wants to kick a vhost-user device.  I assume the CPU is suspended
until arch/um code completes adding the entry to the calendar.

When the calendar decides to run the device entry it signals the
vhost-user kick eventfd.  The vhost-user device processes the virtqueue
as if it had been directly signalled by the CPU, totally unaware that
it's running within a simulation system.

The irq path is similar: the device signals the callfd and the calendar
adds an entry to notify UML that the request has completed.

Some pseudo-code:

arch/um/drivers/.../vhost-user.c:

  void um_vu_kick(struct um_vu_vq *vq)
  {
      if (simulation_mode) {
          calendar_add_entry({
              .type =3D CAL_ENTRY_TYPE_VHOST_USER_KICK,
              .device =3D vq->dev,
              .vq_idx =3D vq->idx,
          });
          return;
      }

      /* The normal code path: signal the kickfd */
      uint64_t val =3D 1;
      write(vq->kickfd, &val, sizeof(val));
  }

I'm suggesting this because it seems like a cleaner approach than
exposing the calendar concept to the vhost-user devices.  I'm not 100%
sure it offers the semantics you need to make everything deterministic
though.

A different topic: vhost-user does not have a 1:1 vq buffer:kick
relationship.  It's possible to add multiple buffers and kick only once.
It is also possible for the device to complete multiple buffers and only
call once.

This could pose a problem for simulation because it allows a degree of
non-determinism.  But as long as the both the CPU and the I/O completion
of the device happen on a strict schedule this isn't a problem.
