I don't follow what you're saying.  You read both the eyecatcher and
version from the structure before you ever set expected_buffsize.

So, that's one possibility.  But, although it's technically permitted
for a guest to provide a big buffer asking for the same stat over and
over, is there actually any reason to support such a pointless way of
using the interface?  If not, could we just set the hard cap to the
number of different stats we support.

So, yes, you'd probably get away with it.  I really dislike relying on
"wrong but we'll catch it later" logic.  I really prefer to perform
the bounds check *before* performing the guest memory access.

Ah.. yes, I forgot about that option.  Mind you if you set the max
number of requests to the max number of stats as suggested above, you
could simplify this path as well.

You don't need that; g_malloc() will abort() on allocation failure.
