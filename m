I'm not sure if we actually need the full driver or not for testing
purposes. The the GenID is just in memory somewhere, and the somewhere
is reported via ACPI table entry. For QEMU its easy as the data is
exposed via fw_cfg which can be read from sysfs directly without
even needing to look at ACPI entries to find it. Not sure how we
find it with VMWare/HyperV though.

Daniel
