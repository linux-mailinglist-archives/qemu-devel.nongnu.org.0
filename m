As all conditions are in the form of "if (s->version > X)" then 
incrementing version from 1 to 2 doesn't break any condition of "if 
(s->version > 1)".
What is the challenge of backporting I'm missing?

I agree. That's the PVSCSI approach of compat_flags. Have many 
properties but each define bit in a compat_flags that specifies behavior.
The disadvantage it have is that it over-complicates code and introduce 
many properties that will never be used as it's just for internal 
binding to machine-type.

Hmm this could a nice and simple approach.
Will it be OK then in this case to define "x-vmport-fixes" value in 
hw_compat_4_2[] to a hard-coded value (e.g. "20") without directly 
encoding each individual bit via vmport.h constants?
I will note though that it seems this "x-vmport-fixes" bitmap seems to 
be the first of it's kind. But I'm OK with this approach.

Well, the ".vmx" file is the configuration file for the VM given to VMX. 
But I agree VMware terminology is weird. :)

No. It's just use to specify things related to VMX. i.e. The host VMM.

vmware-version is also confusing. As one could confuse it with the 
product version number.
VMware called this field "vmx-version" and "vmx-type". I don't know if 
they have another field that maybe is called "vmware-version"...

We are giving it here the same meaning VMware gave it. In the context of 
VMware VMPort.

VMX stands for the host VMM. But I don't see why I need to be in the 
position explaining the reason behind VMware terminology.
I'm just suggesting to use it as-is to avoid confusion.

It seems you are still not convinced by above arguments, so I will 
change this in v3 to what you preferred "vm-exec-version" & "vm-exec-type".
I think this is a mistake but you have the final call as the maintainer 
and I accept that.
