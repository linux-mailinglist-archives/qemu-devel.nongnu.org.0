My configure command line used to work and now it doesn't.
There is no workaround that I'm aware of that I can use
by tweaking the configure options. That's a clear regression.

There is no --disable-udev ! If there was I'd just have
used it.

The last time this came up it was in an all-in-configure
test, so I took the approach of making the test a bit smarter
to sanity check that what it was getting from pkg-config
really worked:
https://patchew.org/QEMU/20200928160402.7961-1-peter.maydell@linaro.org/
I don't know enough meson to do that in meson, so this patch is
the simple change that fixes the regression by reinstating the
logic configure had.

I don't think we want to try to say "look at what statically
linked libraries are in Debian". The point of configure
style logic is to look at what is present when we try to compile
and, when something is an optional feature, only compile it
in if it's going to work.

It would be better to do the "see if a static library is present"
test. This isn't too hard to do in configure (compare that
six line fix to the detection of libgio). Hopefully it is
not too hard to do in meson ?

I agree that we don't really very solidly support this use case,
and it's pretty much "if it doesn't work we accept point-fixes
to the build machinery and/or recommend more use of --disable-foo".
But it is still useful sometimes to have.
