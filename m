Could a new Linux personality flag be useful in combination with a
new flag in binfmt_misc.

eg a flag "E" for binfmt_misc which indicates the rule must only be
applied if the process is execve()d with PER_USE_BINFMT personality
set.

That would let you add a native match rule to binfmt_misc without
it affecting your system initially. To then run native binaries via
qemu-user you just need to set the personality() flag and the only
that  sub-process tree gets redirected.

Daniel
