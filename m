Looks good.

OK, this includes the last step of that procedure too, i.e.:

      11. Otherwise store 0x0 to the 'CPU selector' register, to put it
          into a valid state and exit.

This looks good as well.

I'm happy to R-b this patch, with one caveat: in edk2, I might not want
to -- or have to -- fetch the full array of arch-specific CPU IDs in
advance. That's one possibility, yes -- but it's also possible that I'll
only fetch the arch CPU ID for the freshly hotplugged CPU in the SMI
handler. I don't know yet.

So, as long as OVMF is not expected to *only* implement the typical use
case here, I'm OK with this algorithm, because it looks valid to me.

I'd just like to keep the option open to use the CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD
command for such a CPU as well that has been selected with -- say --
CPHP_GET_NEXT_CPU_WITH_EVENT_CMD.

With that:

(If you like, you could also split this patch in two -- repost the first
half (with the register documentation update) with my R-b at once, and
delay the second half (the typical use case for CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD)
until I "get there" in edk2. Up to you.)

Thanks!
Laszlo
