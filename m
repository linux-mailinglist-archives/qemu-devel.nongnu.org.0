Honestly, I have a different use case than Denis. But I think his assessm=
ent
of this improvement is reasonable.

My use case (sorry I didn't mention it before):
I need this improvement to make sure that a single iteration of the main =
loop
will be enough to handle at least a single QMP command.

It's helpful for my another patch:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-11/msg04100.html

If incoming migration yields for just a single byte of QMP stream so it n=
eeds
about 30 such yields to handle something like query-status to check wheth=
er
incoming-QEMU is still alive or not.

Yury
