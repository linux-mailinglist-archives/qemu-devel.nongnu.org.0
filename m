Yes, it's a shame for the mistake.

I checked the linux kernel commit history and found that F_OFD_SETLK was
introduced at v3.15 as below:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0d3f7a2dd2f5cf9642982515e020c1ae=
e2cf7af6

So maybe I need update my kernel to fit this new macro, and as you said,
most users will compile virtiofsd based on new kernel, that seems not a
big deal. At last, thanks for your detailed explanation.

Thanks,
Jun
