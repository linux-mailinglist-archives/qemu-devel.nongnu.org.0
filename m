Page alignment is a bit odd with vhost-user - it ends up having to mmap
each of the sections itself; and still has to map them as hugepages
to be able to mmap - in the old world you could sometimes have
the daemon mmaping the same chunk of memory twice into the vhost-user
process; without the aggregation  you'd get a hugepage mapping for the
0-2MB chunk for the 0-512K mapping, and then maybe another 0-2MB chunk
for some of the other parts over 512K.
With postcopy we can't have the multiple mappings of the same part of
guest memory; we need to have one mapping for userfault.

Also, given the 16 separate synic regions, you'd probably end up having
a lot of wasted vhost-sections.
