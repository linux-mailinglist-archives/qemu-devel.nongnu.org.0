I guess an unwired NIC behaves as if no cable was plugged into the
external connector ("no carrier").

We can model that.

We use -nic to configure onboard NICs.

The configuration gets deposited in nd_table[] for board code to pick
up.

Boards use nd_table[0] for their first NIC, nd_table[1] for the second,
and so forth.  How they order their NICs is part of their stable user
interface.

To leave a NIC unplugged, use -nice none.  Example: -nic none -nic user
leaves the first NIC unplugged, and plugs the second one using a user
network backend.

Say the board contains a SoC that provides four NICs, but the board
wires up only the last one.  Then board code should use nd_table[0] for
that last one.

I don't remember whether network device frontends can work without a
backend, or need a null backend.  If the latter, then board code needs
to supply such null backends.

>> How should we proceed in such cases ?

Model the physical hardware as faithfully as we can.

Follow-up patches welcome!
