I saw this discussion from the side and I just wanted to point out that =
as far
as I understand this interface is needed to sync *wallclock time* =
between the
guest and the host, mostly for user experience. There is no guarantee =
that it's
monotonic. Unlike TSC, we don't need to take special care with regard to =
live
migration or drift.

Just as NTP may report inconsistent time, it's OK if this interface is =
somewhat
inconsistent.

I think that the reason that open-vm-tools doesn't move time backwards =
is to
help applications that treat wallclock time as if it's monotonic time =
and break
if the date is moved backwards (which may happen more frequently in =
virtual
environment so it's handled specifically). But this doesn't change the =
fact that
this PV interface is for reporting wall time. So I couldn't understand =
what
source other than gettimeofday() you were suggesting for Liran to use to =
report
wallclock time.
