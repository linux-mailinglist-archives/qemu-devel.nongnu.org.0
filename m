The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  qemu-user: $0 incorrectly always reports absolute path

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  We just ran into an issue with the Perl package on Debian/m68k when
  being built with qemu-user [1].

  The problem can be boiled down to qemu-user always reporting absolute
  paths for the shell variable $0 no matter on how the command was
  invoked.

  A simple reproducer is this:

  On normal system (no emulation):

  root@nofan:~> sh -c 'echo $0'
  sh
  root@nofan:~>

  On qemu-user:

  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/# sh -c 'echo $0'
  /bin/sh
  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/#

  > [1] https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2019/07/msg00007.html
