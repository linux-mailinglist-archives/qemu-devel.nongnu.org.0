Hi,

While reviewing the =E2=80=9Cfix two small memleaks=E2=80=9D series
(<20200227012950.12256-1-pannengyuan@huawei.com>) I noticed that we save
ImageCheck.(leaks|corruptions)_fixed from the first run and overwrite
the values obtained in the second run (where they must be zero because
we do not request any fixes in that second run), but we do not overwrite
ImageCheck.has_(leaks|corruptions)_fixed after the second run.  That
smells fishy.

Furthermore, ImageCheck.has_(leaks|corruptions)_fixed are not set based
on whether (leaks|corruptions)_fixed is non-zero, but actually based on
whether the leaks and corruptions fields (respectively) are non-zero.
qcow2=E2=80=99s check implementation reduces the leaks and corruptions valu=
es
when it fixes them, because then there are no leaks and corruptions
after the check anymore.

All in all, after a successful run, you will not see
=E2=80=9Cqemu-img check --output=3Djson=E2=80=9D report corruptions-fixed o=
r leaks-fixed.
Which is a shame.  So this series fixes that and adds a test to ensure
those fields are indeed reported.


v2:
- Patch 2:
  - Rewrote the new functions as per Eric=E2=80=99s suggestions (thanks a l=
ot!)
  - Changed the functions=E2=80=99 =E2=80=9Cdoc strings=E2=80=9D to not jus=
t show an example,
    but perhaps more importantly what each parameter means
- Patch 3:
  - Eric said the pre-existing comment explaining why 138 doesn=E2=80=99t
    supported data_file made it sound like qemu-img check had a bug.
    I=E2=80=99m sure it does have bugs, but this isn=E2=80=99t one, so I tr=
ied to
    explain it a bit differently.
  - Use poke_file_be in another place
  - Convert sed | grep | sed to a single sed, as per Eric=E2=80=99s suggest=
ion,
    and avoid \< and \>
