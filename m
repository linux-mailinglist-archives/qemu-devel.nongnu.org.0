Markus,

Thank you for your comments! Based on your questions and suggestions of
writing a more complete explanation in my commits, I decided to start to
describe our whole work on the wiki:
https://wiki.qemu.org/Internships/ProjectIdeas/TCGCodeQuality
I will update and expand it weekly, so I can link and cite it in future
patches to give a better whole vision for anyone interested.

Btw, thank you for your QMP tips, I will discuss with Alex how to address
it in our approach.

[]'s
Vanderson M. Rosario
