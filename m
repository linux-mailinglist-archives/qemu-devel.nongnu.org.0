Testing on current master shows the behavior is correct. I guess rth's
patch fixed this case.

Title:
  ppc: softfloat float implementation issues

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  Per bug #1841491, Richard Henderson (rth) said:
  > The float test failure is part of a larger problem for target/powerpc
  > in which all float routines are implemented incorrectly. They are all
  > implemented as double operations with rounding to float as a second
  > step. Which not only produces incorrect exceptions, as in this case,
  > but incorrect numerical results from the double rounding.
  >
  > This should probably be split to a separate bug...
