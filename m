The discussion noted in comment#4 petered out in March 2017. Closing
this ticket as "Invalid" (only because LP does not let me use the "Won't
Fix" resolution -- the report / feature request may very well have had
merit, but apparently a good enough design could not be found).

Title:
  SIGQUIT to send ACPI-shutdown to Guest

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  When qemu receives SIGQUIT, it should first try to run
  system_powerdown (giving the guest an ACPI signal to begin the
  shutdown process), before ending the whole qemu process.

  At this point there is no way to do a graceful shutdown if you do not
  have access to the monitor and you do not use any wrapper like
  libvirt.

  If, for some reason SIGQUIT would not be accepted as the signal, take
  any free to use signal, like SIGUSR1. There should be a way to get
  ACPI shutdown sent to the guest.
