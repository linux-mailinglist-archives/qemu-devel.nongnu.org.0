Fair enough. As I said in the cover, all this patches makes no functional
changes, just a clean up aiming for less LoC (and more clarity, at least
in my opinion).

I am aware all the good sides of keeping the code as is, such as being
easier to debug (although I would argue that an explicit trace_event
call is better than keeping verbose code 'just in case'), or goto usage
to keep just one return statement per function.

I am also aware that the existing QEMU code base has a mesh of styles.
What I'm proposing here isn't a 'my way is better' case by any means,
but it's not something unprecedented in the existing code base either.
Since there's no QEMU code guideline imposing that a function should
have only one 'return' statement regardless of how many 'goto' calls
are needed, or a guideline that discourages 'goto' calls regardless of
how many 'return' calls are needed, in the end it's a matter of seeing
what fits the function/code better. In the maintainers opinion, of
course.


Thanks,


DHB
