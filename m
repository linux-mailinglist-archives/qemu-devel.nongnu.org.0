..apparently v7 ended up in a weird base64 that would not easily git-am.
Resending.

hi,

yet another take for this patch series; please kindly consider these for 4.1

Just a few cosmetic comments were received for v6 so this is mostly
a rebase+ping.

new in v7:
    - general rebase
    - since clauses -> 4.1
    - patch 8: not completely trivial rebase: raw_account_discard moved to
      common raw_do_pdiscard()
    - patch 9: comment wording fixed

v6: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-11/msg06633.html
v5: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-10/msg06828.html
v4: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-08/msg04308.html
v3: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-06/msg03688.html

----

qmp query-blockstats provides stats info for write/read/flush ops.

Patches 1-7 implement the similar for discard (unmap) command for scsi
and ide disks.
Discard stat "unmap_ops / unmap_bytes" is supposed to account the ops that
have completed without an error.

However, discard operation is advisory. Specifically,
 - common block layer ignores ENOTSUP error code.
   That might be returned if the block driver does not support discard,
   or discard has been configured to be ignored.
 - format drivers such as qcow2 may ignore discard if they were configured
   to ignore that, or if the corresponding area is already marked unused
   (unallocated / zero clusters).

And what is actually useful is the number of bytes actually discarded
down on the host filesystem.
To achieve that, driver-specific statistics has been added to blockstats
(patch 9).
With patch 8, file-posix driver accounts discard operations on its level too.

query-blockstat result:

(note the difference between blockdevice unmap and file discard stats. qcow2
sends fewer ops down to the file as the clusters are actually unallocated
on qcow2 level)
