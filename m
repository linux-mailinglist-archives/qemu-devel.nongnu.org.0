So if I understand correctly, the problem is that without a filter, in
some setups we get a usable BlockBackend name like "drive1", but when a
filter is added, we return the node-name instead which is
auto-generated and will be different on the destination.

Looking at the ChildRole documentation:

    /* Returns a name that is supposedly more useful for human users than the
     * node name for identifying the node in question (in particular, a BB
     * name), or NULL if the parent can't provide a better name. */
    const char *(*get_name)(BdrvChild *child);

I'd argue that a BlockBackend name is more useful for a human user even
across filter, so I'd support a .get_name implementation for a filter
child role (which Max wanted to introduce anyway for his filter series).

Of course, if you have a function that is made to return a convenient
text for human users, and you use it for a stable ABI like the migration
stream, this is an idea that would certainly have caused an entertaining
Linus rant in the good old kernel times.

I meant this more as the preferred way for the future rather than the
only thing supported.

But Peter has actually mentioned that for libvirt it will be
blockdev-only anyway. So do we even have a good reason to invest much
for the non-blockdev case?

Maybe making it blockdev-only is actually pretty reasonable.

It's high on my wishlist, though we can't before libvirt uses blockdev.

Maybe something to talk about at KVM Forum?

More like we can't rely on BlockBackend names in a blockdev setup.
BlockBackend names can work in a purely traditional setup if we make
some effort to find the block backend even with filters in bettwen, but
they aren't universal even then. And node-names work in the blockdev
case, but they aren't universal either.

But as I said above, you made me wonder whether making it a
blockdev-only feature wouldn't actually be a good idea.

-hda and -cdrom currently have hard-coded BlockBackend names. I don't
see what would stop us from changing this to hard-coded node names.

-drive is something that we probably need to remove in its current form
and introduce something new that is both user-friendly and powerful.
Actually, we should probably add the replacement first. :-)
