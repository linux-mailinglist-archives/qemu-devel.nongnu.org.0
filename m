the main difference between EPYC and all other CPUs is that
it requires numa configuration (it's not optional)
so we need an extra patch on top of this series to enfoce that, i.e:

 if (epyc && !numa) 
    error("EPYC cpu requires numa to be configured")

I think there was a patch in previous revisions that aimed for this.
Simplest form would be above snippet.

More complex one, would be moving auto_enable_numa from MachineClass to
MachineState so we can change it at runtime if EPYC is used. That should
take care of use case where user hasn't provided -numa.


Eduardo,
 is there any way to tell managment that particular CPU type requires
 -numa ?
