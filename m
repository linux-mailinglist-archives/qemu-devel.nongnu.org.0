Several overall queries about this:

1) Since it's explicitly handling PASIDs, this seems a lot more
   specific to SVM than the name suggests.  I'd suggest a rename.

2) Why are you hand rolling structures of pointers, rather than making
   this a QOM class or interface and putting those things into methods?

3) It's not really clear to me if this is for the case where both
   stages of translation are visible to the guest, or only one of
   them.
