I was just trying to suggest using make variables as input to
check-acceptance, instead of creating separate makefile rules for
each set of test cases.  But you are right:

Yes, if we use tags to exclude tests, the command line would look
different.  Maybe something like:

  make check-acceptance EXCLUDE_TAGS=3Dskip-travis

The exact format of the arguments don't matter to me, as long as
we don't require people to write new makefile rules just because
they want to run a different set of test cases.
