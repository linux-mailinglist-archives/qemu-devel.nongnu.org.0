I don't think it does - the check is just moved to nvme_addr_is_cmb:

    static inline bool nvme_addr_is_cmb(NvmeCtrl *n, hwaddr addr)
    {
        hwaddr low = n->ctrl_mem.addr;
        hwaddr hi  = n->ctrl_mem.addr + int128_get64(n->ctrl_mem.size);

        return addr >= low && addr < hi;
    }

We check that `addr` is less than `hi`. Maybe the name is unfortunate...
