Yes, I made a copy and compared the files with binwalk.

I added the following to the qemu_preadv:

     // do it again
     unsigned char *buf =3D g_malloc(cnt);
     struct iovec v =3D {buf, cnt};
     res =3D preadv(fd, &v, 1, offset);
     assert(cnt =3D=3D res);
     uint32_t sum2 =3D 0;
     for (i =3D 0 ; i < cnt ; ++i)
         sum2 +=3D buf[i];
     g_free(buf);
     qemu_log("--- sum2 =3D %x\n", sum2);
     assert(sum2 =3D=3D sum);

These two reads give different results.
But who can modify the buffer while qcow2 workers filling it with data=20
from the disk?
