Hi Peter, Thanks for the nice details. I just posted v3 to address
(1) and (2).

For (3), I'm not sure. It seems we need some registers to record the
details on why the SError is raised. For ARMv8 with RAS extension is
supported, VSESR_EL2 can be used. Otherwise, we probably need some
space in ESR_EL1. For aarch32, DFSR might be the alternative. With
more details about the cause, the "NMI" and other errors can be
classified.

May I ask if the SError is going to be triggered by simulated device
or real one, or both in future? If it's corresponding to host memory
error, it seems it should be triggered by a real hardware. In this case,
the error should be intercepted and then delivered to guest. I need
more details how the SError will be used for RAS.

Thanks,
Gavin
