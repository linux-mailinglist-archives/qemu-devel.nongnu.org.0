I tried to get rid of the extra state location (kvm_vtime), but we still
need it because kvm_arch_get_registers() doesn't take 'level', like
kvm_arch_put_registers() does. Maybe it should? Without being able to
filter out TIMER_CNT at get time too, then if we migrate a paused guest
we'll resume with vtime including the ticks between the pause and the
start of the migration. Adding the additional state (kvm_vtime) and a
cpu_pre_save() hook to fixup the cpreg value is a possible way to resolve
that. That's what I've done for v3, which I'll post shortly.

It wasn't overwriting because we weren't detecting a runstate
transition from paused to running. However, for v3, I've dropped
the explicit running/pause transition checking and now ensured
we get the right value with a cpu_post_load() hook.

I think I've mimicked this logic now for arm in v3.
