Yes, I'm aware.

Yeah.. I'm concerned about this, but I'm not sure what to do about it.

Yeah.. x86 also has the advantage of enough visibility that it can
reasonbly easily get mgmt layers to do stuff about it.  This is much
harder for POWER :/.

It doesn't really make sense to do so.  For x86 - or more strictly for
pc - the change from PCI to PCIe is a pretty fundamental system change
with affects in lots of places, which makes a whole new versioned
series of machine types a reasonable option.

For pseries - that's not really the case.  PCI under PAPR is
paravirtualized, and it always has been.  The interface we're matching
is not real hardware, but the PAPR spec and to a lesser extent the
existing PowerVM implementation of it.

[Aside: you've made a subtle but common x86-centric assumption above
 that there's only one important platform design per ISA.  There
 is a real PCIe based PPC  machine type in "pnv" (and maybe some of
 the embedded ones as well), but that's not the environment we care
 about for guests in production, since we can't use KVM with it]

What PAPR has is an odd hybrid - individual devices can be PCIe (we
have calls to access extended config space) - but the overall bus
structure is more-or-less like vanilla PCI.

I think it would be possible to kind of expose a more PCIe like
structure, but a) it would be weirdly artificial, b) it doesn't match
the PAPR interfaces very well, c) it would make our behaviour
different from PowerVM.

It would certainly be possible to better handle PCIe devices on a root
bus.  That's been on my todo someday list for ages, but I've kept
putting it off because the tangible benefits are pretty minimal.

Note that several things that I believe are now in the PCIe spec, but
really derive more from PC legacy considerations, don't apply at all
for PAPR.  e.g. there's no meaningful distinction between integrated
and slotted devices, multiple independent host bridges is routine and
doesn't require any (virtual) hardware visible domain numbers.
