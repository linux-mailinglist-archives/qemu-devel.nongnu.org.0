I do agree for the error, but right now if you give a wrong base 
address, it does not fail (see below).

I can give a look to see if such check would be possible.

Nothing if you pass the ram_size check. You can even try to load 
something to an unmapped area, it doesn't report an error.

But it does not do anything visible to the guest I suppose (in the 
monitor, x/'xp' commands still tell you it cannot access the memory if 
you tried to load it somewhere that does not exist).

If you try to load something bigger than the target region, the region 
seems to be initialized.

Thanks,
Damien
