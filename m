Since the introduction of a backup filter node, the backup block job
crashes when the target image is smaller than the source image because
it will try to write after the end of the target node without having
BLK_PERM_RESIZE. (Previously, the BlockBackend layer would have caught
this and errored out gracefully.)

We can fix this and even do better than the old behaviour: Check that
source and target have the same image size at the start of the block job
and unshare BLK_PERM_RESIZE. This will immediately error out when
starting the job instead of only when writing to a block that doesn't
exist in the target.

Longer target than source would technically work because we would never
write to blocks that don't exist, but semantically these are invalid,
too, because a backup is supposed to create a copy, not just an image
that starts with a copy.

The bugs were introduced in commits 2c8074c45 (BLK_PERM_RESIZE is shared
since this commit) and 00e30f05d (BdrvChild instead of BlockBackend
turns I/O errors into assertion failures).
