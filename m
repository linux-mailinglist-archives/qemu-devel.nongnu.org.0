Two pieces to this, the first is that the string is opaque exactly so
that the vendor driver can express whatever they need in it.  The user
should never infer that two devices are compatible.  The second is that
this is not a resource availability or reservation interface.  The fact
that a target device would be compatible for migration should not take
into account whether the target has the resources to actually create
such a device.  Doing so would imply some sort of resource reservation
support that does not exist.  Matrix devices are clearly a bit
complicated here since maybe the source is expressing a component of
the device that doesn't exist on the target.  In such a "resource not
available at all" case, it might be fair to nak the compatibility test,
but a "ok, but resource not currently available" case should pass,
imo.  Thanks,

Alex
