In addition to reviews you already have,

I definitely like the idea of only blowing away what we created - but if 
we created build, then recreating it for each new configure run is nice.

Using -maxdepth gets rid of the need to pre-create empty directories for 
nested binaries, but also loses out on binaries such as 
x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64.  Oh, it looks like meson creates 
qemu-system-x86_64 as a binary in the top level, then a symlink in its 
old location.  Populating symlinks to ALL old locations is thus trickier 
than what you are proposing here, so it is fine to save that for a 
followup patch (let's get the bare minimum in first, so that at least 
./configure && make works, before we worry about back-compat symlinks).

Nice comment for reviewers, but doesn't quite need to be preserved in git.

This behaves wrong if CDPATH is set in the environment.  We should 
really include CDPATH in our environment sanitization at the top of the 
file.

bashism; s/==/=/ or you will break configure on dash systems

Do we want a way for a user to type './configure builddir=build/' and 
'make builddir=build/' so they can specify different builddir overrides 
per invocation (of course, where builddir defaults to 'build/' if not 
specified)?  But hardcoding to _just_ ./build/ for getting this patch in 
quickly is fine.

If you use 'EOF' or \EOF here, then...

you wouldn't have to escape all these $.  Looking through the file...

...I didn't see any use of $ that was not supposed to be literally in 
the generated GNUmakefile.

Now that we are guaranteeing configure is run in a build directory, this 
part of configure might have some cleanups possible.  But that can be a 
separate patch.

Looking forward to v2.
