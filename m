Patches that arrive and are only ready Tuesday afternoon are
naturally at risk of slipping into the next RC. That's OK.
Though when we get to rc2/rc3 you should warn me when you
expect that so I can make a decision about whether it's better
to slip the rc by a day to wait for them.

Mostly what I mean is "don't assume that because RC day is Tuesday
that you can send a pullreq on Tuesday and have it get into the RC".
If it turns out that you have to do that, that's not a big problem.
What is a problem is if half a dozen submaintainers all send a
pullreq at once on the Tuesday afternoon. So in the situation where
you don't anticipate anything much late arriving then send it earlier.

I could in theory I guess, but my scripting assumes one at once.
