Then I think it would be best to make (or propose at least) that change
early in the release cycle. In other words, now. :-)

Okay, if you as the Python maintainer say so, I'll gladly follow your
advice.

Maybe we can modify iotests so that it just skips Python tests if the
minimum version isn't available to keep the impact of deviating from the
global minimum version as small as possible. Of course, this will only
be necessary if your proposal to make 3.5 the minimum for all of QEMU is
rejected.
