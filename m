Based on "docs/specs/acpi_cpu_hotplug.txt", this seems to boil down to a
bunch of IO port accesses at base 0x0cd8.

Is that correct?

> [Jiewen] The PI specification Volume 4 - SMM defines EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate() - It can be used to communicate between OS and SMM handler. But it requires the runtime protocol call. I am not sure how OS loader passes this information to OS kernel.

I'm confused about the details. In two categories:
(1) what values to use,
(2) how those values are passed.

Assume a CPU is hotpluged, QEMU injects an SCI, and the ACPI GPE handler
in the OS -- which also originates from QEMU -- writes a particular byte
to the Data port (0xB3), and then to the Control port (0xB2),
broadcasting an SMI.

(1) What values to use.

Note that values ICH9_APM_ACPI_ENABLE (2) and ICH9_APM_ACPI_DISABLE (3)
are already reserved in QEMU for IO port 0xB2, for different purposes.
So we can't use those in the GPE handler.

Furthermote, OVMF's EFI_SMM_CONTROL2_PROTOCOL.Trigger() implementation
(in "OvmfPkg/SmmControl2Dxe/SmmControl2Dxe.c") writes 0 to both ports,
as long as the caller does not specify them.

  IoWrite8 (ICH9_APM_STS, DataPort    == NULL ? 0 : *DataPort);
  IoWrite8 (ICH9_APM_CNT, CommandPort == NULL ? 0 : *CommandPort);

And, there is only one Trigger() call site in edk2: namely in
"MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmIpl.c", in the
SmmCommunicationCommunicate() function.

(That function implements EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate().)
This call site passes NULL for both DataPort and CommandPort.

Yet further, EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate() is used for
example by the UEFI variable driver, for talking between the
unprivileged (runtime DXE) and privileged (SMM) half.

As a result, all of the software SMIs currently in use in OVMF, related
to actual firmware services, write 0 to both ports.

I guess we can choose new values, as long as we avoid 2 and 3 for the
control port (0xB2), because those are reserved in QEMU -- see
ich9_apm_ctrl_changed() in "hw/isa/lpc_ich9.c".


(2) How the parameters are passed.


(2a) For the new CPU, the SMI remains pending, until it gets an
INIT-SIPI-SIPI from one of the previously plugged CPUs (most likely, the
BSP). At that point, the new CPU will execute the "initial SMI handler
for hotplugged CPUs", at the default SMBASE.

That's a routine we'll have to write in assembly, from zero. In this
routine, we can read back IO ports 0xB2 and 0xB3. And QEMU will be happy
to provide the values last written (see apm_ioport_readb() in
"hw/isa/apm.c"). So we can receive the values in this routine. Alright.


(2b) On all other CPUs, the SMM foundation already accepts the SMI.

There point where it makes sense to start looking is SmmEntryPoint()
[MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmCore.c].

(2b1) This function first checks whether the SMI is synchronous. The
logic for determining that is based on
"gSmmCorePrivate->CommunicationBuffer" being non-NULL. This field is set
to non-NULL in SmmCommunicationCommunicate() -- see above, in (1).

In other words, the SMI is deemed synchronous if it was initiated with
EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate(). In that case, the
HandlerType GUID is extracted from the communication buffer, and passed
to SmiManage(). In turn, SmiManage() locates the SMI handler registered
with the same handler GUID, and delegates the SMI handling to that
specific handler.

This is how the UEFI variable driver is split in two halves:

- in "MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/RuntimeDxe/VariableSmm.c", we have
a call to gMmst->MmiHandlerRegister(), with HandlerType =
"gEfiSmmVariableProtocolGuid"

- in
"MdeModulePkg/Universal/Variable/RuntimeDxe/VariableSmmRuntimeDxe.c", we
format communication buffers with the header GUID set to the same
"gEfiSmmVariableProtocolGuid".

Of course, this is what does *not* apply to our use case, as the SMI is
raised by the OS (via an ACPI method), and *not* by a firmware agent
that calls EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate().

Therefore, we need to look further in SmmEntryPoint()
[MdeModulePkg/Core/PiSmmCore/PiSmmCore.c].

(2b2) What's left there is only the following:

  //
  // Process Asynchronous SMI sources
  //
  SmiManage (NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);


So...

- Are we supposed to write a new DXE_SMM_DRIVER for OvmfPkg, and call
gMmst->MmiHandlerRegister() in it, with HandlerType=NULL? (I.e.,
register a "root SMI handler"?)

- And then in the handler, should we read IO ports 0xB2 / 0xB3?

- Also, is that handler where we'd somehow sync up with the hot-plugged
VCPU, and finally call EFI_SMM_CPU_SERVICE_PROTOCOL.SmmAddProcessor()?

- Does it matter what (pre-existent) CPU executes the handler? (IOW,
does it matter what the value of gMmst->CurrentlyExecutingCpu is?)

Thanks,
Laszlo
