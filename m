Hi Peter,

So, I had to use temporary hardware resources to set this up (and set
it up countless times TBH).  I had the understanding based on the list
of machines you documented[1] that at least some of them would be used
for the permanent setup.

OK, I see it, now it makes more sense.  So we're "only" missing the
setup for the machines we'll use for the more permanent setup.  Would
you like to do a staged setup/migration using one or some of the
machines you documented?  I'm 100% onboard to help with this, meaning
that I can assist you with instructions, or do "pair setup" of the
machines if needed.  I think a good part of the evaluation here comes
down to how manageable/reproducible the setup is, so it'd make sense
for one to be part of the setup itself.

FIY there's also the possibility of grabbing some free VMs on GCP,
Azure, etc and setting them up as GitLab runners in a temporary way
(because of the temporarily free and VM nature).  I have a few
problems with this approach, including the fact that it doesn't yield
the complete experience wrt using hardware one owns and will have to
manage, besides the hardware limitations themselves.

Please let me know how you want to move on from here.

Cheers,
- Cleber.
