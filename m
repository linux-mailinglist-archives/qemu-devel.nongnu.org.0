Yeah, I'm curious why we're hitting such a call path, I think we were
designing this under the assumption we wouldn't see these.  I also
wonder if we really need to enforce the dma mapping range for getting
the dirty bitmap with the current implementation (unmap+dirty obviously
still has the restriction).  We do shift the bitmap in place for
alignment, but I'm not sure why we couldn't shift it back and only
clear the range that was reported.  Kirti, do you see other issues?  I
think a patch to lift that restriction is something we could plan to
include after the initial series is included and before we've committed
to the uapi at the v5.8 release.

I think this is relative to QEMU path 09/ where Yan had the questions
below on v16 and again tried to get answers to them on v22:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20200520031323.GB10369@joy-OptiPlex-7040/

Kirti, please address these questions.

This is my understanding of the protocol as well, when the device is
running, pending_bytes might drop to zero if no internal state has
changed and may be non-zero on the next iteration due to device
activity.  When the device is not running, pending_bytes reporting zero
indicates the device is done, there is no further state to transmit.
Does that meet your need/expectation?

The QEMU series does not need to be perfect, I kind of expect we might
see a few iterations of that beyond the kernel portion being accepted.
We should have the QEMU series to the point that we've resolved any
uapi issues though, which it seems like we're pretty close to having.
Ideally I'd like to get the kernel series into my next branch before
the merge window opens, where it seems like upstream is on schedule to
have that happen this Sunday.  If you feel we're to the point were we
can iron a couple details out during the v5.8 development cycle, then
please provide your reviewed-by.  We haven't fully committed to a uapi
until we've committed to it for a non-rc release.

I think the performance request was largely due to some conversations
with Dave Gilbert wondering if all this actually works AND is practical
for a LIVE migration.  I think we're all curious about things like how
much data does a GPU have to transfer in each phase of migration, and
particularly if the final phase is going to be a barrier to claiming
the VM is actually sufficiently live.  I'm not sure we have many
options if a device simply has a very large working set, but even
anecdotal evidence that the stop-and-copy phase transfers abMB from the
device while idle or xyzMB while active would give us some idea what to
expect.  Kirti, have you done any of those sorts of tests for NVIDIA's
driver?

Let's try to at least determine if this is a uapi issue or just a QEMU
implementation bug for progressing the kernel series.  Thanks,

Alex
