Hi,

Two important changes in this series:
- The ordering of the Topology List Entries, TLE, is done just
  before building the System information Buffer, SYSIB, during
  the interception of STSI.
  The adventage of this is to do the ordering only if it is needed
  whatever the reason for a change of the topology is, hotplug,
  qapi, instruction PTF(2) from the guest.

- query-topology is no longer needed, it is replaced by an
  extension of query-cpus-fast.

A small change that lead me to remove @Thomas RB:

- Add a trampolin function in cpu-topology code for the
  subsystem reset for extending to PTF reset in the following
  patch on PTF implementation.

@Nina and @Nico RB have been removed from reset patch too in the last
series because of small changes too.


Implementation discussions
==========================

CPU models
----------

Since the facility 11, S390_FEAT_CONFIGURATION_TOPOLOGY is already
in the CPU model for old QEMU we could not activate it as usual from
KVM but needed a KVM capability: KVM_CAP_S390_CPU_TOPOLOGY.
Checking and enabling this capability enables facility 11,
S390_FEAT_CONFIGURATION_TOPOLOGY.

It is the responsibility of the admin to ensure the same CPU
model for source and target host in a migration.

Migration
---------

When the target guest is started, the Multi-processor Topology Change
Report (MTCR) bit is set during the creation of the vCPU by KVM.
We do not need to migrate its state, in the worst case, the target
guest will see the MTCR and actualize its view of the topology
without necessity, but this will be done only one time.

Reset
-----

Reseting the topology is done during subsystem reset, the
polarization is reset to horizontal polarization.

Topology attributes
-------------------

The topology attributes are carried by the CPU object and defined
on object creation.
In the case the new attributes, socket, book, drawer, dedicated,
polarity are not provided QEMU provides defaults values.

- Geometry defaults
  The geometry default are based on the core-id of the core to 
  fill the geometry in a monotone way starting with drawer 0,
  book 0, and filling socket 0 with the number of cores per socket,
  then filling socket 1, socket 2 ... etc until the book is complete
  and all books until the first drawer is complete before starting with
  the next drawer.

  This allows to keep existing start scripts and Libvirt existing
  interface until it is extended.

- Modifiers defaults
  Default polarization is horizontal
  Default dedication is not dedicated.

Dynamic topology modification
-----------------------------

QAPI interface is extended with:
- a command: 'x-set-cpu-topology'
- a query: extension of 'query-cpus-fast'
- an event: 'CPU_POLARITY_CHANGE'

The admin may use query-cpus-fast to verify the topology provided
to the guest and x-set-cpu-topology to modify it.

The event CPU_POLARITY_CHANGE is sent when the guest successfuly 
uses the PTF(2) instruction to request a polarization change.
In that case, the admin is supposed to modify the CPU provisioning
accordingly.

Testing
=======

To use the QEMU patches, you will need Linux V6-rc1 or newer,
or use the following Linux mainline patches:

f5ecfee94493 2022-07-20 KVM: s390: resetting the Topology-Change-Report    
24fe0195bc19 2022-07-20 KVM: s390: guest support for topology function     
0130337ec45b 2022-07-20 KVM: s390: Cleanup ipte lock access and SIIF fac.. 

Currently this code is for KVM only, I have no idea if it is interesting
to provide a TCG patch. If ever it will be done in another series.

Documentation
=============

To have a better understanding of the S390x CPU Topology and its
implementation in QEMU you can have a look at the documentation in the
last patch of this series.

The admin will want to match the host and the guest topology, taking
into account that the guest does not recognize multithreading.
Consequently, two vCPU assigned to threads of the same real CPU should
preferably be assigned to the same socket of the guest machine.

Pierre
