Now, thinking longer about topN scripts, I think one really missing
thing is number of invocations (or calls, whatever term you prefer)
for any function in the list. This data must be possible to obtain
using callgrind_annotate (most likely by using --tree option). With
perf, i don't think this is possible, given that perf works based on
sampling.

You don't need to start working on it right now, or work on it at all
- this is more like a brainstorming suggestion from me. You can make
improvements and correction all the way towards the end of the
project, on Aug 31st.

At the end of the project, perhaps you can publish a "Master Project
Report" - a pdf that is basically a sum of all your reports produced
during the project. That would be a nice reading!

Regards,
Aleksandar
