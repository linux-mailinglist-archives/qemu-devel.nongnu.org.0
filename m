Subject: [PATCH] e1000: don't raise interrupt in pre_save()

We should not raise any interrupt after VM has been stopped but this
is what e1000 currently did when mit timer is active in
pre_save(). Fixing this by scheduling a timer in post_load() which can
make sure the interrupt was raised when VM is running.
