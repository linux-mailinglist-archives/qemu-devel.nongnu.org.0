Agreed. I'll rephrase the last paragraph a little bit:

The jobs are marked as "manual" only, since this double-indirect setup (with 
the cirrus-run script and VMs in the Cirrus-CI containers) might fail more 
often than the other jobs, and since we can trigger a limited amount of 
Cirrus-CI jobs at a time anyway (due to the restrictions in the free tier of 
Cirrus). Thus these jobs are rather added as convenience for contributors 
who would like to run the NetBSD/OpenBSD tests without the need of 
downloading and installing the corresponding VM images on their local machines.
