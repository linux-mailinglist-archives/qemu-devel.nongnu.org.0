Sure.

Libvirt detection works with this patch.

Alternatively, if I run qemu with kernel_irqchip=off and ais=true, I get:
qemu-system-s390x: Some features requested in the CPU model are not 
available in the configuration: ais

Which was the same result as Connie's proposal.

It reads a bit odd to me at first, but looking at the code quick I think 
this is the right answer - kvm_kernel_irqchip_allowed() will only return 
false when kernel_irqchip has been forced off as above, whereas 
kernel_irqchip_required will also return false in the case where no 
setting was specified (this is what tripped libvirt up).

Looks good to me, thanks Thomas.
