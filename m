vfio live migration is being worked on btw.

Yes, fw_cfg files can't be hotplugged, that is where this restriction
comes from.

Well, the whole point of using ramfb is that it is *not* a pci device,
but something you can attach to other devices as boot display.  Right
now we have that for vfio only, in theory it can likewise be done for
virtio (so you can use virtio-ramfb instead of virtio-vga for bios
display support).  Prototype exists.  Given that OVMF has a full
virtio-gpu driver there isn't much need for that though ...

Piggyback on the pci config space of the device you are attaching ramfb
to isn't going to work very well for unknown devices (i.e. vfio case).
For virtio it would have worked without too much trouble probably, using
a vendor capability to grab some register space.

For a separate pci device you can just use bochs-display.  Maybe add
some logic for the automagic display switching (i.e. if vfio has a valid
framebuffer use that and bochs-display otherwise).

cheers,
  Gerd
