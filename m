It's not nanoseconds or MB/s stored in theses fields, isn't it?
I'd specify units in which value is stored or drop units altogether.

Maybe Eric and Markus can suggest a better way to describe fields.

it's alignment requirement and it doesn't mean that value could not be
represented in bytes/s.
And it is bytes/s if suffix isn't used.

As for alignment and precision of values you probably need to document
expectations here as well.

opts_type_size() can't handle values >=3D 0xfffffffffffffc00

commit f46bfdbfc8f (util/cutils: Change qemu_strtosz*() from int64_t to uin=
t64_t)

so behavior would change depending on if the value is parsed by CLI (size) =
or QMP (unit64) parsers.

we can cannibalize 0x0 as the unreachable value and an absent bandwidth/lat=
 option
for not specified case.
It would be conflicting with matrix [1] values in spec, but CLI/QMP deals w=
ith
absolute values which are later processed into HMAT substructure.

Markus,
Can we make opts_type_size() handle full range of uint64_t?
