Agreed.  But hey, Makefile.objs is 2000 lines of lists of files, it is
boring but it cannot take that long to convert.  So it's not really
about being _possible_ to do it all at once, it's mostly about the
manageability of conflicts.

I cannot really make such a commitment now, but perhaps I can (or I and
someone else can) once a little more of the conversion is ready.
Especially QAPI and trace generators, since those are where most of the
magic resides.  I can try that since your reaction wasn't of total
disgust. :)

But even before that, we'll get *practical* reduction if it hacking the
Makefile rules and external scripts becomes rare enough.  See for
example kconfig, where # of people hacking minikconf.py is much less
than # of people hacking default-configs.

It's especially worth during the transition.  Once Makefile.objs is gone
I agree we can afford more radical changes, but let's cross that bridge
when we get there.

Fair enough.

It would be smaller since the DSL is more compact than shell scripts,
probably not much faster as the same tasks still have to be done.  But
perhaps in the future Meson can parallelize them, and then we'd get that
for free.
