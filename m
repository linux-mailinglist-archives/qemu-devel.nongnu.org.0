That is a pretty inflexible design for other use cases though,
as "non-essential" is not a black & white list in general. There
are varying levels of importance to the different channels. We
can afford to loose migration without any user visible effects.
If that doesn't solve it, a serial device chardev, or VNC connection
can be dropped at the inconvenience of loosing interactive console
which is end user visible impact, so may only be want to be yanked
if the migration yank didn't fix it.

Daniel
