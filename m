Which is because it wasn't relevant then: You were not allowed to meddle
with base when block-stream documentation was written. It's only a
possible case since commit c624b015.

If we really want to guarantee that it's exactly base that will be used
at the end, then we need to freeze all links down to base, essentially
reverting commit c624b015 and disallowing some operations that would be
possible if we didn't make that promise. I don't think that's the right
thing to do, but at least it would be self-consistent.

Promising base, but not freezing the links, leads to weird results in
some of the cases mentioned above.

Like undefined behaviour in C?

Sounds great, let's reboot the guest into some 512-byte demo then.

I think it is. A node name refers to the node with that name at the
time of the QMP command. What node was referenced in that command
doesn't change later because of graph manipulations.

Okay, added to my preliminary agenda.
