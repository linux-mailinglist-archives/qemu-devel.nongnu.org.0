They should have already been filled with the poison pattern before we
got to d). A bigger worry is that we at some point in the future
update the kernel so that d) doesn't trigger re-poisoning, in which
case the pages won't be marked as dirty, we will have skipped the
migration, and we have no idea what will be in the pages at the end.

The goal of the free page hinting was to reduce the number of pages
that have to be migrated, in the second case you point out is is
basically deferring it and will make the post-copy quite more
expensive since all of the free memory will be pushed to the post-copy
which I would think would be undesirable since it means the VM would
have to be down for a greater amount of time with the poisoning
enabled.

The worst case scenario would be one in which the VM was suspended for
migration while there were still pages in the balloon that needed to
be drained. In such a case you would have them in an indeterminate
state since the last page poisoning for them might have been ignored
since they were marked as "free", so they are just going to be
whatever value they were if they had been migrated at all.

Based on the timing I am guessing the page poisoning was in the same
patch set as the free page hinting since there is only 2 seconds
between when the two are merged. If I recall the page poisoning logic
was added after the issue was pointed out that it needed to address
it.

I can probably make some changes to virtballoon_validate in the kernel
driver to address the fact that if we are poisoning pages we need to
either have the PAGE_POISON feature or we need to disable page
reporting and page hinting.

Okay, I guess I can revert that bit.

I can drop it. I don't really recall why I added that piece.
