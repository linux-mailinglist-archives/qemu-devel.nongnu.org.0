Feels like nitpicking, but you say that functions are registered with a
name that you have previously registered. If you mean literally passing
a string, could this lead to callers forgetting to register it first?

Maybe yank_register_instance() should return something like a
YankInstance object that must be passed to yank_register_function().
Then you would probably also have a list of all functions registered for
a single instance so that yank_unregister_instance() could automatically
remove all of them instead of requiring the instance to do so.

I think it depends. If shutting down one connection basically kills the
functionality of the whole instance, there is no reason not to kill all
connections. But if the instance could continue working on the second
connection, maybe it shouldn't be killed.

Anyway, we can extend things as needed later. I already mentioned
elsewhere in this thread that block node-names have a restricted set of
allowed character, so having a suffix to distinguish multiple yankable
things is possible. I just checked chardev and it also restricts the
allowed set of characters, so the same applies. 'migration' is only a
fixed string, so it's trivially extensible.

So we know a path forward if we ever need to yank individual
connections, which is good enough for me.

Yes, this makes sense as a potential future use case.
