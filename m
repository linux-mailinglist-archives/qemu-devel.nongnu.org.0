"hidden" the way we use it for virtio-net failover is actually unplugged. B=
ut it
doesn't have to be that way. You can register a function that decides
if the device should be hidden, i.e. plugged now, or do something else
with it (in the virtio-net failover case we just save everything we
need to plug the device later). =20

We did introduce a "unplugged but not unrealized" function too as part
of the failover feature. See "a99c4da9fc pci: mark devices partially
unplugged"

This was needed so we would be able to re-plug the device in case a
migration failed and we need to hotplug the primary device back to the
guest. To avoid the risk of not getting the resources the device needs
we don't unrealize but just trigger the unplug from the guest OS.

Jens
