The wording is unclear. This migration scheme makes it possible but does
not require implementations to support advanced migration scenarios. A
VFIO/mdev driver or vfio-user device backend can refuse to instantiate
with certain device configuration parameters. For example, if version=3D1
is no longer supported in the latest device implementation then it can
return an error.

Compatibility is handled by the device model and configuration
parameters that are used to instantiate devices. If device model URIs
differ then the devices are incompatible (e.g.
https://vendor-a.com/rtl8139 and https://vendor-b.com/rtl8139). When
changes are made to the guest-visible hardware interface or device state
representation then they are toggled via configuration parameters (e.g.
rss=3Don|off).

Here is an example:

The device model is a network card as defined by the
https://vendor-a.com/my-nic device model. Receive Side Scaling (RSS) is
an optional feature and the configuration parameter rss=3Don|off toggles
its availability. When rss=3Don the RSS feature is available in the
hardware interface, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the guest
driver has to enable the feature.

Now we wish to migrate to another implementation of the same device
model. On the destination machine RSS is not available, so trying to
instantiate https://vendor-a.com/my-nic with rss=3Don will fail with an
error because the feature is unavailable (this could be because the
implementation doesn't support the feature or because the host lacks the
capability).

The following combinations are possible:

Source    Available   Result
          on Dest?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
rss=3Doff          no   OK.
rss=3Doff         yes   OK. rss=3Don is supported but we don't need it.
rss=3Don           no   FAIL. rss=3Don is not supported on destination!
rss=3Don          yes   OK.

By the way, this shows why this scheme is a conservative bound on
migration compatibility. If the guest driver hasn't enabled RSS and
won't be using it then we could potentially migrate rss=3Don even when the
destination does not support rss=3Don. But doing this reliably isn't
tractable so instead we use strict migration compatibility.

Regarding forking, if you want complete freedom you can pick a new
device model URI. Device instances using the old device model URI are
not considered compatible with the new device model URI. However, you
can then introduce changes to the hardware interface or device state
representation without agreement from the owner of the old device model
URI.

If instead you want to collaborate you can agree on changes with the
device model URI owner. You can change the device's hardware interface
and device state representation as described in this document.
Basically, each change must be reflect in a device configuration
parameter.

"Instantiating" means writing to the mdev "create" sysfs attr. I am not
very familiar with mdev so this could be totally wrong, but I'll try to
define a mapping:

1. The mdev driver sets up struct
   mdev_parent_opts->supported_type_groups as follows:

  /* Device model URI */
  static ssize_t model_show(struct kobject *kobj,
                            struct device *dev,
                            char *buf)
  {
      return sprintf(buf, "https://vendor-a.com/my-nic\n");
  }
  static MDEV_TYPE_ATTR_RO(model);

  /* Receive Side Scaling (RSS) */
  static ssize_t rss_show(struct kobject *kobj,
                          struct dev *dev,
=09=09=09  char *buf)
  {
      return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", ...->rss);
  }
  static ssize_t rss_store(struct kobject *kobj,
                           struct attribute *attr,
=09=09=09   const char *page,
=09=09=09   size_t count)
  {
      char *p =3D (char *) page;
      unsigned long val =3D simple_strtoul(p, &p, 10);

      ...->rss =3D !!val;
      return count;
  }
  static MDEV_TYPE_ATTR_RW(rss);

  /* Device version */
  static ssize_t version_show(struct kobject *kobj,
                              struct dev *dev,
=09=09=09      char *buf)
  {
      return sprintf(buf, "%u\n", ...->version);
  }
  static ssize_t version_store(struct kobject *kobj,
                               struct attribute *attr,
=09=09=09       const char *page,
=09=09=09       size_t count)
  {
      char *p =3D (char *) page;
      unsigned long val =3D simple_strtoul(p, &p, 10);

      /* Set device configuration parameters to their defaults */
      switch (version) {
      case 1:
          ...->rss =3D false;
=09  ...->version =3D 1;
=09  break;

      case 2:
          ...->rss =3D true;
=09  ...->version =3D 2;
=09  break;

      default:
          return -ENOTSUPP;
      }

      return count;
  }
  static MDEV_TYPE_ATTR_RW(rss);

  static struct attribute *mdev_type_my_nic_attrs[] =3D {
      &mdev_type_attr_model.attr,
      &mdev_type_attr_rss.attr,
      &mdev_type_attr_version.attr,
      NULL,
  };

  static struct attribute_group mdev_type_group_my_nic =3D {
      .name  =3D "my-nic", /* shorthand name */
      .attrs =3D mdev_type_my_nic_attrs,
  };

  struct attribute_group *supported_type_groups[] =3D {
      &mdev_type_group_my_nic,
      NULL,
  };

2. The userspace tooling enumerates supported device models by reading
   the "model" sysfs attr from each supported type attr group.

3. Userspace picks the device model it wishes to instantiate and sets
   the "version" sysfs attr and other device configuration parameters as
   desired.

4. Userspace instantiates the device by writing to the mdev "create" sysfs
   attr. If instantiation succeeds then migrating a device state saved
   by the same device model with the same configuration parameters is
   possible.

Maybe a cleaner way to structure this is to include the version as part
of the supported type group. So "my-nic" becomes "my-nic-1", "my-nic-2",
etc. There would still be a "version" sysfs attr but it would be
read-only. Device configuration parameters would only be present if they
were actually available in that version. For example, "my-nic-1" would
not expose an "rss" sysfs attr because it was introduced in "my-nic-2".
I see pros and cons to both the approach I outlined above and this
alternative, maybe someone more familiar with mdev has a preference?

The concept of device instantiation is natural for mdev and vfio-user,
but not essential.

When dealing with physical devices (even PCI SR-IOV), we don't need to
instantiate them explicitly. Device instances can already exist. As long
as we know their device model URI and configuration parameters we can
ensure migration compatibility.

For example, imagine a physical PCI NIC accompanied by a non-mdev VFIO
migration driver. The device model URI and configuration parameter
information can be distributed alongside the VFIO migration driver. It
could be available via modinfo(8), as a separate metadata file, via a
vendor-specific tool, etc.

Management tools need to match the device model/configuration from the
source device against the destination device. If the destination is
capable of supporting the source's device model/configuration then
migration can proceed safely.

Let's look at the case where we are migration from an older version of a
device to a newer version. On the source we have:

  model =3D https://vendor-a.com/my-nic

On the destination we have:

  model =3D https://vendor-a.com/my-nic
  rss =3D on

The two devices are incompatible because the destination exposes the RSS
feature that is not present on the source. The RSS feature involves
guest-visible hardware interface changes and a change to the device
state representation. It is not safe to migrate!

In this case an extra configuration step is necessary so that the
destination device can accept the device state from the source. The
management tool invokes a vendor-specific tool to put the device into
the right configuration:

  # vendor-tool set-migration-config --device 0000:00:04.0 \
                                     --model https://vendor-a.com/my-nic

(This tool only succeeds when the device is bound to VFIO but not yet
opened.)

The tool invokes ioctls on the vendor-specific VFIO driver that does two
things:
1. Tells the device to present the old hardware interface without RSS
2. Uses the old device state representation without RSS support

Does this approach fit?
