tl;dr: 'make distclean' isn't perfect (it still leaves 2 directories=20
behind), but does clean up a lot of directories and .mak files, and IS=20
necessary before you can build in the subdirectory; but at least make=20
warns you.  Still, I'd prefer adding that step in the warning, rather=20
than getting an error several steps later.
