Changes from unsigned to signed.  Audit of callers:

bdrv_aligned_pwritev() - adjusted this patch, safe
bdrv_do_pdiscard() - passes int64_t, safe
bdrv_co_copy_range_internal() - passes int64_t, safe
bdrv_do_truncate() - passes int64_t, safe

Internal usage:

assertions that things fit within 63 bits.  Safe

[The req->overlap_offset+ req->overlap_bytes calculation used to be 
unsigned, but was changed to be signed earlier in this series]

Similar to the above; same four callers, all pass int64_t.


>       int64_t end_sector = DIV_ROUND_UP(offset + bytes, BDRV_SECTOR_SIZE);

This computation needs analysis.  Previously, we had:

DIV_ROUND_UP(int64_t + uint64_t, unsigned long long)
which expands to:
(((uint64_t) + (ull) - int) / (ull))
which simplifies to uint64_t.

Now we have:
DIV_ROUND_UP(int64_t + int64_t, ull)
Okay, in spite of our argument changing type, the macro still results in 
a 64-bit unsigned answer.  Either way, that answer fits within 63 bits, 
so it is safe when assigned to int64_t.

Also in this function:
             stat64_max(&bs->wr_highest_offset, offset + bytes);
in include/qemu/stats64.h, takes uint64_t parameter, but we're passing a 
positive 63-bit number - safe
             bdrv_set_dirty(bs, offset, bytes);
in block/dirty-bitmap.c, takes int64_t parameter - safe

>   {

changes signature from unsigned 32-bit to signed 64-bit.  callers:

bdrv_co_do_zero_pwritev() - passes int64_t, but that was clamped to 
either pad.buf_len [BdrvRequestPadding uses 'size_t buf_len', but 
initializes it in bdrv_init_padding() to at most 2*align] or align set 
from BlockLimits.request_alignment (naturally uint32_t, but documented 
as 'a power of 2 less than INT_MAX' which is at most 1G), so the old 
code never overflowed, and the new code introduces no change

Perhaps we should separately fix BdrvRequestPadding to use a saner type 
than size_t for continuity between 32- and 64-bit platforms (perhaps 
uint32_t rather than int64_t, since we know our padding is bounded by 
request_alignment), but it doesn't impact this patch

bdrv_do_pwritev_part() - still passes unsigned int at this point in the 
series, safe

Usage within the function:

Previously we widened unsigned 32-bit into unsigned 64-bit; now we use 
signed 64-bit unchanged.

qiov->size is only size_t, while 'qiov_offset + bytes' changed from 
'size_t + unsigned int' to 'size_t + int64_t'.  The resulting type of 
the computation changes for some platforms, but the assertion is proving 
that things still fit (including in 32 bits, when size_t is constrained).

     ret = bdrv_co_write_req_prepare(child, offset, bytes, req, flags);
also touched in this patch, safe

         qemu_iovec_is_zero(qiov, qiov_offset, bytes)) {
Passes an 'int64_t' to a 'size_t' parameter, which is possibly 
narrowing.  Fortunately, the assertions just above prove that by this 
point, we are constrained by qiov->size, which is also size_t. Safe.

         ret = bdrv_co_do_pwrite_zeroes(bs, offset, bytes, flags);
Passes to int64_t, safe

         ret = bdrv_driver_pwritev_compressed(bs, offset, bytes,
Passes to int64_t, safe

         ret = bdrv_driver_pwritev(bs, offset, bytes, qiov, qiov_offset, 
flags);
Passes to int64_t, safe

             ret = bdrv_driver_pwritev(bs, offset + bytes - bytes_remaining,
                                       num, qiov, bytes - bytes_remaining,
Passes int64_t to size_t parameter, but the previous assertion proved we 
did not overflow qiov->size which is size_t. Safe
