Hello, Libo,

Prerequisite for writing a helper is that you have a clear definition of
new instruction functionality, in the sense, what operation is done on what
resources. "Resources" are registers - they could be general-purpose MIPS
registers, or some special additional registers. Did you use existing
registers, or did you define a new set or registers for your new
instructions? Registers are modeled as fields in a structure, and both
helpers and TCG implementations modify those fields while performing
instruction emulation.

In any case, you pass to the helper all information needed for the
instruction in question to perform. These are usually ordinal numbers of
involved register, derived from decoding the opcode. Alternatively, you can
pass pointers to the registers, rather than ordinal numbers. In turn, the
main part of functionality is implemented. At the end of helper, you may
want to update, let's say, a status register, if any (depending on your
design).

The declaration of helpers is a little contrived, and may still confuse
you. But this is not crucial to you. I advise you just to copy a solution
for a similar existing instruction.

Yours,
Aleksandar
