Title:
  Sending certain keysyms results in wrong symbol input

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I develop bVNC, an Android VNC client. I noticed that when I connect
  to qemu VMs that have a VNC console, Keysyms that are usually sent
  over with SHIFT modifier when connecting from a PC have wrong symbols
  typed within the VM. A very short list of examples:

  exclam                              33     0x0021

  results in "1" typed in the VM.

  at                                  64     0x0040

  results in "2"

  plus                                43     0x002b

  results in "=3D"

  asterisk                            42     0x002a

  results in "8"

  On Android, KEYCODEs that correspond to the above keysyms do not come
  with SHIFT metastate. Therefore, the keysyms that they correspond to
  are not sent over with any modifiers and must just work.

  The issue was reproduced with bVNC and RealVNC viewers connecting to
  many versions of qemu (Ubuntu 14.04, oVirt 3.4, oVirt 4.1, etc.). The
  qemu version that comes with oVirt 4.1 is 2.6.0, commit hash
  bfc766d38e1fae5767d43845c15c79ac8fa6d6af.

  Sincerely,
  iordan
