The 3-clause BSD license is compatible with the GPL according to
Wikipedia:

In the early stages where the vfio-user protocol and library interfaces
might need changes it will be hard to use it from multiple applications
without compatibility issues. If SPDK/DPDK are communicating with QEMU
using a cutting-edge library then they probably need to build QEMU from
source anyway. ISTR they also maintain a QEMU fork? So maybe it's not a
big issue for them.

Me too, no solution is perfect. My thoughts about developing it within
qemu.git for now is that this will make protocol and library interface
changes easy. It will also encourage applications (DPDK/SPDK) to build
against a matching QEMU so that there are no compatibility problems at
the protocol or library level while the code is still heavily under
development.
