How could this succeed?  Either set_vfp or set_neon would be called first, at
which point the two features are temporarily out of sync, but the error would
trigger anyway.

This would seem to require some separate "qmp validate" step that is processed
after a collection of properties are set.

I was about to say something about this being moot until someone actually wants
to be able to disable vfp+neon on aarch64, but then...

... this language makes me think that you've already encountered an ordering
problem that might be better solved with a separate validate step?

The actual code looks good.
