That's the first motivation, indeed.

This would change the signature of the function, and would need an
interface version bump.

Alternative: pass optional arguments as an extra dictionary. This is a
common idiom in D-Bus (the "a{sv}" type that maps strings to generic
values)

Potentially, use gvariant serialization format, which has maybe type.
But gvariant isn't implemented by most D-Bus libraries (that was the
plan long time ago, but it didn't happen as people lost interest).

> * Adding results

Also change the signature of the function.

However, since messages have boundaries, it is easy to ignore return values=
.

As long as the discriminant is represented as a string, it should be fine.

> * Reordering members of enumerations, structs, unions

Again, if the discriminant is a string, it should be the same as with json.

For the members, the usage of dictionaries is required in this case
(else the type signature would change).

> * Turning an argument type into an alternate with the old type as branch

That would also change the function signature.

There isn't much solution I can think of, unless we have an implicit
tagged enum for every argument, which would be quite nasty.

The introspection XML will always reflect the expected signature. You
should bump your interface version whenever you make incompatible
changes.

If this happens too often, we could also introduce a D-Bus override
mechanism to do manual translations from external interface to
internal.
