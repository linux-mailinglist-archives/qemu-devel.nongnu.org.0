Sure, if you want to cope with that you can just use the HW watchdog
directly instead of via systemd.=20

Same points repeated below, so I'll respond there....

Of course, the inability to predict future consequences is what
forces us into assuming the worst case & taking actions to
mitigate that. It will definitely result in unccessary killing
of hosts, but that is what gives you the safety guarantees you
can't otherwise achieve.

I gave the example elsewhere that even if you kill QEMU, the kernel
can have pending I/O associated with QEMU that can be sent if the
host later recovers.

I don't believe its viable to have offer real protection to only
a subset of VMs, principally because the kernel is doing I/O work
on behalf of the VM, so to protect just 1 VM you must fence the
kernel.

Just abort()'ing isn't going to be a viable strategy with QEMU's move
towards a multi-process architecture. This introduces the problem that
the "main" QEMU process has to enumerate all the helpers it is dealing
with and kill them all off in some way. This is non-trivial especially
if some of the helpers are running under different privilege levels.

You could declare that multi-process QEMU is out of scope, but I think
QEMU self-fencing would need to offer compelling benefits over host OS
self-fencing to justify that exception. Personally I'm not seeing it.

> 2) Kernel sends SIGKILL (harddeadline)

This is slightly easier to deal with multiple processes in that it
isn't restricted by the privileges of the main QEMU vs helpers and
could take advantage of cgroups perhaps.
