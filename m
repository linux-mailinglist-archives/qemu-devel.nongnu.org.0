Hello, Rajath!

Thank you for expressing interest in QEMU open source project.

There is certainly a place for you and your contributions in QEMU, and you
are very welcomed!

It looks to me the following project would fit your description:

'Implement emulation of DS3231 real time clock in QEMU'

Datasheet:

https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS3231.pdf

The steps needed to complete it (in my opinion):

- collect datasheets of as many as possible RTC chips already emulated in
QEMU (there are around of dozen of them, see folder hw/rtc)

- do a comparative analysis of selected RTC implementations in QEMU

- get to know general QEMU device model

- design and implement DS3231 emulation

I can give you (unfortunately constrained by tight time limits) some help
and guidance. But there are other people in community too (more
knowledgable in the area than me).

I salute your initiative!

Yours,
Aleksandar
