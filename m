I=E2=80=99m not talking about the vmware case here.
If you introduce MBR guessing into SeaBIOS and change its default =
behaviour you
risk making operating systems such as Windows XP / 2003 / 2000 created =
on
QEMU to not work anymore.

Example:

	Consider a Windows XP that works with the following geometries =
on standard
	QEMU/SeaBIOS today:
=09
	Disk is very large, therefore INT13 AH=3D02:

		255 heads, 63 spt

	Now you change SeaBIOS to guess from the MBR.
	In some cases the MBR guess can be incorrect so now SeaBIOS will =
guess:

		255 heads, 62 spt

	The guest no longer boots with these geometries and you broke =
compatibility.
=09
Can there be a guest that will fail the MBR in such a way? Yes.
Look at the following MBR partition table of a Windows XP guest in our =
production
environment:

Disk size in sectors: 16777216

Binary (only one partition 16 bytes): 80 01 01 00 07 fe ff ff 3f 00 00 =
00 d5 ea ff 00
Start: (0, 1, 1, 63)
End: (1023, 254, 63, 16771859)

As can be easily seen, any MBR guessing algorithm should guess:

	255 heads (since a value of 254 appears), 63 spt (since a value =
of 63 appears)

Turns out that this image does not work with 255, 63 but actually =
requires

	16 heads, 63 spt

to boot.

So relying on MBR partitions alone is not always enough and sometimes =
manual intervention
is required.

(VMware solves this by specifying 16 heads, 63 spt in the descriptor =
file and overrides its
default guessing algorithm which also fails here)

(By the way this is not a VMware specific problem, the disk itself was =
imported to VMware in
a P2V scenario, so that probably explains why the ddb.geometry.bios* =
values appear in the
VMDK in the first place)
