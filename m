Would be new command useful tough? What we end up is broken guest
(if I read commit message right) and a user who has no idea if=20
device_add was successful or not.
So what user should do in this case
  - wait till it explodes?
  - can user remove it or it would be stuck there forever?
  - poll slot before hotplug, manually?

(if this is the case then failing device_add cleanly doesn't sound bad,
it looks similar to another error we have "/* Check if hot-plug is disabled=
 on the slot */"
in pcie_cap_slot_pre_plug_cb)

CCing libvirt, as it concerns not only QEMU.

For CPUs and RAM, device_add can fail so maybe management is also
prepared to handle errors on PCI hotplug path.
