Suggest to scratch "explicitly".

Suggest "if the compression type bit (incompatible feature bit 3) is
set", for consistency with existing references to incompatible feature
bits.

This sentence is redundant with "if and only if".  Suggest to drop it.

Suggest "not set, and".

I find this sentence confusing.  Can we drop it?

Suggest "QEMU versions older than 4.1 can only use images created with

Please add brief explanations with pointers to additional information
for both.  Something like

       0: zlib compression, see <http://zlib.net/>
       1: zstd compression, see FIXME

Mention RFC 1950, 1951 and 1952 for zlib if you like.

More laconic: the image cluster compression method.

I.e. it can't be changed.  Perhaps: "The compression method is fixed at
image creation time.  To change it, you have to use qemu-img convert."

Hmm.  BlockdevOptionsQcow2 has the qcow2-specific options for -blockdev.
What does passing @compression-type to -blockdev mean?  The actual
compression type is determined by the qcow2 image...  Am I confused?

Two nits.  One, we don't normally put spaces before the colon.  Two,
compressor vs. compression.

But I'd suggest something like

    @zlib: zlib compression, see <http://zlib.net/>

Mention RFC 1950, 1951 and 1952 if you like.

Same for @zstd.

The default is "zlib", not "zlib(gzip)".  If you want to explain what
zlib is, do it in Qcow2CompressionType's doc string.
