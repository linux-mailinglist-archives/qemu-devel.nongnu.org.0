Rather than adding_device_allowed, something like "query slot"
might be helpful for debugging. That would help user figure out
e.g. why isn't device visible without any races.

I think we want QEMU management interface to be reasonably
abstract and agnostic if possible. Pushing knowledge of hardware
detail to management will just lead to pain IMHO.
We supported device_add which practically never fails for years,
at this point it's easier to keep supporting it than
change all users ...
