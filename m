There's no need for fips_get_state. Once you build QEMU with
libgcrypt, when  VNC requests a DES cipher handle, gcrypt will
return an error as that algorithm is forbidden in FIPS mode.

This is the primary reason for outsourcing all crypto to a
separate library and ignoring the impls in QEMU.

Claiming QEMU is FIPS compliant without using libgcrypt is a
bit of joke since we don't do any self-tests of ciphers, hence
this deprecation notice is warning people that libgcrypt is
going to be mandatory if you care about FIPS.

I just would rather not change semantics of something that we are
intending to remove
