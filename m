you can ask the question but not sure I can answer ;-)

1) SMMUv3 2stage implementation is blocked by Will at kernel level.

Despite this situation I may/can respin as Marvell said they were
interested in this effort. If you are also interested in (I know you
tested it several times and I am grateful to you for that), please reply
to:
[PATCH v9 00/14] SMMUv3 Nested Stage Setup (IOMMU part)
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11039871/) and say you are
interested in that work so that maintainers are aware there are
potential users.

At the moment I have not supported multiple CDs because it introduced
other dependencies.

2) virtio-iommu

So only virtio-iommu dt boot on machvirt is currently supported. For non
DT, Jean respinned his kernel series
"[PATCH v2 0/3] virtio-iommu on x86 and non-devicetree platforms" as you
may know. However non DT integration still is controversial. Michael is
pushing for putting the binding info the PCI config space. Joerg
yesterday challenged this solution and said he would prefer ACPI
integration. ACPI support depends on ACPI spec update & vote anyway.

To support PASID at virtio-iommu level you also need virtio-iommu API
extensions to be proposed and written + kernel works. So that's a long
road. I will let Jean-Philippe comment on that.

I would just say that Intel is working on nested paging solution with
their emulated intel-iommu. We can help them getting that upstream and
partly benefit from this work.

> Would you mind give some breakdown.

Do you mean support of multiple CDs in the emulated SMMU? That's a thing
I could implement quite easily. What is more tricky is how to test it.
