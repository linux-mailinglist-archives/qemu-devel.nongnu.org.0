It would be a change in behaviour: Currently, I can specify e.g.

-device virtio-gpu-pci,disable-legacy=off,disable-modern=true

and the code in the realize function would force it to a modern-only
device. Checking in the plugged function would cause it to fail. This
might be preferable, but could break existing command lines.

Note that ccw is different: if I specify

-device virtio-gpu-ccw,max_revision=0

it actually fails with

qemu-system-s390x: -device virtio-gpu-ccw,max_revision=0: Invalid value of property max_rev (is 0 expected >= 1)

so moving to the plugged function would not cause a change in behaviour
from the user's point of view.

That should not be a problem for ccw (as transitional and
non-transitional are the same on the command line); moreover, people
are unlikely to set max_revision themselves (this is usually only done
by compat machines).

If changing the behaviour for pci is acceptable, we can sure move to
the plugged approach.
