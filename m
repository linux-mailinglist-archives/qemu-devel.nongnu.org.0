Libvirt has never produced a qemu command line containing '-snapshot'.=20
Part of this is that libvirt wants to control SELinux settings, and=20
letting qemu create a temporary overlay in /tmp in order to implement=20
-snapshot does not play nicely with libvirt pre-creating all files that=20
qemu is allowed to access.

The fact that you were able to manually add -snapshot to your qemu=20
command line with older libvirt using -drive (I'm assuming you were also=20
not using libvirt's SELinux support, because if you were, qemu would=20
have been unable to create/access the temporary wrapper in /tmp), is a=20
nice hack.  But since modern qemu has declared -snapshot to be=20
unsupported with -blockdev, and modern libvirt has switched to=20
-blockdev, I claim that this is not a qemu bug, but a libvirt feature=20
request.

That said, libvirt has had a vision for a design for implementing the=20
equivalent of -drive -snapshot: the <transient/> sub-element added to=20
the domain/disk/source/driver element has been documented for a long time:

https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html
"transient
     If present, this indicates that changes to the device contents=20
should be reverted automatically when the guest exits. With some=20
hypervisors, marking a disk transient prevents the domain from=20
participating in migration or snapshots. Since 0.9.5 "

However, no one has yet implemented it for libvirt's qemu driver.  Part=20
of our reluctance has been that we knew that implementing it would=20
require libvirt to precreate the wrapper file on every guest start, and=20
it is only very recently that we've even had enough functionality in=20
libvirt's qemu driver coupled with new qemu commands to create qcow2=20
images using QMP rather than having to shell out to qemu-img.  And part=20
of it is that there was no point in implementing something to work with=20
-drive, when we knew we had to rework everything for -blockdev anyways.=20
But now that the work in libvirt to switch to -blockdev is done, it=20
should be a lot easier to implement PROPER support for the <transient/>=20
tag, at least for -blockdev usage.
