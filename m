The goal is to test and validate the software running on the vp. We want
to generate some fault to test if the software behave correctly. We
target corner cases that do not happen otherwise on the vp. Basically we
would like, using some scripts, to run some specific scenarios and check
that the expected behavior happens.

Regarding qtest, I was not aware that it provided such commands. I'm
sorry I've missed that. Just checked after reading your feedback,
commands seem indeed equivalent. I don't know if running the vp with
qtest enabled has some hidden drawbacks. But if that's not the case, we
can work to extend the existing qtest commands (or switch some of them
to QMP like Philippe proposed, I don't know what's best).

Good point.

The only fault injection naming was for the python module. I suppose
that if we just extend qtest, there is no need for a new module or
documentation file.

Thanks,
