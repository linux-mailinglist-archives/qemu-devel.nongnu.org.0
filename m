OpenStack will detach/reattach PCI devices around a save-to-disk, but
does not currently do that for live migration, but easily could do. The
blocker why they've not done that is the issue around exposing to the
guest which pairs of devices are intended to be used together in the
bond.

OpenStack could have defined a way to express that, but it would be
specific to OpenStack which is not very desirable. Standardization
of how to express the relationship between the pair of devices would
be very desirable, allowing the host side solution to be done in either
QEMU or the mgmt app as they see fit.
