Uh... at the moment of setting the breakpoint, or the moment of
hitting the breakpoint.

Uh... but isn't the whole point here that the state of mmu_on might
not match the MSR state.  So the two sentences above don't seem to
mesh together.

What I think I'm understanding from the code is that in order to *set*
the breakpoint, you need to set up the MSR to match what you expect it
will be when you *hit* the breakpoint.  Yes?

But since the breakpoint is always placed in an interrupt vector,
won't that always be real mode?  Or is this one of the vectors that
can be entered in virtual mode on recent chips?

But AFAICT the mmu_on flag you're setting here has influences other
than tracking AIL.
