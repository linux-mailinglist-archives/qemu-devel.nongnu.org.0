The error message and qapi-code-gen.txt consistently spell it free-form.
I prefer consistent spelling, not least for greppability.

Yes.

My mistake, I overlooked the "A" at the end of the line.

Eric, what's your take?

No argument.  But...

... consistency with real Enum costs us nothing, so let's do it.

It's okay.

Not just to you.

There's more than one way to code a state machine.  Encoding the state
as enum / switch over next state is one.  Encoding the state as pointer
/ jump to next state is another.
