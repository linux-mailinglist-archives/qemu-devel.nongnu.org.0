I've now read the commit message on QEMU commit 258fe08bd341d, and the
complexity is simply stunning.

Right now, OVMF calculates the guest physical address space size from
various range sizes (such as hotplug memory area end, default or
user-configured PCI64 MMIO aperture), and derives the minimum suitable
guest-phys address width from that address space size. This width is
then exposed to the rest of the firmware with the CPU HOB (hand-off
block), which in turn controls how the GCD (global coherency domain)
memory space map is sized. Etc.

If QEMU can provide a *reliable* GPA width, in some info channel (CPUID
or even fw_cfg), then the above calculation could be reversed in OVMF.
We could take the width as a given (-> produce the CPU HOB directly),
plus calculate the *remaining* address space between the GPA space size
given by the width, and the end of the memory hotplug area end. If the
"remaining size" were negative, then obviously QEMU would have been
misconfigured, so we'd halt the boot. Otherwise, the remaining area
could be used as PCI64 MMIO aperture (PEI memory footprint of DXE page
tables be darned).

I don't know what exactly those flags do, but I doubt they are clearly
visible to OVMF in any particular way.

Thanks
