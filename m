Adding Alexandre Belloni and the RTC list to Cc for more expertise. Alexand=
re,
this question is about how qemu-user should emulate the rtc ioctl interface=
 when
running a user binary for a foreign architecture. The ioctl emulation seems=
 fine
to me, but read() from /dev/rtc is probably not.

As I understand it, reading from /dev/rtc is one of the more obscure featur=
es.
This would return either 32 bits or 64 bits of structured data from the ker=
nel,
depending on how much data was requested and whether the kernel runs
as 64 bit. A 32-bit process running on a 64-bit kernel will get the correct
result when it asks for 4 bytes, but probably not when it asks for 8 bytes.
(we could fix this with an explict check for in_compat_syscall() in the ker=
nel
function).

A process running on qemu with the opposite endianess will always get the
wrong result (unless the kernel returns 0), and emulating 64-bit task on
a 32-bit kernel will result in only four bytes to be read, which also likel=
y
results in incorrect behavior.
