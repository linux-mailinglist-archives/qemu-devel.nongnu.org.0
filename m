Well, this is larger than I expected.

I started off thinking conversion to decodetree would be quick,
after I reviewed the mttcg patches last week.  Then I realized
that this could also use conversion to the generic translation loop.
Then I realized that there were a number of bugs, and some
inefficiencies, that could be fixed by using tcg exception unwind
properly.

Hopefully most of these are small and easy to understand.

I begin by adding enough stuff to test/tcg to make use of a
self-built musl cross-environment.  I'll note that linuxtest
does not pass before or after this patch set -- I think that
linux-user/microblaze/signal.c needs work -- but that the
other tests do work.

I also have an old copy of a microblaze system test image,
which I think used to be hosted on our wiki.  After basic kernel
boot, it contains a "selftest" script which runs a bunch of
user-land isa tests.  That still works fine too.

HOWEVER: That's not nearly complete.  There are cpu config options
that aren't default and I don't know how to change or test.

In addition, the manual is really not clear on what's supposed to
happen under various edge conditions, especially with MSR[EE] unset.
E.g. unaligned access: Does the insn get nop-ed out?  Do the low
bits of the address get ignored?  Right now (before and after) the
access simply happens unaligned, which doesn't seem correct.
I assume the reason for having this configure option is to reduce
the size of the FPGA so that the unaligned access handling hw
simply isn't present.

Lemme know what you think.
