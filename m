This is a chicken and egg problem: you need the IPA size to compute
the memory map, and you need the memory map to compute the IPA
size. Fun, isn't it?

At the moment, virt_set_memmap() doesn't know about the IPA space,
generates a highest_gpa that may not work, and we end-up failing
because the resulting VM type is out of bound.

My solution to that is to feed the *maximum* IPA size to
virt_set_memmap(), compute the memory map there, and then use
highest_gpa to compute the actual IPA size that is used to create the
VM. By knowing the IPA limit in virt_set_memmap(), I'm able to keep it
in check and avoid generating an unusable memory map.

I've tried to make that clearer in my v4. Hopefully I succeeded.

Thanks,

	M.
