The tricky part is to know which variant of a particular feature name we
should use when talking to a specific version of QEMU. But I guess we
can use the new "unavailable-features" property for this purpose. When
the property is present, we can translate all feature names to their
canonical names (via a static translation table in libvirt). We'd be
using the old untranslated names when talking to any QEMU which does not
support the "unavailable-features" property.

But I hope we won't get into a situation when some CPU feature needs to
be renamed again, that would make a big mess.
