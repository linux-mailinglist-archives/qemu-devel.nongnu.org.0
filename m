Quoting new commit log:

	This makes sure the pci config space allocation is big enough,
	so accessing the PCIe extended config space doesn't overflow
	the pci config space buffer.

	PCI(e) config space is guest writable.  Writes are limited
	bywrite mask (which probably is also filled with random stuff),
	so the guest can only flip enabled bits.  But I suspect it
	still might be exploitable, so rather serious because it might
	be a host escape for the guest.  On the other hand the device
	is probably not yet in widespread use.

	Mitigation: use "-device bochs-display" as conventional pci
	device only.

Is it clear to others that this mitigation remark seems to be
referencing an alternative configuration constraint to avoid the issue
rather than what's actually implemented in this patch?  IOW, if we
never place the bochs-display device into a PCIe hierarchy, then
extended config space is never accessible to the guest anyway, and
there is no issue.  I think this was meant to be an alternative to the
patch but the enforcement of that would happen above QEMU, probably why
it was mentioned in the cover letter rather than the original commit
log.  Thanks,

Alex
