I'm just worried about the fragility of multiple steps in the chain of
io we are snooping on. That said Phillipe made a reasonable point that
other tools could be used - QMP for example would be the way to check
the status of the network connection before we trigger ssh rather than
the current busy-timeout approach. However that would result in more
complexity so if what works is stable...*shrug*

We currently do both ;-)

When we can detect at configure time and skip in make we do - see
tests/docker/Makefile.include and the compiler tests for tests/tcg.
However the acceptance tests current use runtime decorators in python to
detect as we go - but that test framework prints a summary and doesn't
exit -1 to the rest of make if it skips something.=20

Have a look at:
