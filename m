We currently depend on the guest behaviors to test the correctness of 
TCG backend. And if the guest doesn't
behave correctly, it is hard to find the exact bug in backend.

Maybe I can run RISU on qemu-aarch64(x86) and qemu-aarch64(risc-v) to 
check the RISC-V backend.

We already have many ISAs as the front end of TCG. Will the virtual 
processor here be some
different?

Sorry, I don't get it.

If I can find a  good way, I really like to do some further work.

Thanks，
