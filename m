It's the entry point, which isn't quite the same thing as
the start of the image (if we just loaded an ELF file then
'entry' is whatever the ELF file said the entrypoint is, which
could be a long way into the image).

loader_start here really means "base of RAM". I think what
we want here is something like

  info->initrd_start = info->loader_start + MIN(info->ram_size / 2,
128 * 1024 * 1024);
  info->initrd_start = MAX(info->initrd_start, kernel_end);

where kernel_end is just past whatever the highest addr of the kernel
is, which is not something that's totally trivial to calculate
with the variables we have to hand at this point.
