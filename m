I'm on 5.0-rc4 add a few patches implementing a subset of drm/amdgpu
support, with mesa-utils 8.4.0-1. Important note I guess: I can't get
the crash to trigger under llvmpipe/softrast, I can only get it on
RadeonSI. I valgrind'd qemu only to not find anything on the host-side.
I'm 99% sure this isn't a memory corruption bug from my patches, anyway,
and it's not replicable on upstream qemu because DRM simply isn't
functional. (Oh dear, I think I might be on my own until I can get this
stuff upstreamed.)

Title:
  Constant Folding on 64-bit Subtraction causes SIGILL on linux-user
  glxgears ppc64le to x86_64 by way of generating bad shift instruction
  with c=3D-1

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello, I've been recently working on my own little branch of QEMU
  implementing the drm IOCTLs, when I discovered that glxgears seems to
  crash in GLXSwapBuffers(); with a SIGILL. I investigated this for
  about 2 weeks, manually trying to trace the call stack, only to find
  that we seemingly crash in a bad shift instruction. Originally
  intended to be an shr_i64 generated to an RLDICL, we end up with an
  all ones(-1) c value, which gets thrown to the macro for generating
  the MB, and replaces the instruction with mostly ones. This new
  instruction, FFFFFFE0 is invalid on ppc64le, and crashes in a host
  SIGILL in codegen_buffer. I tried to see if the output of translate.c
  had this bad instruction, but all I got were two (shr eax, cl)
  instructions, and upon creating a test program with shr (eax, cl) in
  it, nothing happened. Then figuring that there was nothing actually
  wrong with the instruction in the first place, I turned my eye to the
  optimizer, and completely disabled constant folding for arithmetic
  instructions.  This seemed to actually resolve the issue, and then I
  slowly enabled constant folding again on various instructions only to
  find that enabling not on the shifts, but on subtraction seemed to
  cause the bug to reappear. I am bewildered and frankly at this point
  I'm not sure I have a chance in hell of figuring out what causes it,
  so I'm throwing it here.
