For arm64, so far we've not even been considering DT-based hotplug - as 
far as I'm aware there would still be a big open question there around 
notification mechanisms and how to describe them. The DT stuff so far 
has come from the PowerPC folks, so it's probably worth seeing what 
their ideas are.

ACPI-wise I've always assumed/hoped that hotplug-related things should 
be sufficiently well-specified in UEFI that "do whatever x86/IA-64 do" 
would be enough for us.
