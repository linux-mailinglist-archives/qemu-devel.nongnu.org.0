You were right, I forked the project again as public and can run CI
pipelines. I note this is different that my previous account, I am
restricted at 15 jobs at a time, so this is slower.

A also added '##.gl-alert-danger.gl-alert' rule to uBlock Origin plugin
to remove the annoying big red panel saying I'm out of minutes and have
to buy more.
