I'll provide a better overview in my next cover letter.

I'm not sure what we can say about this apart from "ask your lawyer".
I'm certainly not proposing we add any sort of language about what
should and shouldn't be allowed to use the plugin interface. I find it
hard to see how anyone could argue code written to interface with the
plugin API couldn't be considered a derived work.

There are two use cases I have in mind:

The first is FLOSS developers writing interesting tools that can take
advantage of QEMU's control of the system to do experiments that are
tricky with other setups (Valgrind is limited to same-arch, Dynamo/Pin
are user-space only). I want these experiments to be easy to do without
having to keep hacking and re-hacking QEMU's core code. I would hope
QEMU developers would up-stream theirs into the QEMU source tree but I
can imagine academics will have open source code that will only ever sit
in their paper's repository.

The other is users who currently maintain hacked up internal copies of
QEMU as a test bed for whatever piece of silicon they are brewing behind
closed doors. This code would never be distributed (hence never be a GPL
issue) and is generally kept private because it's IP sensitive
(e.g: experimenting with different cache models). If we can provide an
interface that allows them to keep their experiments private and
separate from changes to the core code then maybe apart from making
their lives a bit easier we will see some non-IP sensitive contributions
come back to the upstream. I live in hope ;-)
