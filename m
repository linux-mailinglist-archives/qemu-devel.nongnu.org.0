Thanks, I will have a deeper dive into it, however the issues with
changing host memory, migration, and all that extra is of no concern or
use to us.

The audience that will be using this interface is not interested in
such features as the primary reason for Looking Glass is to allow a for
high-performance windows workstation for gaming and proprietary windows
only software. In these scenarios features like ram ballooning are
avoided like the plague as it hampers performance for use cases that
require consistent low latency for competitive gameplay.

As the author of Looking Glass, I also have to consider the maintenance
and the complexity of implementing the vhost protocol into the project.
At this time a complete Porthole client can be implemented in 150 lines
of C without external dependencies, and most of that is boilerplate
socket code. This IMO is a major factor in deciding to avoid vhost-user.

I also have to weigh up the cost of developing and maintaining the
windows driver for this device. I am very green when it comes to Windows
driver programming, it took weeks to write the first IVSHMEM driver, and
several days to write the Porthole driver which is far simpler than the
IVSHMEM driver. I'd hate to think of the time investment in maintaining
the vhost integration also (yes, I am aware there is a library).

These drivers are not complex and I am sure an experienced windows
driver developer could have thrown them together in a few hours, but
since our requirements are so niche and of little commercial value those
in our community that are using this project do not have the time and/or
ability to assist with the drivers.

 From my point of view, avoiding vhost-use seems like a better path to
take as I am able (and willing) to maintain the Porthole device in QEMU,
the OS drivers, and client interface. The Porthole device also doesn't
have any special or complex features keeping it very simple to maintain
and keeping the client protocol very simple.

There is also an open-source audio driver for windows called SCREAM
that was initially designed for broadcasting audio over a network,
however, it's authors have also implemented transport via shared RAM.
While vhost-user would make much more sense here as vring buffers
would be very useful, the barrier to entry is too high and as such the
developers have instead opted to use the simple IVSHMEM device instead.

That said, I will still have a deeper look into vhost-user but I hope
the above shows the merits of this simple method of guest ram access.
