Add one more to the pile! Chrome OS noticed this when upgrading to
5.0.0:

https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1114204#c8

I'd love to see this applied to a release.

I actually wrote basically this exact same patch and was about to submit
it, when I saw that this was already here. I've tested Joe's variant:

Tested-by: Brian Norris <briannorris@chromium.org>
Reviewed-by: Brian Norris <briannorris@chromium.org>

The Chromium bug report is public, so you can see details there, but
it's basically the same -- we sometimes run qemu from a path that's not
the same absolute path noted in ./configure. This is because we build
qemu to run within our SDK (a semi-containerized chroot), but we also
support running that same QEMU binary from outside the container, which
then may be at some arbitrary hierarchy on a developer's machine.

It might be wise to include a tiny bit more verbose of a code comment,
to prevent oversights like this in the future. I'm sure that could be
spliced in when the patch is applied though.

Regards,
Brian
