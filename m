Good.

I think there are two separate issues: doc comment syntax and internal
representation.

Our internal representation reflects the input's flat structure: one
comment block after the other.  I wish it reflected the document's tree
structure instead, but I can't justify the effort to rework it.

What to put into syntax and what to leave to style is often debatable.
Putting headings into their own block makes them stand out even more,
which may be useful.  Baking that into the syntax feels a bit oppressive
to me.  Sometimes a bit of oppression can buy enough consistency to be
worth it.

Thanks!
