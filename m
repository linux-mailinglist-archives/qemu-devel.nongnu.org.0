Sounds much better, but why sys.version().split() instead of
sys.version_info?

  python_version=$($python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version_info[0])')

We have only one place where $(PYTHON_VERSION) is used, and that
code will be removed once we stop supporting Python 2.  I don't
see the point of trying to store extra information that is not
used anywhere in our makefiles.
