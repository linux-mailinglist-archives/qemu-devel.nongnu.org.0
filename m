Consider the user creates an image with "-F raw". We can validate the backi=
ng
image is raw, and so our check succeeds.  Later the malicious <something> c=
an
write a qcow header into this raw file and QEMU will thereafter probe the
image as qcow, not raw.

IOW, in the case of "-F raw", even if we immediately check the format, we'r=
e
still not offering the protection promised by the "-F" flag, because that
promise refers to the runtime behaviour of the QEMU emulator, not the
immediate qemu-img cmd.

We could support "-F ..." and validate any non-raw formats, while raising a
runtime error in the case of "-F raw", as only the "raw" backing format has
the probing security risk.

Users who need  to use qcow, with a backing file, without a format can
just not pass "-F" and in doing so will be insecure.

We could take this opportunity to deprecate 'qcow' perhaps, declare it
a read-only format, restricted to qemu-img/qemu-io for purpose of data
liberation ?

For sheepdog, if it is something we genuinely still care about, then
adding a backing file format record seems neccessary, unless we either
forbid use of raw backing files, or forbid use of non-raw backing files,
either way would be safe.
