Hi,

Looking at QEMU source code, I am puzzled regarding how migration =
backwards compatibility is preserved regarding X86CPU.

As I understand it, fields that are based on KVM capabilities and guest =
runtime usage are defined in VMState subsections in order to not send =
them if not necessary.
This is done such that in case they are not needed and we migrate to an =
old QEMU which don=E2=80=99t support loading this state, migration will =
still succeed
(As .needed() method will return false and therefore this state won=E2=80=99=
t be sent as part of migration stream).
Furthermore, in case .needed() returns true and old QEMU don=E2=80=99t =
support loading this state, migration fails. As it should because we are =
aware that guest state
is not going to be restored properly on destination.

I=E2=80=99m puzzled about what will happen in the following scenario:
1) Source is running new QEMU with new KVM that supports save of some =
VMState subsection.
2) Destination is running new QEMU that supports load this state but =
with old kernel that doesn=E2=80=99t know how to load this state.

I would have expected in this case that if source .needed() returns =
true, then migration will fail because of lack of support in destination =
kernel.
However, it seems from current QEMU code that this will actually succeed =
in many cases.

For example, if msr_smi_count is sent as part of migration stream (See =
vmstate_msr_smi_count) and destination have has_msr_smi_count=3D=3Dfalse,
then destination will succeed loading migration stream but =
kvm_put_msrs() will actually ignore env->msr_smi_count and will =
successfully load guest state.
Therefore, migration will succeed even though it should have failed=E2=80=A6=


It seems to me that QEMU should have for every such VMState subsection, =
a .post_load() method that verifies that relevant capability is =
supported by kernel
and otherwise fail migration.

What do you think? Should I really create a patch to modify all these =
CPUX86 VMState subsections to behave like this?

Thanks,
-Liran=
