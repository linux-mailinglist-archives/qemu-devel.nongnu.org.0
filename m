What backend is this? O_DIRECT with byte alignment sounds wrong, so I
wonder if your storage really can do this or whether we just failed to
detect the actual alignment.

I guess we could change the default to pick the largest size so that the
image size is still a multiple of it. But if the image size isn't even
aligned to 512 bytes, I think refusing to open the image with O_DIRECT
feels more correct (I would be okay with doing the same with > 512 byte
images, too, if the image size isn't a multiple of the alignment).
