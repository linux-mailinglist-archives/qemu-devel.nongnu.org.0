Not reliably I think.

In the "always" mode, there is none.

In the "guess"/"estimate" mode, the kernel takes a guess (currently 
implemented as checking if the mmap size <= total RAM + total SWAP).
	Committable = MemTotal + SwapTotal

In the "never" mode:
	Committable = CommitLimit - Committed_AS
However, the value gets further reduced for !root applications by 
/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes.

Replicating these calculations in user space would be suboptimal IMHO.
