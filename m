Where is the vendor and device ID virtualization done for these
devices, we can't have a PF with IDs 0000:0000.

Probably each instance of is_virtfn in vfio-pci should be looked at to
see if it applies to s390.  If we're going to recognize this as a VF,
I'd rather we complete the emulation that the lower level hypervisor
has missed.  If we can enable all the is_virtfn code on s390, then we
should probably cache is_virtfn on the vfio_pci_device object and allow
s390 a place to set it once at probe or enable time.

It sure seems preferable to recognize that it is a VF in the kernel
than to require userspace to have arch specific hacks.  Thanks,

Alex
