| If we assume that a non-negligible number of fuzz bugs will be exploitable

| human triage step to catch possibly serious security issues.

* Maybe the proposed 'qemu-security' list can receive such issue reports.  It 
  is more close than qemu-devel.

  But it also depends on the quantum of traffic oss-fuzz generates. We don't 
  want to flood/overwhelm qemu-security list or any other list for that 
  matter.

* Human triage is required to know potential impact of an issue before it is 
  sent to a public list. It would not be good to send guest-to-host-escape
  type issues directly to a public list.

* Ideally preliminary human triage should be done on the fuzzers' side.  
  After it hits an issue, someone should have a look at it before sending an 
  email to a list OR maintainer(s).

  Ex. TCG issues are generally not considered for CVE. They need not go to a
  security list.



Thank you.
