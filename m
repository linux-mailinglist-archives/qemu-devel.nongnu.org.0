You need to look earlier in the sequence (see the tag pull-tcg-20200228):

  47a2def4533a2807e48954abd50b32ecb1aaf29a

so when the argument ordering broke the guest ram_size heuristic we
started getting reports of performance regressions because we fell back
to that size. Before then it was always based on guest ram size within
the min/max bounds set by those defines.
