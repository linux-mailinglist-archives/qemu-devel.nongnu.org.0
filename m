What would be the benefit of embedding it in QEMU ? I see significant
security downside to that which would mean its not something I'd want
to support.

If we accept the need for a bus then this implies there's a need for
service <-> service messages, where neither service is QEMU. This in
turn requires enforcement of security policies for the separation of
services. It is highly desirable, if not mandatory, to have such
security enforcement outside the QEMU address space, given that QEMU
is an untrustworthy component.

From my POV I only see two viable options. Either p2p with no bus & QEMU
being one endpoint so there's no requirement for security policies, or
bus based mesh with an external process to enforce security policy.
