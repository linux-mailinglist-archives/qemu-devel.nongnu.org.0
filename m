Public bug reported:

Hi folks.

I use linux with dpdk drivers on the target system, and e1000 emulation dev=
ice with tap interface for host. I use kvm for accelerate.
Version qemu 4.0.94 and master (Nov 12 10:14:33 2019)
Version dpdk stable-17.11.4
Version linux host 4.15.0-66-generic (ubuntu 18.04)

I type command "ping <target ip> -f" and wait about 1-2 minutes. Network
subsystem freezes.

For receive the eth pack from host system (tap interface) to host system
the e1000 using ring buffer.

The e1000 write body of eth pack, set E1000_RXD_STAT_DD flag and move RDH (=
Ring Device Head).
(file hw/net/e1000.c function e1000_receive_iov() )

The dpdk driver is reading from E1000_RXD_STAT_DD flags (ignoring RDH), if =
flag is set: read buffer, unset flag E1000_RXD_STAT_DD and move RDT (Ring D=
evice Tail).
(source drivers/net/e1000/em_rxtx.c function eth_em_recv_scattered_pkts() )

I see what the driver unet E1000_RXD_STAT_DD (rxdp->status =3D 0; ), but
sometimes rxdp->status remains equal to 7. On the next cycle, this this
buffer is read, RDT moved to far. RDH becomes equal RDT and network is
freezes.

If I insert some delay after unset E1000_RXD_STAT_DD, and repeatedly unset =
E1000_RXD_STAT_DD (if rxdp->status =3D=3D 7 ), then all work fine.
If check E1000_RXD_STAT_DD without delay, status rxdp->status always valid.

This only appears on kvm. If I use tcg all works fine.

I trying set watchpoint for memory on the qemu (for tcg), and see, that
for one package cycle of set/unse STAT_DD repeated once.

I trying set watchpoint for memory on the qemu (for kvm), and see, that
rxdp->status changed to 0(unset) only once, but is changes immediately
before set flag.


Please help me with advice on how to catch and fix this error. =

Theoretically, it would help me to trace the memory access when writing to =
E1000_RXD_STAT_DD, RHD and RDT, both from the target and the host system. B=
ut I have no idea how this can be done.
