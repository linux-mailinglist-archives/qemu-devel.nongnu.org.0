Sorry for the late reply, response inline. Also I noticed a couple
mails ago I seemed to have removed the devel list and maintainers.
I've re-added them to the CC line.

Yes exactly.

Ah. This is interesting. Effectively the inverse of this patch. I had
not considered this approach. Thinking more about it, a "no shared
memory" approach does seem more straightforward implementation wise.
Unfortunately I think there would be a few substantial drawbacks:

1. Memory overhead. Every guest thread would need a full copy of QEMU
memory, including the translated guest binary.
2. Performance overhead. To keep virtual memory maps consistent across
tasks, a heavyweight 2 phase commit scheme, or similar, would be
needed for every `mmap`. That could have substantial performance
overhead for the guest. This could be a huge problem for processes
that use a large number of threads *and* do a lot of memory mapping or
frequently change page permissions.
3. There would be lots of similarly-fiddly bits that need to be shared
and coordinated in addition to guest memory. At least the signal
handler tables and fd_trans tables, but there are likely others I'm
missing.

The performance drawbacks could be largely mitigated by using the
current thread-only `CLONE_VM` support, but having *any* threads in
the process at all would lead to deadlocks after fork() or similar
non-CLONE_VM clone() calls. This could be worked around with a "stop
the world" button somewhat like `start_exclusive`, but expanded to
include all emulator threads. That will substantially slow down
fork().

Given all this I think the approach used in this series is probably at
least as "good" as a "no shared memory" approach. It has its own
complexities and drawbacks, but doesn't have obvious performance
issues. If you or other maintainers disagree, I'd be happy to write up
an RFC comparing the approaches in more detail (or we can just use
this thread), just let me know. Until then I'll keep pursuing this
patch.
