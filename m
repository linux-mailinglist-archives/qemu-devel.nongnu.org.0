I do mind in a way (git doesn't really cope well with changing things in
the first patches of this series while the later patches move them to
different files - renaming mon_cmds resulted in a big mess and now I'm
kind of fed up with this kind of merge conflicts), but I'll do it
anyway. As long as it's only one line, it shouldn't be that hard to make
sure that it still exists at the end of the series...

Hm, yes, all callers already initialise the memory now, so that can be
done.
