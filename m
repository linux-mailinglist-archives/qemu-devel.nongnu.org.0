Another issue is lifetime. We really want to have the statistics
available before we generate the code (so we can pass a direct pointer
to the helper) and we can't wait until after we qht_insert the TB into
the buffer (as any thread can start executing that buffer from that
point). So we need to ensure tb->tb_stats is live and ready as
translation time.
