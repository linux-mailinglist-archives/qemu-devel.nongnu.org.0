I don't think we need to dictate that firmware used with QEMU has to be
open source.

If someone wants to use a closed source firmware that is fine. They simply
can't expect us to help debug problems in QEMU when using the closed source
firmware, without first demonstrating it with an open source firmware we can
see.

Agreed, I can understand the motivation to not want to change the QEMU
defaults, but I don't see why we should have this as a hard coded
limit that is not runtime configurable.

IOW, why can't we keep our current default and provide a machine type
property "firmware_max_size" which users can opt-in to setting if
their particular firmware exceeds normal defaults. That won't impact
us for migration compat in any way, and lets users have flexibility t
do what they want.

Daniel
