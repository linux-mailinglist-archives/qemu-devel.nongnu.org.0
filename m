As reported on Launchpad, Azure apparently doesn't accept images for
upload that are not both aligned to 1 MB blocks and have a BAT size that
matches the image size exactly.

As far as I can tell, there is no real reason why we create a BAT that
is one entry longer than necessary for aligned image sizes, so change
that.

(Even though the condition is only mentioned as "should" in the spec and
previous products accepted larger BATs - but we'll try to maintain
compatibility with as many of Microsoft's ever-changing interpretations
of the VHD spec as possible.)
