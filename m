I'm not sure what "adding new CPUID flags" means exactly, but on
both cases, the answer is yes:

If you mean having new flags appear with the same QEMU command
line, this is 100% OK with "-cpu host".  Doubly so with
"migratable=3Doff".  "-cpu host" doesn't guarantee a stable guest
ABI, and migratable=3Doff doesn't guarantee the ability to live
migrate.

If you just mean the ability to write "-cpu
host,migratable=3Doff,+some-extra-flag", that's OK too.

I would try to make "-cpu host,migratable=3Doff" enable all
features out of the box (because users probably expect that).
But we you have a compelling reason to not enable the hyperv
flags by default (do we?), it's OK to require something like
"-cpu host,...,+hyperv".
