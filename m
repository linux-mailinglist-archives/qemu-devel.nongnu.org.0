(1) typo: s/QVMF/OVMF/ please

(2) Please replace "Secure Boot" with "SMM". In everyday practice it's
OK to use them interchangeably, but in this commit message I'd like us
to be more precise.

Wow, this is a relief. I thought it would be a difficult problem to
access the ICH9-LPC object cleanly, on the call stack of the device_add
command. I didn't imagine it would be at our disposal immediately.

(4) Please let's call this

  cpu hotplug *with* SMI

not just

  cpu hotplug SMI

(Emphasis added on "with" just for the sake of this discussion; no need
to embed the asterisks in the message.)

Because:

In my thinking, the feature that the firmware negotiates is not:

  SMI or no SMI, on CPU hotplug

Instead, the firmware negotiates:

  CPU hotplug with SMI, or no CPU hotplug

IOW, "SMI-or-no-SMI" is not a sub-feature of CPU hotplug; the feature
being negotiated, when SMI broadcast is enabled, is CPU hotplug as a
whole. That's exactly what this patch implements.

(5) Please replace

  "in Secure Boot mode"

with

  "with SMM"

(for "firmware that suppors CPU hotplug with SMM")

(6) This looks sane to me, but I have a question for the *pre-patch*
code.

I notice that hotplug_handler_pre_plug() is already called from the
(completely unrelated) function pc_memory_pre_plug().

In pc_memory_pre_plug(), we have the following snippet:

    /*
     * When -no-acpi is used with Q35 machine type, no ACPI is built,
     * but pcms->acpi_dev is still created. Check !acpi_enabled in
     * addition to cover this case.
     */
    if (!pcms->acpi_dev || !x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled(X86_MACHINE(pcms))) {
        error_setg(errp,
                   "memory hotplug is not enabled: missing acpi device or acpi disabled");
        return;
    }

Whereas in pc_cpu_pre_plug(), the present patch only adds a
"pcms->acpi_dev" nullity check.

Should pc_cpu_pre_plug() check for ACPI enablement similarly to
pc_memory_pre_plug()?

I'm asking for two reasons:

(6a) for the feature at hand (CPU hotplug with SMI), maybe we should
write:

    if (pcms->acpi_dev && x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled(X86_MACHINE(pcms))) {

(6b) or maybe more strictly, copy the check from memory hotplug (just
update the error message):

    if (!pcms->acpi_dev || !x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled(X86_MACHINE(pcms))) {
        error_setg(errp,
                   "CPU hotplug is not enabled: missing acpi device or acpi disabled");
        return;
    }

Because CPU hotplug depends on ACPI too, just like memory hotplug,
regardless of firmware, and regardless of guest-SMM. Am I correct to
think that?

Basically, I'm asking if we should replicate original commit
8cd91acec8df ("pc: fail memory hot-plug/unplug with -no-acpi and Q35
machine type", 2018-01-12) for CPU hotplug first (in a separate patch!),
before dealing with "lpc->smi_negotiated_features" in this patch.

Hmm... I'm getting confused. I *do* see similar checks in pc_cpu_plug()
and pc_cpu_unplug_request_cb(). But:

- I don't understand what determines whether we put the ACPI check in
*PRE* plug functions, or the plug functions,

- and I don't understand why pc_cpu_plug() and
pc_cpu_unplug_request_cb() only check "pcms->acpi_dev", and not
x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled().


(7) According to my request under patch#1, I propose that we should
implement a similar rejection for CPU hot-unplug, in this series. (Can
be a separate patch, of course.)

Thanks!
Laszlo
