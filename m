According to what you wrote it does not crash but also does not do
updates. That will work well only if the time difference isn't large.
Then with time as guest gets interrupted by host, the time difference
shrinks and eventually you are resyncing again.  And I'm guessing there
are hypervisor management interfaces in place to make sure that is so.
Linux is not guaranteed to have such interfaces so you have to come
up with QEMU specific ones.

Host time is a vague enough terminology. I suspect this implementation
is too simplistic to cover all cases.
