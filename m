Hmm, good point.  Should we give qio_channel_tls_shutdown a bool=20
parameter that says whether it should wait (good for use when we are=20
being run in a coroutine and can deal with the additional I/O) or just=20
fail with -EAGAIN (which the caller can ignore if it is not worried)?

We _are_ using gnutls_bye(GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR) on the close() path (which=20
is indeed a cleanup path where not blocking is worthwhile) even without=20
this patch, but the question is whether using gnutls_bye(GNUTLS_SHUT_WR)=20
in the normal data path, where we are already using coroutines to manage=20
callbacks, can benefit the remote endpoint, giving them a chance to see=20
clean shutdown instead of abrupt termination.
