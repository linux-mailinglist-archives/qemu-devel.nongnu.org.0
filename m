Tha's really a long time...

One of the reasons that I didn't check it earlier is that we don't=20
really use PCI SHPC in our production version, for Linux ITS driver can=20
only allocate a fixed range of MSI interrupts for a PCI-bridge during=20
initialization, so a later plugged-in PCI device may not be able to get=20
enough MSI interrupts and then fall back to legacy INTx. However, I=20
think it is still better to let guest OS make the decision.
