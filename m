I'm not sure that it is safe enough: we may not have opened backing at the =
moment, but
still it may exist and managed by user.

PREALLOC_MODE_OFF is documented as
# @off: no preallocation

- not very descriptive, but I think it's nothing about making backing file =
available
through new clusters.

I think PREALLOC_MODE_OFF should always make new clusters "BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOC=
ATED". If
for some scenarios (are they exist at all?) we need to preallocate cluster =
in manner
that backing file would be visible through them, we'd better add another pr=
eallocation
mode which will directly document this behaviour, like PREALLOC_MODE_BACKIN=
G.

So, I'd consider PREALLOC_MODE_OFF as something that must not create UNALLO=
CATED (in POV
of backing chains) clusters, and should be fixed in all formats.. Or as a q=
uick fix may
we may write zeros from bdrv_co_truncate, but independently of backing file=
 existence
and length.

=3D=3D=3D

Also I think it's a wrong thing at all that qcow2 new file is transparent b=
y default..
It should be transparent only when we create snapshots and incremental back=
ups. But when
we create new disk for new vm it should be zeroed (and extending L1 table e=
ntry spec by
"zero bit" may help)
