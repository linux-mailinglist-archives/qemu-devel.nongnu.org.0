:) I am not persist on this patch, but I think you have provide me an impor=
tant
clue. "Most HW vendors number pxm and node in the same way, and so does QEM=
U",=20
so i think it's reasonable for linux kernel to do the same.

So i think we can end the discussion and just ignore this patch.
Thanks very much.
