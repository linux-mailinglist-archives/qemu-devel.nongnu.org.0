You may consider it an "error" but it isn't in the "Exception" sense as we were discussing before.

The Error API seems to be mapping to the "Exception" concept, and in that sense module not found is not an Exception at all.

Your intuition comes I think from a historical look at the QEMU codebase,
but nowadays as QEMU gets more and more modularized, and packaged differently depending
on distributions, products, and user choices,

the "not found" is genuinely not in general an error case at all.
