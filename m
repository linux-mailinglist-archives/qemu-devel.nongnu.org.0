Okay, if that's so it's fair enough in this case.

I'm just very firmly against baking in the assumption that
node names mean the same thing accross migration, because that will
create a precedent situation and more stuff may be baked in on top of
this in the future. It seems that it has already happened though and
it's wrong. And the worst part is that it's never mentioned that this
might occur. But again, don't do that and preferrably remove the
matching of node names for bitmaps altogether until we can control it
arbitrarily.

We've also seen this already before with the backend name of memory
devices being baked in to the migration stream which creates an unwanted
dependancy.
