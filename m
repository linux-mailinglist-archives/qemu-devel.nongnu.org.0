You're right that we may need some more infrastructure before being able=20
to decide when to report this bit in all cases.  But for raw files, that=20
infrastructure already exists: does block_status at offset 0 and the=20
entire image as length return status that the entire file is a hole.=20
And for qcow2 files, it would not be that hard to teach a similar=20
block_status request to report the entire image as a hole based on my=20
proposed qcow2 autoclear bit tracking that the image still reads as zero.

We don't necessarily need a separate is_zero infrastructure if we can=20
instead teach the existing block_status infrastructure to report that=20
the entire image reads as zero.  You're right that clients that need to=20
force an entire image to be zero won't need to directly call=20
block_status (they can just call bdrv_make_zero, and let that worry=20
about whether a block status call makes sense among its list of steps to=20
try).  But since block_status can report all-zero status for some cases,=20
it's not hard to use that for feeding the NBD bit.

However, there's a difference between qemu's block status (which is=20
already typed correctly to return a 64-bit answer, even if it may need a=20
few tweaks for clients that currently don't expect it to request more=20
than 32 bits) and NBD's block status (which can only report 32 bits=20
barring a new extension to the protocol), and where a single all-zero=20
bit at NBD_OPT_GO is just as easy of an extension as a way to report a=20
64-bit all-zero response to NBD_CMD_BLOCK_STATUS.

Adding 64-bit commands to NBD is more invasive than adding a single=20
startup status bit.  Both ideas can be done - doing one does not=20
preclude the other.  But at the same time, not all servers will=20
implement both ideas - if one is easy to implement while the other is=20
hard, it is not unlikely that qemu will still encounter NBD servers that=20
advertise startup state but not support 64-bit make_zero (even if qemu=20
as NBD server starts supporting 64-bit make zero) or even 64-bit block=20
status results.

Another thing to think about here is timing.  With the proposed NBD=20
addition, it is the server telling the client that "the image you are=20
connecting to started zero", prior to the point that the client even has=20
a chance to request "can you make the image all zero in a quick manner=20
(and if not, I'll fall back to writing zeroes as I go)".  And even if=20
NBD gains a 64-bit block status and/or make zero command, it is still=20
less network traffic for the server to advertise up-front that the image=20
is all zero than it is for the client to have to issue command requests=20
of the server (network traffic is not always the bottleneck, but it can=20
be a consideration).

Just because we don't think that qemu-img has such a case does not mean=20
that other NBD clients will not be able to come up with some use for=20
knowing if an image starts all zero.

The problem is WHERE do you implement it.  Is it more efficient to=20
implement make_zero in the NBD server (the client merely requests to=20
make zero, but lets the server do all the work) or in the NBD client=20
(the client learns whether the server is already zero, and not hearing=20
yes, the client proceeds to do all the work to write zeroes).  From the=20
qemu perspective, qemu-img convert needs the image to be zero, and=20
bdrv_make_zero will report back either "yes I quickly made it zero,=20
possibly by doing nothing" or "no, making it zero now is no more=20
efficient than you just writing zeroes as you go".  But although the=20
code in qemu-img is the same whether bdrv_make_zero is able to request=20
the work be done in the server or whether the work has to be done in the=20
client, the code in the block layer that implements bdrv_make_zero may=20
itself care about knowing whether the NBD server started all zero.
