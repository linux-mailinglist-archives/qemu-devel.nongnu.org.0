Hi Peter,

Happy New Year too!

As an status update, I have some work queued up related to this work
that I need to do some minor polishing and then post to the mailing
list.  That has to do with the changes to container definition files,
and the most basic changes to the GitLab YAML configuration files to
achieve a first stage of implementation.

We'd also have to coordinate access to the existing machines in use,
so that we can validate that this proposal will work.  Just to be
extra clear, I'm available to this initial configuration on the
machines that are currently running the tests, provided you think it's
a good idea.  Also, that would also be helpful to me, as I'm learning
a lot of this stuff as I go, and there's always some tricky new
details on different environments.

PS: I'm actually on the road, but I should be settle by Tomorrow, and
I expect to resume work on this the following day.

Best Regards,
- Cleber.
