> +---------------------
> +
> +QEMU supports many different use cases, some of which have stricter secu=
rity
> +requirements than others.  The community has agreed on the overall secur=
ity
> +requirements that users may depend on.  These requirements define what is
> +considered supported from a security perspective.

> +Virtualization Use Case
> +'''''''''''''''''''''''
> +
> +The virtualization use case covers cloud and virtual private server (VPS)
> +hosting, as well as traditional data center and desktop virtualization. =
 These
> +use cases rely on hardware virtualization extensions to execute guest co=
de
> +safely on the physical CPU at close-to-native speed.
> +
> +The following entities are untrusted, meaning that they may be buggy or
> +malicious:
> +
> +- Guest
> +- User-facing interfaces (e.g. VNC, SPICE, WebSocket)
> +- Network protocols (e.g. NBD, live migration)
> +- User-supplied files (e.g. disk images, kernels, device trees)
> +- Passthrough devices (e.g. PCI, USB)
> +
> +Bugs affecting these entities are evaluated on whether they can cause da=
mage in
> +real-world use cases and treated as security bugs if this is the case.
> +
> +Non-virtualization Use Case
> +'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
> +
> +The non-virtualization use case covers emulation using the Tiny Code Gen=
erator
> +(TCG).  In principle the TCG and device emulation code used in conjuncti=
on with
> +the non-virtualization use case should meet the same security requiremen=
ts as
> +the virtualization use case.  However, for historical reasons much of the
> +non-virtualization use case code was not written with these security
> +requirements in mind.
> +
> +Bugs affecting the non-virtualization use case are not considered securi=
ty

y on

> +
> +Guest Isolation
> +'''''''''''''''
> +
> +Guest isolation is the confinement of guest code to the virtual machine.=
  When
> +guest code gains control of execution on the host this is called escapin=
g the
> +virtual machine.  Isolation also includes resource limits such as thrott=
ling of
> +CPU, memory, disk, or network.  Guests must be unable to exceed their re=
source
> +limits.
> +
> +QEMU presents an attack surface to the guest in the form of emulated dev=
ices.
> +The guest must not be able to gain control of QEMU.  Bugs in emulated de=
vices
> +could allow malicious guests to gain code execution in QEMU.  At this po=
int the
> +guest has escaped the virtual machine and is able to act in the context =
of the
> +QEMU process on the host.
> +
> +Guests often interact with other guests and share resources with them.  A
> +malicious guest must not gain control of other guests or access their da=
ta.
> +Disk image files and network traffic must be protected from other guests=
 unless
> +explicitly shared between them by the user.
> +
> +Principle of Least Privilege
> +''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
> +
> +The principle of least privilege states that each component only has acc=
ess to
> +the privileges necessary for its function.  In the case of QEMU this mea=
ns that
> +each process only has access to resources belonging to the guest.
> +
> +The QEMU process should not have access to any resources that are inacce=
ssible
> +to the guest.  This way the guest does not gain anything by escaping int=
o the
> +QEMU process since it already has access to those same resources from wi=
thin
> +the guest.
> +
> +Following the principle of least privilege immediately fulfills guest is=
olation
> +requirements.  For example, guest A only has access to its own disk imag=
e file
> +``a.img`` and not guest B's disk image file ``b.img``.
> +
> +In reality certain resources are inaccessible to the guest but must be
> +available to QEMU to perform its function.  For example, host system cal=
ls are
> +necessary for QEMU but are not exposed to guests.  A guest that escapes =
into
> +the QEMU process can then begin invoking host system calls.
> +
> +New features must be designed to follow the principle of least privilege.
> +Should this not be possible for technical reasons, the security risk mus=
t be
> +clearly documented so users are aware of the trade-off of enabling the f=
eature.
> +
> +Isolation mechanisms
> +''''''''''''''''''''
> +
> +Several isolation mechanisms are available to realize this architecture =
of
> +guest isolation and the principle of least privilege.  With the exceptio=
n of
> +Linux seccomp, these mechanisms are all deployed by management tools that
> +launch QEMU, such as libvirt.  They are also platform-specific so they a=
re only
> +described briefly for Linux here.
> +
> +The fundamental isolation mechanism is that QEMU processes must run as
> +unprivileged users.  Sometimes it seems more convenient to launch QEMU as
> +root to give it access to host devices (e.g. ``/dev/net/tun``) but this =
poses a
> +huge security risk.  File descriptor passing can be used to give an othe=
rwise
> +unprivileged QEMU process access to host devices without running QEMU as=
 root.
> +It is also possible to launch QEMU as a non-root user and configure UNIX=
 groups
> +for access to ``/dev/kvm``, ``/dev/net/tun``, and other device nodes.
> +Some Linux distros already ship with UNIX groups for these devices by de=
fault.
> +
> +- SELinux and AppArmor make it possible to confine processes beyond the
> +  traditional UNIX process and file permissions model.  They restrict th=
e QEMU
> +  process from accessing processes and files on the host system that are=
 not
> +  needed by QEMU.
> +
> +- Resource limits and cgroup controllers provide throughput and utilizat=
ion
> +  limits on key resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth.
> +
> +- Linux namespaces can be used to make process, file system, and other s=
ystem
> +  resources unavailable to QEMU.  A namespaced QEMU process is restricte=
d to only
> +  those resources that were granted to it.
> +
> +- Linux seccomp is available via the QEMU ``--sandbox`` option.  It disa=
bles
> +  system calls that are not needed by QEMU, thereby reducing the host ke=
rnel
> +  attack surface.
> +
> +Sensitive configurations
> +------------------------
> +
> +There are aspects of QEMU that can have security implications which user=
s &
> +management applications must be aware of.
> +
> +Monitor console (QMP and HMP)
> +'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
> +
> +The monitor console (whether used with QMP or HMP) provides an interface
> +to dynamically control many aspects of QEMU's runtime operation. Many of=
 the
> +commands exposed will instruct QEMU to access content on the host file s=
ystem
> +and/or trigger spawning of external processes.
> +
> +For example, the ``migrate`` command allows for the spawning of arbitrary
> +processes for the purpose of tunnelling the migration data stream. The
> +``blockdev-add`` command instructs QEMU to open arbitrary files, exposing
> +their content to the guest as a virtual disk.
> +
> +Unless QEMU is otherwise confined using technologies such as SELinux, Ap=
pArmor,
> +or Linux namespaces, the monitor console should be considered to have pr=
ivileges
> +equivalent to those of the user account QEMU is running under.
> +
> +It is further important to consider the security of the character device=
 backend
> +over which the monitor console is exposed. It needs to have protection a=
gainst
> +malicious third parties which might try to make unauthorized connections=
, or
> +perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Many of the character device backends=
 do not
> +satisfy this requirement and so must not be used for the monitor console.
> +
> +The general recommendation is that the monitor console should be exposed=
 over
> +a UNIX domain socket backend to the local host only. Use of the TCP based
> +character device backend is inappropriate unless configured to use both =
TLS
> +encryption and authorization control policy on client connections.
> +
> +In summary, the monitor console is considered a privileged control inter=
face to
> +QEMU and as such should only be made accessible to a trusted management
> +application or user.
