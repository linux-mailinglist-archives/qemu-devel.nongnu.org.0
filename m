So, the more I look into it the more I doubt this should go into the 
MemoryListener.

The RamDiscardManager is specific to RAM memory regions - similarly the 
IOMMU notifier is specific to IOMMU regions.

In the near future we will have two "clients" (vfio, 
tpm/dump-guest-memory), whereby only vfio will actually has to register 
for updates at runtime.

I really want to have a dedicated registration/notifier mechanism, for 
reasons already mentioned in my last mail, but also to later reuse that 
mechanism in other context as noted in the cover letter:

"Note: At some point, we might want to let RAMBlock users (esp. vfio 
used for nvme://) consume this interface as well. We'll need RAMBlock 
notifier calls when a RAMBlock is getting mapped/unmapped (via the 
corresponding memory region), so we can properly register a listener 
there as well."


However, I do agree that the notifier should work with 
MemoryRegionSection - this will make the "client" code much easier.

The register()/replay_populate() mechanism should consume a 
MemoryRegionSection to work on, and call the listener via (adjusted) 
MemoryRegionSection.

Maybe I'm even able to simplify/get rid of the discard_all() callback.
