Reviving this old thread, because I'd like to connect it to more recent

"Grepability" alone would make that worthwhile, I think.

This is the difficult part.  See my "Exposing feature deprecation to
machine clients (was: [Qemu-devel] [PATCH 2/2] qapi: deprecate implicit
filters)" in this thread.  Quote:

    Propagating errors is painful.  It has caused massive churn all over th=
e
    place.

    I don't think we can hitch deprecation info to the existing error
    propagation, since we need to take the success path back to the QMP
    core, not an error path.

    Propagating a second object for warnings... thanks, but no thanks.

    The QMP core could provide a function for recording deprecation info fo=
r
    the currently executing QMP command.  This is how we used to record
    errors in QMP commands, until Anthony rammed through what we have now.
    The commit messages (e.g. d5ec4f27c38) provide no justification.  I
    dimly recall adamant (oral?) claims that recording errors in the Monito=
r
    object cannot work for us.

    I smell a swamp.

    Can we avoid plumbing deprecation info from command code to QMP core?
    Only if the QMP core itself can recognize deprecated interfaces.  I
    believe it can for the cases we can expose in introspecion.  Let me
    explain.

    Kevin recently added "features" to the QAPI schema language.  The
    implementation is incomplete, but that's detail.  The idea is to tack a
    "deprecated" feature to deprecated stuff in the QAPI schema.

    Commands and arguments need to support features for that.
    Implementation should be relatively straightforward.

    Deprecating an argument's optionalness may require a
    "optional-deprecated" feature.  I've seen more elegant designs, but I'v=
e
    also seen plenty of uglier ones.

    Note that features are tied to schema syntax.  To express semantically
    conditional deprecation like "if you specify argument FOO, then not
    specifying argument BAR is deprecated", we'd have to add a language for
    these conditions.  Uh, not now, maybe never.

    The primary use of having deprecation defined in the QAPI schema is
    introspection.  The BoF minutes mention this, too.

    A secondary use could be detecting use of deprecated features right in
    the QMP core.  No need for ad hoc code in commands, no need for plumbin=
g
    information from there to the QMP core.

    I'd like to pursue this idea, then see how well it suits our deprecatio=
n
    needs.

I've since explored this idea in

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg06604.html

Quoting Dan's conclusion:

    In summary, it is probably reasonable to include this info in the QMP
    command reply, but don't expect much to be done with it beyond possibly
    writing it to a log file.
