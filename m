It is not obvious what 'ignore' actually means for block jobs: It could
be continuing the job and returning success in the end despite the error
(no block job does this). It could also mean continuing and returning
failure in the end (this is what stream does). And it can mean retrying
the failed request later (this is what backup, commit and mirror do).

This (somewhat inconsistent) behaviour was introduced and described for
stream and mirror in commit ae586d6158. backup and commit were
introduced later and use the same model as mirror.
