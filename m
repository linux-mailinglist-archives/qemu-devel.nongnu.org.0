AFAIKS the only real benefit of versioned CPU models is that you can add=20
new CPU model versions without new QEMU version.

Then you can specify "-cpu z13-vX" or "-cpu z13 -cpuv X" (no idea how=20
versioned CPU model were implemented) on any QEMU machine. Which is the=20
same as telling your customer "please use z13,featX=3Don" in case you have=
=20
a good reason to not use the host model (along with baselining) but use=20
an explicit model.

If you can change the default model of QEMU machines, you can automate=20
this process. I am pretty sure this is a corner case, though (e.g.,=20
IBRS). Usually you have a new QEMU machine and can simply enable the new=20
feature from that point on.
