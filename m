The disadvantage of this is that you won't clear in the kernel those
dirty bits that come from other sources (e.g. vhost or
address_space_map).  This can lead to double-copying of pages.

Migration already makes a local copy in rb->bmap, and
memory_region_snapshot_and_clear_dirty can also do the clear.  Would it
be possible to invoke the clear using rb->bmap instead of the KVMSlot's
new bitmap?

Thanks,

Paolo
