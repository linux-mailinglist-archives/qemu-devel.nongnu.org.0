There is no such standard for powerpc today that I know of.

Keith and I are somewhat of a different mind here. From the perspective
of the user of that API (picolibc is one), it's easier to deal with a
single one and have everybody inherit the same bugs.

Now I understand the point of wanting to fix the mistakes made but I
would suggest we do so by proposing extensions to the existing one to
do so.

AFAIK they are still just doing what ARM does for the above reason.

Cheers,
