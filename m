In which way do you think this could change? It's a pretty fundamental
fact about non-coroutine code that it can't yield.

What could change, of course, is that some code switches from being
synchronous to using a coroutine. The assertion would automatically
apply then and catch the bug if adding proper locking is forgotten.
