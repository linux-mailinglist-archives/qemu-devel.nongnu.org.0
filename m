I think the original idea was that in BlockDriver, special interfaces
like the ones used by qemu-img rebase could eventually go away if we
have a single consistent interface to change image options, which is
amend. So ideally, bdrv_change_backing_file() should become a wrapper
around amend.

I'm not even sure if the behaviour you mention should be considered a
bug because amend is a low-level interface. But even if that's the case,
it would be a matter of simply adding a check.
