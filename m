Hi Igor,
My sincere Apologies, I just realized that I missed to reply this mail.
I was distracted to something else in  the month of the February and
had only resumed working on hotplug in march. But will still reply to
this mail. Also, I have incorporated most of the below points as in the
vcpu hotplug patches as per your suggestions.

I am not sure why you said "including cold-plugged one"? I hope by
cold-plug'ging you mean here are the CPUs which already exist at
the boot time of the Guest VM and plugged using -device?

                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless you have pasted wrongly here, above output also shows qom path
as 'unattached' for cold-plugged CPUs. Am I missing something? :)

Well if you were referring to below then it has been part of qemu for quite
long now:

Patch: util - add automated ID generation utility

Agreed. I have pre-sized GIC with possible vcpus. I think Marc did
mention about this earlier.

Something similar. But I am doing it from virt machine init.

Agreed with respect to KVM change. I have added some new in qemu/kvm
layer but some re-factoring might be needed later to extract common
code. Also, ARM arch specific functions had to be introduced.

Yes, I have done exactly this and perhaps this approach was discussed
in earlier mail-chains as well involving you. So taken your suggestion
and many thanks for this :)

Sure, I can see your point. I have tried to incorporate part of it.
Maybe you would like to check the code which will be sent soon.
