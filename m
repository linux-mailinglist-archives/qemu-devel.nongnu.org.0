Ah, now I see what you mean! I thought that "libssh specification" was
any of the SSH RFCs, and that's why I did not find what you meant.
I see you were talking about the libssh API documentation :-)
(Never heard the API docs of a library called as "specification" before,
TBH.)

Makes sense -- I just asked to the libssh people, and appending
"this may be a possible attack" should be enough, especially that this
is not a UI message like the one written by the ssh client.

Not a problem. I preferred to ask explicitly to make sure to get it
right -- any amount of information shown is fine for me, I want to make
sure to follow QEMU best practices (if any).
