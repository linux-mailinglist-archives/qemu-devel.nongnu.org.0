$ROOT/hmp.c and $ROOT/qmp.c contain various command implementations,
just as $ROOT/monitor/misc.c. This is still a bit of a mess. I'll have
to address this at least partially in the next step because I need to
separate commands that can be linked with tools from those that require
a system emulator.

My plan involves at least creating some monitor/qmp-cmds-*.c, which
might already make $ROOT/qmp.c empty. Even though I don't strictly need
it, there's no reason not to do the same for HMP, too. In any case, I'd
rather address this in a separate follow-up series.

But if people prefer, I can move the existing files in the root
directory to monitor/{qmp,hmp}-cmds.c temporarily in this series and
then work from there with follow-ups until they are empty (or maybe I
don't even have to make them completely empty then).
