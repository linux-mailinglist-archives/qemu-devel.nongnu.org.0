I agree with you that keeping that list updated is a daunting task. In 
my opinion, however, it is not as difficult as a seccomp filter, for the 
following reasons:

1) Seccomp covers everything that runs in your process, including shared 
libraries that you have no control over. CFI covers only the code in the 
QEMU binary. So at least we don't have to guess what other libraries 
used by QEMU will or won't do during execution.

2) With seccomp you have to filter behavior that, while admissible, 
should not happen in your code. CFI can be seen as a run-time type 
checking system; if the signature of the function is wrong, that is a 
coding error... in theory. In practice, there is a corner-case because 
the type checking doesn't know the signature of code loaded or written 
at run-time, and that is why you have to use a CFI filter.

So yes, there is risk, but IMHO it's not as high as in seccomp.

I think with a bit of education, it would be easy to spot red flags in 
new code.
As for education/testing... I can definitely work on a doc to be put in 
docs/devel.
Testing for CFI violations may be more difficult, however if a test code 
that exercises it is written in tests/, compiling QEMU with CFI and 
running the test should be sufficient to hit the violation.
I also wonder if this is something that could be put in the fuzzing 
environment. It would probably also help in finding coding error in 
corner cases quicker.

Regards,
Daniele
