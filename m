Both DSI/GI should cover maps too?  E.g. vtd_sync_shadow_page_table() in
vtd_iotlb_domain_invalidate().

I could be wrong, but I'd guess it's because vt-d implemented the caching mode
by leveraging the same invalidation strucuture, so it's harder to make all
things right (IOW, we can't clearly identify MAP with UNMAP when we receive an
invalidation request, because MAP/UNMAP requests look the same).

I didn't check others, but I believe spapr is doing it differently by using
some hypercalls to deliver IOMMU map/unmap requests, which seems a bit close to
what virtio-iommu is doing.  Anyway, the point is if we have explicit MAP/UNMAP
from the guest, logically the replay indeed does not need to do any unmap
because we don't need to call replay() on an already existing device but only
for e.g. hot plug.  VT-d does not have that clear interface, so VT-d needs to
maintain its own mapping structures, and also vt-d is using the same replay &
page_walk operations to sync all these structures, which complicated the vt-d
replay a bit.  With that, we assume replay() can be called anytime on a device,
and we won't notify duplicated MAPs to lower layer like vfio if it is mapped
before.  At the meantime, since we'll compare the latest mapping with the one
we cached in the iova tree, UNMAP becomes possible too.
