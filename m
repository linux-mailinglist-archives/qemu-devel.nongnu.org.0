Ouch I should definitely do that...  How about something like this
(in ioapic_eoi_broadcast(), I even changed kvm_resample_fd_notify to
return a boolean to show whether some GSI is kicked so for this case
we don't need to proceed on checking irr and remote irr):

            /*
             * When IOAPIC is in the userspace while APIC is still in
             * the kernel (i.e., split irqchip), we have a trick to
             * kick the resamplefd logic for registered irqfds from
             * userspace to deactivate the IRQ.  When that happens, it
             * means the irq bypassed userspace IOAPIC (so the irr and
             * remote-irr of the table entry should be bypassed too
             * even if interrupt come), then we don't need to clear
             * the remote-IRR and check irr again because they'll
             * always be zeros.
             */
            if (kvm_resample_fd_notify(n)) {
                continue;
            }

I confess this is still tricky, and actually after some careful read I
noticed you've proposed a similar kernel fix for the problem too which
I overlooked (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10738541/#22609933).
My current thought is that we keep this hackery in userspace only so
we keep split+resamplefd forbidden in the kernel and be clean there.

What's your opinion?

(I should have marked this series as RFC when post)
