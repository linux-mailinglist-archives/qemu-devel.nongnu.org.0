The code is correct (though it is admittedly not entirely obvious at
first glance). The switch statement at line 4753 is on "(opc | (invert
<< 2))" (where opc is a 2 bit field and invert a 1 bit field). Both ANDS
and BICS have opc=3D=3D3 and so will cause a call to gen_logic_CC(). The
difference between the two insns is that ANDC has invert=3D=3D0 and BICS has
invert=3D=3D1.

Title:
  aarch64 BICS instruciton doesn't set flags

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  When reading the source for translate-a64.c here:

  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/a466dd084f51cdc9da2e99361f674f98d721855=
9/target/arm/translate-a64.c#L4783

  I noticed that it does not appear to call gen_logic_CC for the BICS
  instruction so is not setting the flags as required. I haven't tried
  to produce a test case for it but it seems like it might be a bug.
