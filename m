I'm sure you are *technically* right, but you seem to be assuming that I
can modify or rearrange anything I want in edk2. :)

If we can solve the above in OVMF platform code, that's great. If not
(e.g. UefiCpuPkg code needs to be updated), then things will get tricky.
If we can introduce another platform hook for this, that would help. I
can't say before I try.

Option#1 would be similar to how TSEG works now, correct? IOW normal RAM
(from the QEMU perspective) is exposed as "SMRAM" to the guest, hidden
with a "black hole" overlay (outside of SMM) if SMRAM is closed.

If that's correct, then #1 looks more attractive to me than #2.
