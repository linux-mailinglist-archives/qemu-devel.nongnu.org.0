That's looking much better :)  And finally, how many failures do you get
running the same test under QEMU 3.1? If that gives you zero failures
then I'll need to look a lot closer at the changes to try and figure out
what is going on.

As a matter of interest, which tests are the ones that are failing?

Title:
  instruction 'denbcdq' misbehaving

Bug description:
  Instruction 'denbcdq' appears to have no effect.  Test case attached.

  I started looking at the code, but I got confused rather quickly.
  Could be related to endianness? I think denbcdq arrived on the scene
  before little-endian was a big deal.  Maybe something to do with
  utilizing implicit floating-point register pairs...  I don't think the
  right data is getting to helper_denbcdq, which would point back to the
  gen_fprp_ptr uses in dfp-impl.inc.c (GEN_DFP_T_FPR_I32_Rc).  (Maybe?)
