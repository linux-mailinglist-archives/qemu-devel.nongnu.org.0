 there is no way to corrupt data or crash later when the guest is already r=
unning again post-reboot and doing real work.

Yeah I never said it will always work. :)

However it does not mean it'll break every time.  My guess is that for
the happened cases it might still survive quite a few, confessing that
is without much clue.  I just prefer to avoid having an explicit patch
to bail out like that, because it doesn't really help that much by
crashing earlier.

That's something I learnt when I started to work on migration, that
is, we don't call exit() on source VM when we really, really needed
to.  For postcopy, it's the destination VM that matters here.

Yeh not a big deal since this is really corner case even if it
happened.  Let's follow the maintainers' judgement.

Thanks,
