Agreed

I'm more familiar with CMake rather than meson but they seem to be
similar. CMake has a way to wrap build of submodules:
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html

I haven't found if meson has the feature. Perhaps, like 4) it's
something to be enhanced in meson.

An alternative is to change the submodules to Meson (if their
maintainers don't mind the change) and use meson subproject:

https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html
