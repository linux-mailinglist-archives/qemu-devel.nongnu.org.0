This code was added to avoid sending the same mapping for each queue:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/b931bfbf042983f311b3b09894d8030b2755a638
(arguably, the filtering could have been done earlier)

But if you reconnect, it should still send it again at least once (for vq #0).

vhost-user-bridge reconnect used to work quite reliably, I haven't
tested recently.
