Hi,

This series is supposed to pull out some of the problems from my
=E2=80=9CGeneric file creation fallback=E2=80=9D series.

The blk_truncate_for_formatting() function added there was buggy, as
Maxim noted, in that it did not check whether blk_truncate() actually
resized the block node to the target offset.  One way to fix this is to
add a parameter to it that forces the block driver to do so, and that is
done by this series.

I think this is generally useful (you can see the diff stat saldo is
only +23 lines), because it allows us to drop a special check in
qemu-img resize, and it fixes a bug in qed (which has relied on this
behavior for over 8 years, but unfortunately bdrv_truncate()=E2=80=99s be=
havior
changed quite exactly 8 years ago).

However, in the process I noticed we actually don=E2=80=99t need
blk_truncate_for_formatting(): The underlying problem is that some
format drivers truncate their underlying file node to 0 before
formatting it to drop all data.  So they should pass exact=3Dtrue, but
they cannot, because this would break creation on block devices.  Hence
blk_truncate_for_formatting().

It turns out, though, that three of the four drivers in question don=E2=80=
=99t
need to truncate their file node at all.  The remaining one is qed which
simply really should pass exact=3Dtrue (it=E2=80=99s a bug fix).

(I do drop those blk_truncate() invocations in this series, because
otherwise I feel like it is impossible to decide whether they should get
exact=3Dfalse or exact=3Dtrue.  Either way is wrong.)


Max Reitz (8):
  block: Handle filter truncation like native impl.
  block/cor: Drop cor_co_truncate()
  block: Do not truncate file node when formatting
  block: Add @exact parameter to bdrv_co_truncate()
  block: Evaluate @exact in protocol drivers
  block: Let format drivers pass @exact
  block: Pass truncate exact=3Dtrue where reasonable
