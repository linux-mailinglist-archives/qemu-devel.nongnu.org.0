Hi, not sure if what is asked here is context in terms of the previous upstream discussions or our specific requirement we are trying to bring upstream.

In terms of the specific requirement we are trying to bring upstream, we need to get libvirt+QEMU VM save and restore functionality to be able to transfer VM sizes of ~30 GB (4/8 vcpus) in roughly 5 seconds.
When an event trigger happens, the VM needs to be quickly paused and saved to disk safely, including datasync, and another VM needs to be restored, also in ~5 secs.
For our specific requirement, the VM is never running when its data (mostly consisting of RAM) is saved.

I understand that the need to handle also the "live" case comes from upstream discussions about solving the "general case",
where someone might want to do this for "live" VMs, but if helpful I want to highlight that it is not part of the specific requirement we are trying to address,
and for this specific case won't also in the future, as the whole point of the trigger is to replace the running VM with another VM, so it cannot be kept running.

The reason we are using "migrate" here likely stems from the fact that existing libvirt code currently uses QMP migrate to implement the save and restore commands.
And in my personal view, I think that reusing the existing building blocks (migration, multifd) would be preferable, to avoid having to maintain two separate ways to do the same thing.

That said, it could be done in a different way, if the performance can keep up. Just thinking of reducing the overall effort and also maintenance surface.

Ciao,

Claudio
