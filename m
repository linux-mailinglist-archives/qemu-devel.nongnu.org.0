UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE are a set of user wait instructions.

UMONITOR arms address monitoring hardware using an address. A store
to an address within the specified address range triggers the
monitoring hardware to wake up the processor waiting in umwait.

UMWAIT instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state while monitoring a range of addresses. The optimized
state may be either a light-weight power/performance optimized state
(c0.1 state) or an improved power/performance optimized state
(c0.2 state).

TPAUSE instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state c0.1 or c0.2 state and wake up when time-stamp counter
reaches specified timeout.

Availability of the user wait instructions is indicated by the presence
of the CPUID feature flag WAITPKG CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[5].

The patches enable the umonitor, umwait and tpause features in KVM.
Because umwait and tpause can put a (psysical) CPU into a power saving
state, by default we dont't expose it in kvm and provide a capability to
enable it. Use kvm capability to enable UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE when
QEMU use "-overcommit cpu-pm=on, a VM can use UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE
instructions. If the instruction causes a delay, the amount of time
delayed is called here the physical delay. The physical delay is first
computed by determining the virtual delay (the time to delay relative to
the VMâ€™s timestamp counter). Otherwise, UMONITOR, UMWAIT and TPAUSE cause
an invalid-opcode exception(#UD).
