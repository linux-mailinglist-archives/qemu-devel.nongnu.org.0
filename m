I am confusing why only  inexact  are set then we can use hard-float.
And PPC always clearing inexact  flag before calling to soft-float
funcitons. so we can not
optimize it with hard-float.
I need some resouces about ineact flag and why always clearing inexcat in
PPC FP simualtion.
I am looking for two possible solution:
1. do not clear inexact flag in PPC simulation
2. even the inexact are cleared, we can still use alternative hard-float.

But now I am the beginner, Have no clue about all the things.

&gt; amd Richard&#39;s reply immediately below that. In short to optimise F=
PU<br>
&gt; emulation we would either find a way to compute inexact flag quickly <=
br>
&gt; without reading the FPU status (this may not be possible) or somehow<b=
r>
&gt; get status from the FPU but the obvious way of claring the flag and<br=

&gt; reading them after each operation is too slow. So maybe using<br>
&gt; exceptions and only clearing when actually there&#39;s a change could =
be<br>
&gt; faster.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As to how to use exceptions see this message in above thread:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; <a href=3D"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-03/msg0=

chive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-03/msg00005.html</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But that&#39;s only to show how to hook in an exception handler what i=
t<br>
&gt; does needs to be implemented. Then tested and benchmarked.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I still don&#39;t know where are the extensive PPC floating point test=
s to<br>
&gt; use for checking results though as that was never answered.<br>
<br>
Specifically for PPC we don&#39;t have them. We use the softfloat test case=
s<br>
to exercise our softfloat/hardfloat code as part of &quot;make<br>
check-softfloat&quot;. You can also re-build fp-bench for each guest target=
<br>
to measure raw throughput.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; However in short the problem is if the float_flag_inexact is clear=
 you<br>
&gt;&gt; must use softfloat so you can properly calculate the inexact statu=
s. We<br>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t take advantage of the inexact stickiness without loosing=
 the<br>
&gt;&gt; fidelity of the calculation.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I still don&#39;t get why can&#39;t we use hardware via exception hand=
ler to<br>
&gt; detect flags for us and why do we only use hardfloat in some corner<br=

&gt; cases. If reading the status is too costly then we could mirror it in<=
br>
&gt; a global which is set by an FP exception handler. Shouldn&#39;t that b=
e<br>
&gt; faster? Is there a reason that can&#39;t work?<br>
<br>
It would work but it would be slow. Almost every FP operation sets<br>
the inexact flag so it would generate an exception and exceptions take<br>
time to process.<br>
<br>
For the guests where we use hardfloat operations with inexact already<br>
latched is not a corner case - it is the common case which is why it<br>
helps.<br>
