Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  Qemu 2.8  on PPC64 issue with input

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi devs,
  on my PPC64 machine if i start qemu with gtk,gl=3Don or with sdl,gl=3Don =
i have issue with pointer and keyboard. pratically not input at all.
  This issue is present in tgc and in kvm

  without gl=3Don option in kvm with mate as guest i have the input device
  work in the beginning but after some time the usb goes "unplugged" (i
  see this message on the serial log of qemu usb unplugged) and the
  keyboard and mouse dont work.

  On Debian jessie kvm i dont have input working at all.

  my machine is a G5 quad with Fedora 25 PPC64

  thanks
  Luigi
