test_plug_with_device_add_x86() is supposed to test device_add (currently broken),
so do we really need more heavy avocado tests,
how about adding this test to tests/cpu-plug-test.c
('make check' is used much more often by developers)

Perhaps someone reads docs and uses API as designed (libvirt is not the only user)

I'd prefer to allow implicit die-id in 4.1 and 'stable' as that
ship has already sailed and make it mandatory since 4.2 as it is
supposed to be (+opening bug on libvirt - hoping that API would
be fixed properly this time).


Another related to die-id series bug:
We should hide die-id from query-hotpluggable-cpus output
for 4.0 and older machine types as well, so it won't break
migration for users that implement interface as documented
as it won't be possible to start
 old-qemu-4.0 -device cpufoo,die-id=0,...
since that "-device cpufoo,die-id=0,..." were used on new-qemu source.

PS:
Adding affected targets maintainers to the loop to see if
we can drop restriction.

Even though it works fine for die-id and I don't see immediate problems
with relaxing rule, I reluctant to do it, since instead of simple
 "add all properties you were told to"
implicit rules would evolve into mess similar to smp_parse() over time.

Also if we would need to change implicit values logic down the road
it would be a pain like with any default parameters in QEMU, which is
a good reason against relaxing rule.
