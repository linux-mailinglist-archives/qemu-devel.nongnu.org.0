I wonder if there's some undiagnosed timer or interrupt problems we're
hitting in NetBSD. We had someone just yesterdayt on IRC reporting they
needed kernel irqchip disabled for OpenBSD under some circumstances
for example. So could be worth trying one or more of the various
tweak args like:

    -machine kernel_irqchip=3Doff
    -global kvm-pit.lost_tick_policy=3Ddiscard

to see if it affects stability to any useful extent.

Daniel
