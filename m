To be clear, I don't have any opinion on whether we need to support
cross-OS/TCP or not.

I'm merely saying that if we do decide to support cross-OS/TCP, then
I think we need a more explicitly modelled protocol, instead of relying
on serialization of C structs.

There could be benefits to an explicitly modelled protocol, even for
local only usage, if we want to more easily support non-C languages
doing serialization, but again I don't have a strong opinion on whether
that's neccessary to worry about or not.

So I guess largely the question boils down to setting the scope of
what we want to be able to achieve in terms of RPC endpoints.

Daniel
