Public bug reported:

When trying to debug an armv7-m binary running on Qemu, GDB makes some
mistakes due to mistakenly believing the target is not M-profile.

One observable is that backtraces over signal handlers are not handled
correctly -- since the special M-profile EXC_RETURN value is not
recognised.  That happens because GDB doesn't think the target is
M-profile.

This happens because GDB sees a reported feature set from the Qemu
remote connection that includes the feature `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

As described in the GDB online docs, for "M-profile targets (e.g. Cortex-M3=
), the =E2=80=98org.gnu.gdb.arm.core=E2=80=99 feature is replaced by =E2=80=
=98org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile=E2=80=99"
https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/ARM-Features.html

>From a scan of the Qemu source code on commit
ea1329bb3a8d5cd25b70e3dbf73e7ded4d5ad756 it seems that when emulating an
arm core it uses `arm-core.xml` unconditionally for
`CPUClass->gdb_core_xml_file`, and that means the only feature provided
is `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

Note that even though there is a command to set the architecture in GDB, se=
tting the target architecture to an M-profile core is still not a valid wor=
karound.
This is because the target description overrides everything in setting the =
`is_m` attribute within GDB.

Reproduction of the observable:
Using the examples here https://git.linaro.org/people/peter.maydell/m-profi=
le-tests.git/tree/ .
Build the examples, and run =

```
qemu-system-arm -s -S -no-reboot -M lm3s6965evb -m 16 -serial stdio -displa=
y none -net nic -net user,restrict=3Don -d guest_errors,unimp -kernel test3=
-kern.bin
```

Then in a GDB session
```
vshcmd: > arm-none-eabi-gdb -q                                             =
