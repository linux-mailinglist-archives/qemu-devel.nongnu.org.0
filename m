VIRTIO does not limit descriptor the descriptor len field to PAGE_SIZE,
so I don't think there is a limit at the VIRTIO level.

If this function coalesces adjacent pages then the descriptor chain
length issues could be reduced.

Yes, Split Virtqueues have a fundamental limit on indirect table size
due to the "next" field. Packed Virtqueue descriptors don't have a
"next" field so descriptor chains could be longer in theory (currently
forbidden by the spec).

Limiting msize to the 9p transport device's maximum number of
descriptors is conservative (i.e. 128 descriptors =3D 512 KB msize)
because it doesn't take advantage of contiguous memory. I suggest
leaving msize alone, adding a separate limit at which requests are split
according to the maximum descriptor chain length, and tweaking
pack_sg_list() to coalesce adjacent pages.

That way msize can be large without necessarily using lots of
descriptors (depending on the memory layout).
