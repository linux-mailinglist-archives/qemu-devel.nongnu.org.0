Hi Drew,

Thank you for posting the patches, they seems to work well
because the softlockup is gone and the timestamp jump of
dmesg and ftrace record also disappeared after the guest
is virsh resume'ed.

Let me add comments.
I think the kvm-adjvtime behavior should be the default.
How about introducing 'kvm-noadjvtime' parameter instead?
kvm-noadjvtime is to provide the old behavior.

That is because the time jump occurs timeout for timers even though
the timer doesn't reach the timeout in the guest time.

For example, below flow shows that user and/or kernel sets timer A
for +10 sec and B for +20 sec in Guest, then Guest is suspended and
it passes 60 sec, then Guest is resumed. Timer A and B go off because
the Guest timestamp (TS) is jumped to 63. That is unexpected timer
behavior for Guest.

 Host TS(sec) Guest TS(sec) Event
 ============ ============= =============================
 00           00            Guest: Set timer A for +10 sec
 01           01            Guest: Set timer B for +20 sec
 03           03            Host: virsh suspend Guest
 63           63            Host: virsh resume Guest
                            Guest: Timer A and B go off

I believe kvm-adjvtime behavior is as following. So Time A
and B go off as expected time. So, kvm-adjvtime behavior should
be the default.

 Host TS(sec) Guest TS(sec) Event
 ============ ============= =============================
 00           00            Guest: Set timer A for +10 sec
 01           01            Guest: Set timer B for +20 sec
 03           03            Host: virsh suspend guest
 63           03            Host: virsh resume guest
 70           10            Guest: Timer A goes off
 81           21            Guest: Timer B goes off

Thanks,
Masa
