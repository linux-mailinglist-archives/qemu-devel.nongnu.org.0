I don't think missing delay should cause any problem either just pointed 
this out as a difference from real controller which may have an effect but 
I agree this is probably not a problem.

Problem with that patch is that it removes this clearing from the func 
that's also used to emulate ISA IDE ioports which according to their spec 
should clear irq on read so that function should be OK but maybe should 
not be called by PCI IDE code?

What I meant was where is ide_ioport_read() is called in this case when we 
have a PCI IDE controller? Searching for it I think it may come from 
pci_ide_data_read() in hw/ide/pci.c. This document:

http://www.bswd.com/pciide.pdf

has some info on this and there are mentions of status using Alternate 
Status (which does not clear interrupt bit) but I think that corresponds 
to pci_ide_cmd_read() which already uses ide_status_read() so that seems 
correct. I did not find anything about contents of the Command Block in 
this doc which the function with ide_ioport_read call implements so not 
sure if that's expected to clear interrupt in PCI native mode or should we 
change pci_ide_data_read() to avoid that.

Except the legacy IDE spec that does say reading status is clearing IRQ 
but not sure PCI native mode should do the same but it seems to use the 
same function in QEMU so it will clear IRQ as in legacy IDE mode. But this 
Linux driver says IRQ is cleared on read for PCI as well:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/ata/libata-sff.c

as does the CMD646 driver:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/ata/pata_cmd64x.c

in cmd64x_sff_irq_check() although for different chip revisions it uses 
cmd648_sff_irq_* functions which does this differently and avoids reading 
status reg and clears irq explicitely. It also has a warning at the 
beginning that UDMA mode is broken on most of these chips so it won't try 
to use it on anything below CMD646U2 so this suggests maybe there's a 
problem with clearing IRQs on at least some CMD646 chip revisions. I think 
the Sun Ultra 10 used CMD646U but not sure what the Solaris driver expects 
and if it can work with later chip revisions. Maybe we should either 
emulate the chip bugs or change something to identify as CMD646U2 which 
should behave more like stadard PCI IDE controllers? Although if I got 
that correctly Linux thinks revisions over 5 are OK and QEMU has 7.

I think we need advice from someone more knowledgeable about real hardware 
on this.
