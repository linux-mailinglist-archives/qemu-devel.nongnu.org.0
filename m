This send me digging through the code, because if two threads can call
this at the same time for passthrough, we'd also have the same problem
for virtual.

If I followed the code correctly, all I/O instruction interpretation is
currently serialized via qemu_mutex_{lock,unlock}_iothread() (see
target/s390x/kvm.c respectively target/s390x/misc_helper.c). This
should mostly be enough to avoid stepping on each other's toes.

Why mostly? I'm not sure yet whether we handling multiple requests for
passthrough devices correctly yet (virtual should be fine.)

Start vs. (start|halt|clear) is fine, as the code checks whether
something is already pending before poking the kernel interface.
Likewise, halt vs. (start|halt|clear) is fine, as the code checks for
halt or clear and start and halt use different regions. The problematic
one is clear, as that's something that's always supposed to go through.
Probably fine if clear should always "win", but I need to think some
more about that.
