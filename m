I stand corrected. Sorry for the horrible mix up and I realized that some
how I copied the same terminology at other 2 other places as well, maybe
under sleep duress :(. I will correct it in later versions.

To be frank, I actually meant association of "mp-affinity" and the
"proc number" as given by GICR_TYPER register for the vgic. I guess reading
this register using kvm_gicr_acces/KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_REDIST_REGS from
QEMU lands up in vgic vgic_mmio_read_v3r_typer() which forms the reg value
using "vcpu-id" and "mpidr"(fetched from MPIDR_EL1).

Also, value of the MPIDR for vcpu is set during KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT IOCTL
from QEMU after the creation of the vcpus(using KVM_CREATE_VCPU). I guess
this is done during reset of all of the system regs  SYS_MPIDR_EL1 value
is also reset to default within function reset_mpidr() derived using below
logic:

                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
          MPIDR   |||  Res   |   Aff2  |   Aff1   |  Aff0    |
                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                                \          \          \   |     |
                                 \   8bit   \   8bit  \  |4bit|
                                  \<------->\<------->\|<-->|
                                   \          \          \|     |
                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
         VCPU-ID  |  Byte4  |  Byte2   |  Byte1   |  Byte0  |
                   +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Perhaps once the VM is inited the value present in the MPIDR_EL1 for vcpu c=
annot
be changed and hence the vgic GICR_TYPER will have fixed association betwee=
n
"vcpu-id" and "mpidr" as well.

ok. effectively this also means that even in the upcoming SoCs, which
might have SMT capability, the value of MT bit should continue to be 0
at the KVM level for the MPIDR of the vcpus?

Sorry for this mix-up. Yes, I meant the association between the mp-affinity
and the proc number as given by GICR_TYPER for vgic as explained earlier.

MPIDR_EL1 of the vcpu is effectively being derived by KVM using the
'vcpu-id' provided by the QEMU during vcpu creation/init time. so isn't it
kind of being indirectly configured by QEMU even now?

Also. I was wondering if it was safe to present hardware threads as cores
in the virtual topology being set at the QEMU level?

wouldn't they be migrated to some other vcpu after current vcpu to which
they are associated gets offlined as part of the cpu hot-unplug action?

Like in case of the NIC, it gets notified about this and the affinity is
changed so the interrupts should not remain pending. Is it something
different about storage?=20

Requires minimalistic change which amounts to:
1. Allocation of the logical cpu-id and associating with acpi-id/hw-id
   coming from qemu/ACPI Tables.
2. During init time parsing the MADT Table entries to get the exact count
   of the possible and present cpus. This as you know shall be used to
   size up the guest data structures. Most of this infrastructure already
   exist in smp.c but still requires some adjustment of the code.

I will be sharing these changes this week.
