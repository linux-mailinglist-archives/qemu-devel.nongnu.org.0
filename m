Okay, I wanted to make sure 1-thread is still going through the glib
thread pool. So it's the same code path regardless of the
--thread-pool-size=3D value. This suggests the performance issue is
related to timing side-effects like lock contention, thread scheduling,
etc.

There is batching at the virtio and eventfd levels. I'm not sure if it's
coming into play here but you would see it by comparing vmexits and
eventfd reads. Having more threads can increase the number of
notifications and completion interrupt, which can make overall
performance worse in some cases.

Tools like top, vmstat, etc can give similar information. I'm wondering
what the host CPU utilization (guest/sys/user) looks like.

I think perf can record cacheline bounces if you want to check.
