Title:
  DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL booting WIndows XP with Synaptics driver
  installed

Status in QEMU:
  Expired
Status in qemu package in Debian:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Positng the issue here since I did not get any reply on the ML.

  I was trying to update some windows XP (SP3) images in kvm.

  It worked fine several times but last time I added mass storage
  drivers to sysprep and now on the second boot after reseal (the first
  is mini-setup) I get a BSOD with message
  DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. =


  It turns out that the error is unrelated to storage drivers. It is
  triggered by Synaptics driver installing for the PS2 mouse in kvm
  (which does not happen in VirtualBox or on real hardware).

  The image is originally created on hardware with MP acpi (not
  virtualization).

  qemu-kvm                  0.12.5+dfsg-2
