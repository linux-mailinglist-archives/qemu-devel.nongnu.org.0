Sounds good.

My experience with seccomp is that whitelisting syscalls is fragile
because of library dependencies.  Even glibc might invoke syscalls you
didn't expect, especially after a kernel/glibc upgrade, forcing you to
modify the whitelist.

However, once a whitelist is successfully in place it's a simple way to
reduce the syscall attack surface and I think it's worthwhile.
