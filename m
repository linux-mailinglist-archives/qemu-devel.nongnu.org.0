I picked everything starting with a "1." this time ;-)

No, honestly, since we don't have a deprecation policy in place yet, there 
was no real good criteria around this time. For the machine types < 1.3 
there was a bug with migration, so these machine types could not be used for 
reliable migration anymore anyway. But for the newer machine types, we 
likely have to decide by other means indeed.

Yeah, 5 years still seemed a little bit short to me, that's one of the 
reasons why I did not add more machine types in my patch here. I think with 
7 or 8 years, we should be on the safe side.

Any other opinions? And if we agree on an amount of years, where should we 
document this? At the top of docs/about/deprecated.rst?
