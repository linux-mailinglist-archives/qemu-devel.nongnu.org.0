Note that there are a few "structured" properties that export a QAPI
struct rather than a scalar.  Those would be a bit more complex.  Links
might also be tricky.

Another small difference that came to mind is the different object
liveness model; GObject is mostly plain old reference counting (plus the
"floating reference" idea), while in QOM reference counting is secondary
and lifetime is mostly dictated by the object tree and "unparenting".
This is more of a conceptual difference; it could be easily retrofitted
in GObject.

The main reasons were integration with QAPI, and the object tree.
Though everything I say here is a kind of reverse engineering of
Anthony's brain because there aren't really any design documents besides
what's in include/qom/object.h (and he overlooked some aspects, for
example "unparent" was introduced a few months later).

Overall I don't think there would be much benefit in reusing GObject.
It's about 3k lines of code, quite a few would stay (those implementing
the tree) and a bunch more would have to be rewritten.  I don't think
we'd have any use for most of the features that QOM lacks, such as
signals.  Also, QOM is quite well documented and we should include its
documentation in docs/devel instead.

That said, coccinell-ing efforts on QOM code are definitely a good idea
since it's quite mature now and we know better what we need.  And there
are practical advantages too, it's not just code cleanups---see how your
series shows the default value of the properties in -device foo,help.
