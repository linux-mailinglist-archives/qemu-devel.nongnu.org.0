I did indeed write the docs on QEMU's build system found in
docs/devel/build-system.txt  but it is not enough to eliminate
the maint burden of supporting both. QEMU's makefiles are just
too complex and full of unexpected effects to make it easy to
support both srcdir & builddir IMHO.

There's several scenarios discussed. Currently we don't do anything to
prevent src-dir builds, so there's no need to extra make magic described
I proposed a patch to add a warning, but it still allows src-dir builds,
so nothing functional has changed.

We could forbid src-dir builds now and add the magic to redirct to a
build-dir. That would work, but I don't think we should block src-dir
builds in make, assuming we have a switch to meson arriving in the
near-ish future.

Once we switch to Meson there will inevitably be some disruption in
build system ussage as it is a completely new tool. That makes it a
good flag day for forbidding src-dir builds. Given that it is a flag
day, I don't think there's any need to create makefile magic at that
time.


IMHO we shouldn't be so afraid of change that we need to try to preserve
every precise way of working we've had in the past. In the long term this
frame of mind holds back the project and promotes a negative impression
of QEMU as an old, outdated project resistant to any kind of change.

Daniel
