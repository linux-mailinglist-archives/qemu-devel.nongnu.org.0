Works for me with the current QEMU master branch... can you still
reproduce the issue with the latest version of QEMU (either v4.2 or the
master branch)?

Title:
  socket network not working

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  The socket network type is no longer working in 2.8.0.

  When trying to establish a network between 2 qemu instances:

  The listening host:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -netdev socket,id=3Din0,listen=3D127.0.0.1:9999 -devic=
e virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Din0

  works fine, but for the second one:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -netdev socket,id=3Din0,connect=3D127.0.0.1:9999
  -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Din0

  It fails with:

  qemu-system-x86_64: -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Din0: Property
  'virtio-net-device.netdev' can't find value 'in0'

  netstat shows a new connection to port 9999 in time_wait state every
  time.

  host: kernel 4.4.38, 64bits.

  It was working fine with previous version.
