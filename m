No, no!
It seems that pulseaudio has a name for each connection, and a name for e=
ach
steam within that connection.

The suggestion is that we use the VM name for the connection,
(which will be unique per VM usually, at least the user can make it be so=
)
and then use the audiodev id for each stream. Of course for multiple VMs,
the audiodev ids will be the same, but this is all right since you can
always distinguish them that the streams come from different VMs.

Also note that this thing is cosmetic from the correctness point of view,
that is pulse-audio internally has no problem with duplicate IDs.

The thing is useful mostly for tweaking the output streams in the pavucon=
trol,
where the names will allow you to easily know which steam is which.

Speaking of this, there is another minor feature missing, which is volume=
 level
feedback from pavucontrol to the guest. That means that if you change the=
 volume of the
stream in pavucontrol, the guest will not be aware of this, and still thi=
nk that the
volume is the same.
But for 'tweaking' I was mostly thinking about assigning the input/output=
 streams to
different sound devices, which pavucontrol can do and does work very well=
.
