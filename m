Currently we would not be able to handle that properly at least
definitely in the pre-blockdev case. In blockdev case I must make sure
that it will work.

The thing is that I didn't really want to touch the pre-blockdev case
code any more, but if you decide that we should do it I'm willing to
investigate this case also for the old commands.

For libvirt we really care more whether a node is format/protocol
related or not rather than whether it's implicit or not.

In this case we could filter it by the known protocol and format driver
types and filter out the rest in cases when we e.g. detect the node
names for the pre-blockdev era cases.

(Note that even with new qemu, if an SD card is used blockdev will be
disabled).
