The need for the extra user ID or selinux context is a pain;
but probably warranted for the vTPM;  in general though some of this
exists because of the choice of DBus and wouldn't be a problem for
something that had a point-to-point socket it sent everything over.

It's only the policy case I worry about; and my point here is if we
decide to use dbus then we have to think properly about security and
defined stuff.

You can lock those down pretty easily though.
