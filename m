Patch 10/17 has:

That's the use case: when copying into a destination file, it's useful=20
to know if the destination already reads as all zeroes, before=20
attempting a fallback to bdrv_make_zero(BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK) or calls=20
to block status checking for holes.

Yes, there will still be cases where you have to use --target-is-zero=20
because the image itself couldn't report that it already reads as=20
zeroes, but there are also enough cases where the destination is already=20
known to read zeroes and it's a shame to tell the user that 'you have to=20
add --target-is-zero to get faster copying even though we could have=20
inferred it on your behalf'.

My argument for taking the series _is_ that the common case can be made=20
more efficient without user effort.  Yes, we still need the knob for=20
when the common case isn't already smart enough, but the difference in=20
avoiding a pre-zeroing pass is noticeable when copying images around=20
(and more than just for qcow2 - my followup series to improve NBD is=20
similarly useful given how much work has already been invested in=20
mapping NBD into storage access over https in the upper layers like ovirt).
