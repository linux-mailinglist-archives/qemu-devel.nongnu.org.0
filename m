Note that this is just a comment describing what the existing
macro does, as a way to distinguish its job from that of the
new macro I'm adding.

What happens here is that t2 is a type like "foo [32]", ie
it is an array type already. t1 is the base 'foo' type; so the macro
is checking that t1[n] matches t2, where n is passed in to us
and must match the declared array size of the field (32 in
my example). (In C the size of the array is carried around as
part of its type, and must match on both sides of the expression;
so if you pass in the name of an array field that's the wrong size the
type check will fail, which is what we want.)
