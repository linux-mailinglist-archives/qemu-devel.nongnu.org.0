job_cancel() doesn't go through job_exit(). It calls job_completed()
onyl for jobs that are not started yet, and it sets job->cancelled, so
that job_completed() takes the job_completed_txn_abort() path, which is
not changed by this patch.

I _think_ this is okay, but it shows that the whole job completion
infrastructure is becoming way too complicated. We're late for 5.0, so
let's take this patch for now, but I think we should use the 5.1 release
cycle to clean up this mess a bit.
