IIRC, the subchannel is not enabled when the device is in STANDBY?

Anyway, it seems the check here is more like a safety measure, in case
we messed up.

Hm, if you put it like that... maybe leaving it as -EIO makes more sense.

The main question is: What happens if userspace triggers I/O to be
started and we find the device to have become not operational? Can we
even switch the state to NOT_OPER before we try the ssch (which will
fail with cc 3)? If not, it's probably safe to leave the -EIO in place.
