Specifically, we're doing it for drivers that access a fixed-size image,
i.e. block devices rather than regular files. We don't want to do this
for drivers where the file size could be changed, but just didn't
implement it.

So I would suggest calling the function more specifically something like
bdrv_co_truncate_blockdev(), and not using it as an automatic fallback
in bdrv_co_truncate(), but just make it the BlockDriver.bdrv_co_truncate
implementation for those drivers where it makes sense.

And of course, we only need these fake implementations because qemu-img
(or .bdrv_co_create_opts) always wants to create the protocol level. If
we could avoid this, then we wouldn't need any of this.
