I do have it set up, so I'm not sure why it didn't work as planned.=20
I'll make sure v2 follows the order I intended.

For _this_ patch, my goal is to preserve pre-existing practice. Where we=20
think pre-existing practice is wrong, we can then improve it in other=20
patches (see patch 6, for example).

I _think_ the reason for this original limitation is as follows: If an=20
image can be resized, we could choose to perform 'create(size=3D0),=20
truncate(size=3Dfinal)' instead of 'create(size=3Dfinal)', and we want to=
=20
guarantee the same behavior. If truncation can't guarantee a zero read,=20
then why is creation doing so?

But as I did not write the original patch, I would welcome Max's input=20
with regards to the thought behind commit ceaca56f.

qcow2 had that mode, at least before patch 5.
