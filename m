yes, I should change this

I find the idee good, but what about making it really machine agnostic 
by removing names and using a generic

     smp_constraints(MachineState *ms,
             int *nb_levels,
             int *levels[]
             );

Level can be replaced by another name like container.
The machine could also provide the level/container names according to 
its internal documentation.

Pierre
