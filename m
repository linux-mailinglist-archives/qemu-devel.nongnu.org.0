when it comes to merge, broken test == broken build,
in addition I don't like negative example.
what we are missing currently is answer to "why" #is there,
and that's is answered by below the rest is just distraction to me.

It doesn't belong to #6 and most of it is just one of the possible
justifications we can make up.
#1 is about turning hard error into warning to let test pass while

Try to concise and do not add extra sentences unless you have to.
