We also need to fix that segfault.

Ah. This mess is still going on. I've not been testing with this
particular combination because the kernel didn't support it.
The kernel code assumes that the implementation made the choice
(which is an option in the spec) to not have any HDM decoders
for the pass through case. As such it never programmed them
(if you dig back a long way in the region bring patch sets in the
kernel you'll find some discussion of this). Now I knew that meant
the configuration didn't 'work' but nothing should be crashing -
unless you mean that something in linux userspace is trying to
access the memory and crashing because that fails
(which is fine as far as I'm concerned ;)

The work around for QEMU testing so far has been to add another root
port and put nothing below that. The HDM decoders then have to be
implemented so the kernel does what we expect.

I'm not against a more comprehensive fix.  Two options come to mind.
1) Add an option to the host bridge device to tell it not to implement
   hdm decoders at all. I'm not keen to just automatically drop them
   because having decoders on a pass through HB is a valid configuration.
2) Cheat and cleanly detect a pass through situation and let the accesses
   through.  I'm not particularly keen on this option though as it
   will fail to test the code once it's 'fixed' in Linux.  IIRC the spec
   doesn't say that programming such an HDM decoder is optional.

I guess we could be a bit naughty with option 1 and flip the logic even
though it would break backwards compatibility. So default to no HDM decoder.
I doubt anyone will notice given that's the configuration that would have
worked.  However I would want to keep the option to enable these decoders
around.  I can spin up a patch or do you want to do it? My suggestion is option
1 with default being no HDM decoder.

You have a mix of spaces and tabs for indentation. Should all be 4 spaces
for QEMU code.

Why is this code specific to a pass through decoder?
All it's telling us (I think) is no one tried to commit the decoder yet.
