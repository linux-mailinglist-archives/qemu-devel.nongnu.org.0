The node insert/remove functions were added at the block generic layer.
COR-filter options structure was added to the QAPI.
The test case #310 was added to check the 'bottom' node limit for COR.
The 'supported_read_flags' member was added to the BDS structure
(with the flags check at the block generic layer for drivers).

v12:
  02: New.
  03: Only the temporary drop filter function left.
  05: New (suggested by Max)
  06: 'base' -> 'bottom' option.
  07: Fixes based on the review of the v11.
  08: New.
  09: The comment ext was modified.
  10: The read flags check at the block generic layer.
  11: COR flag was added.
  12: The condition was fixed.
  13: The 'backing-file' parameter returned. No deprecation.
  14: The COR-filter 'add' function replaced with the 'insert node' generic
      function. Fixes based on the review of the v11.

  iotests: add #310 to test bottom node in COR driver
  block: modify the comment for BDRV_REQ_PREFETCH flag
  block: include supported_read_flags into BDS structure
  copy-on-read: add support for read flags to COR-filter
  copy-on-read: skip non-guest reads if no copy needed
  stream: skip filters when writing backing file name to QCOW2 header
  block: apply COR-filter to block-stream jobs
