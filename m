Great! You are the primary bug wrangler, so if you are interested in 
trialing it, I am interested in helping!

If we enable the bug tracker, can we please add Thomas and myself as 
'Reporter' level contributors to QEMU so we can wrangle bugs?

Info on permissions: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html

There's also an old bug (2 years) about migrating Launchpad to Gitlab, 
but there's been no movement.

https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/22600

If we like the results of the trial, we'll need a convincing migration 
strategy.
