Yeah, if this can only happen if QEMU code is broken then
an assert is OK. I was just trying to find out what the
cause was, since "this is buggy" isn't specific about where
the bug is.

> Or should we audit all ptimer calls?

I don't think we specifically need an audit. We could perhaps
expand the comment by the assert to specifically say that if
the calculation of the next event overflowed then this indicates
a bug in the QEMU device model using the ptimer API, so if
somebody else runs into the assert they have a hint about
what to look at. (An overflowed next_event indicates a time
incredibly far in the future, given that it's a nanosecond
time in an int64_t.)

The other approach I thought of would be to make the ptimer
code handle this sort of after-the-end-of-QEMU-universe time
by saturating next_event to INT64_MAX rather than letting it
overflow and wrap. Unfortunately while this would be fine for
the 'timer event' part of the code, it would break
ptimer_get_count() which calculates the current counter
value by looking at the difference between the current
time and the time of the next event (fixable but only with
a bunch of messing about to treat a next_event of INT64_MAX
as equivalent to the counter being disabled and tracking
the counter value in s->delta). So an assert is the
best thing I think.
