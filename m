Yes, and balloon says bye bye when running in PV mode is only a secondary
objective. I've compiled some references:

"To summarize, the necessary conditions for a hack along these lines
(using DMA API without VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM) are that we detect that:

  - secure guest mode is enabled - so we know that since we don't share
    most memory regular virtio code won't
    work, even though the buggy hypervisor didn't set VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM" 
(Michael Tsirkin, https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/20/1021)
I.e.: PV but !VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM \implies bugy hypervisor


"If VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is set then things just work.  If
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is clear device is supposed to have access to
all of memory.  You can argue in various ways but it's easier to just
declare a behaviour that violates this a bug."
(Michael Tsirkin, https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/21/1626)
This one is about all memory guest, and not just the buffers transfered
via the virtqueue, which surprised me a bit at the beginning. But balloon
actually needs this.

"A device SHOULD offer VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM if its access to memory
is through bus addresses distinct from and translated by the platform to
physical addresses used by the driver, and/or if it can only access
certain memory addresses with said access specified and/or granted by
the platform. A device MAY fail to operate further if
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not accepted. "
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/cs01/virtio-v1.1-cs01.html#x1-4120002)

I didn't understand the last part. I believe conserving the user
specified value when not running in PV mode is better than the hard
overwrite I did here. I wanted a discussion starter.

I think the other option (with respect to let QEMU manage this for user,
i.e. what I try to do here) is to fence the conversion if virtio devices
that do not offer VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM are attached; and disallow
hotplug of such devices at some point during the conversion.

I believe that alternative is even uglier.

IMHO we don't want the end user to fiddle with iommu_platform, because
all the 'benefit' he gets from that is possibility to make a mistake.
For example, I got an internal bug report saying virtio is broken with
PV, which boiled down to an overlooked auto generated NIC, which of
course had iommu_platform (VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM) not set.

AFAIK nothing. The guest needs to share the pages, and everything works.
Janosch, can you help me with this one?

It is, but any guest having sovereignty about its memory may need
something similar.

No this is something different. We need stronger guarantees than the
streaming portion of the DMA API provides. And what we actually want
is not DMA but something very different.

It is wrong in a sense. Drivers are mostly supposed to be portable. But
balloon is not a run of the mill device. I don't see any other way to
make this work.

Let me try to reword this. The point of PV is that the guest has
exclusive access to his pages unless the guest decides to share some
of the using a dedicated ultravisor call.

The point of the memballoon is, as far as I understand, to effectively
dynamically manage the guests memory size within given boundaries, and
without requiring memory hotplug. The basic idea is that the pages in
the balloon belong to the host. The host attempting to re-use a
non-shared page of a guest leads to problems. AFAIR the main problem
was that shall we ever want to deflate such a page (make it again
available for guest use) we would need to do an import, and that can
only work if we have the exact same content as when it was exported.
Otherwise integrity check fails as if we had a malicious hypervisor,
that is trying to inject stuff into the guest.

I'm sure Janosch can provide a better explanation.

I really don't see another way, how memory ballooning could work with
something like PV, without the balloon driver relinquishing the guests
ownership of the pages that are going to leave the guest via the balloon.

On that note ccing the AMD SEV people. Balloon is at this point
dysfunctional for them as well. @Tom: Right? If yes what problems need to
be solved so virtio-balloon can work under SEV?
