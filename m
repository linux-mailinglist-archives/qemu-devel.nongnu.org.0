The problem is that the way you create the dynamic-memory-v2 property
relies on knowing whether a GPA is DIMM or NVDIMM -but you can't in
the presence of hotplug.  Using the default address allocation, DIMMs
and NVDIMMs are dynamically assigned addresses in the hotplug memory
area.

So, if you have an NVDIMM plugged at boot time, you'll mark that range
of LMBs as invalid.  If you then unplug it, and instead plug in a
regular DIMM (before the guest has even tried to online the NVDIMM),
it will probably use the same GPA range.  You therefore need regular
LMB DRCs for that range, and we have no way to communicate that to the
guest.

Similar problems if you go the other way (unplug DIMM, plug NVDIMM).

Yes, but AIUI, the way PC describes DIMMs and NVDIMMs in ACPI are
pretty similar.  In PAPR they are gratuitously different - we don't
even have the concept of a DIMM, only the individual LMBs that go into
it.  The match between the DIMM backend and the PAPR LMB frontend is
already pretty poor, covering NVDIMMs in the same range pushes it past
breaking point.
