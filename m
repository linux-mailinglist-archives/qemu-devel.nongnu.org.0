Why?

The only place you need to recover pc_end is when processing an
exception and for that case the front end should be using
cpu_loop_exit_restore() to ensure registers are valid before the
exception is processed. Otherwise you know where you've been given the
next block starts at pc_next (with -d nochain).

However I suspect if you want to build more sophisticated tools to track
execution the plugin approach might be better. This seems like a bit of
an arbitrary addition to the TCG core for a single use case where we
already have logging facilities that will give you the same information.
