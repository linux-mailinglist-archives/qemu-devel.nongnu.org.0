That sounds like you have a file named '1' in the directory where the=20
echo was run.  Unquoted [1] is a shell glob that expands to '1' if that=20
file exists, otherwise remains unexpanded as '[1]'.

Yes.  Figuring out why a file named '1' is being created is also a=20
useful exercise, but quoting any time you have [ that you want output is=20
already a good idea.
