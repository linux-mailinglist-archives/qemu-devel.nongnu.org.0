Looking through old bug tickets ... can you still reproduce the issue
with the latest version of QEMU (v4.2) and a more recent Linux
distribution?

Title:
  qemu 2.7.x 2.8 softmmu dont work on BE machine

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Build on Be machine qemu 2.7.1 and 2.8 in pure softmmu (tgc) dont work on=
 big endian hardware .
  tested with ppc-softmmu,i386-softmmu,arm-softmmu same result:

  with :
   ./qemu-system-i386 =

  Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "overlay-scrollbar"
  qemu-system-i386: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x000a0000
  This usually means one of the following happened:

  (1) You told QEMU to execute a kernel for the wrong machine type, and it =
crashed on startup (eg trying to run a raspberry pi kernel on a versatilepb=
 QEMU machine)
  (2) You didn't give QEMU a kernel or BIOS filename at all, and QEMU execu=
ted a ROM full of no-op instructions until it fell off the end
  (3) Your guest kernel has a bug and crashed by jumping off into nowhere

  This is almost always one of the first two, so check your command line an=
d that you are using the right type of kernel for this machine.
  If you think option (3) is likely then you can try debugging your guest w=
ith the -d debug options; in particular -d guest_errors will cause the log =
to include a dump of the guest register state at this point.

  Execution cannot continue; stopping here.

  =

  I try to add the -L option with ../pc-bios/bios.bin =

  and have the same result.

  note the ppc-softmmu and ppc64-softmmu work in kvm mode only emulated
  mode have issue.

  =

  tested on my hardware a  Qriq P5040 and G5 4x970MP with Ubuntu Mate 16.10 =

  thanks
  Luigi
