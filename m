Hi Vlad,

the ipxe-qemu package in Ubuntu (1.0.0+git-20190109.133f4c4-0ubuntu3) is
built with DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS enabled (in "src/config/general.h").
According to the Ubuntu changelog, this is a new feature added in
"1.0.0+git-20190109.133f4c4-0ubuntu1".

With DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS enabled, I can reproduce the issue locally,
with iPXE built from source at git commit 133f4c4 (which you report the
issue for), and also at current iPXE master (9ee70fb95bc2).

The issue does not reproduce (with DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS enabled) at
commit fbe8c52d. This suggests the problem should be bisectable.

If I disable DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS, then the problem goes away even at
133f4c4 (i.e., the issue is masked).

I've used current edk2 master to test with (14c7ed8b51f6).

Viewed at 133f4c4:

The DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS feature test macro seems to result in iPXE
attempting to gather entropy. (Likely for setting up TLS connections.)
For entropy gathering, iPXE seems to use an EFI timer, and to measure
jitter across one timer tick. In this, iPXE plays some tricks with the
UEFI TPL (Task Priority Level).

In general, iPXE seems to want to run at TPL_CALLBACK most of the time,
to mask the timer interrupt in most code locations, and drops down to
TPL_APPLICATION only when it actively wants a timer callback (for the
jitter collection, see above).

When the iPXE driver is launched, the StartImage() UEFI boot service
takes a note of the current TPL. It is TPL_APPLICATION (value 4). Then
iPXE seems to perform the above trickery with TPL_CALLBACK & entropy
collection. Finally, after installing EfiDriverBindingProtocol and
EfiComponentName2Protocol, the iPXE driver exits (as expected from a
UEFI driver model driver -- the entry point function is only supposed to
perform some setup steps & install some protocol interfaces). At this
point, StartImage() verifies whether the TPL has been restored to the
same as it was before launching the driver.

Unfortunately, something about the TPL manipulations in iPXE is
unbalanced, because I see the following TPL changes:

- raise: APPLICATION (4) -> CALLBACK (8)
- raise: CALLBACK (8) -> NOTIFY (16)
- raise: NOTIFY (16) -> NOTIFY (16)
- restore: NOTIFY (16) -> NOTIFY (16)
- restore: NOTIFY (16) -> CALLBACK (8)

Note that the final "restore: CALLBACK (8) -> APPLICATION (4)"
transition is missing, before iPXE exits. This is what StartImage()
catches and reports with the failed ASSERT().

So, as I mentioned, the problem is bisectable. Here's the bisection log:

The bisection fingers d8c500b7945e ("[efi] Drop to TPL_APPLICATION when
 gathering entropy", 2018-03-12) as first bad commit.

Feel free to report this problem on the upstream iPXE mailing list.

Regarding Ubuntu downstream, you should be able to work around this
issue by #undef-ing DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS again, in
"src/config/general.h" -- *minimally* in the CONFIG=3Dqemu build(s). That
is, in the ipxe-qemu subpackage.

That's because in a CONFIG=3Dqemu build, you totally don't need (or even
*use*) the iPXE HTTPS infrastructure (the entropy gathering that trips
the ASSERT seems spurious to me, with CONFIG=3Dqemu). With CONFIG=3Dqemu,
iPXE provides the UEFI SNP (Simple Network Protocol) interface on top of
the e1000 NIC, and the crypto stuff (if any) is done by the platform
firmware (edk2 / OVMF).

Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64 (ver 4.2) stuck at boot with OVMF bios

Status in iPXE:
  New
Status in ipxe package in Ubuntu:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  The version of QEMU (4.2.0) packaged for Ubuntu 20.04 hangs
  indefinitely at boot if an OVMF bios is used. This happens ONLY with
  qemu-system-x86_64. qemu-system-i386 works fine with the latest ia32
  OVMF bios.

  NOTE[1]: the same identical OVMF bios works fine on QEMU 2.x packaged wit=
h Ubuntu 18.04.
  NOTE[2]: reproducing the fatal bug requires *no* operating system:

     qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF-pure-efi.fd

  On its window QEMU gets stuck at the very first stage:
     "Guest has not initialized the display (yet)."

  NOTE[3]: QEMU gets stuck no matter if KVM is used or not.

  NOTE[4]: By adding the `-d int` option it is possible to observe that
  QEMU is, apparently, stuck in an endless loop of interrupts. For the
  first few seconds, registers' values vary quickly, but at some point
  they reach a final value, while the interrupt counter increments:

  NOTE[5]: Just to better help the investigation of the bug, I'd like to re=
mark that the issue is NOT caused by an endless loop of triple-faults. I tr=
ied with -d cpu_reset and there is NO such loop. No triple fault whatsoever.

  NOTE[6]: The OVMF version used for the test has been downloaded from:
  https://www.kraxel.org/repos/jenkins/edk2/edk2.git-ovmf-x64-0-20200515.13=
98.g6ff7c838d0.noarch.rpm

  but the issue is the same with older OVMF versions as well.

  =

  Please take a look at it, as the bug is NOT a corner case. QEMU 4.2.0 can=
not boot with an UEFI firmware (OVMF) while virtualizing a x86_64 machine A=
T ALL.

  Thank you very much,
  Vladislav K. Valtchev
