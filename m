It contains path information which is used for lookup into lower layer.

Overlay is storing its metadata in trusted.* xattrs. If a user modifies
metadata, then various kind of bad things can happen. I think one can
do some kind of checks on metadata to make sure it does not crash
atleast.

And that's true for any filesystem. Isn't. If user manages to modify
metadata outside of filesystem, then lot of bad things can happen. I
thought that's the reason that people are not comfortable with the
idea of allowing mounting filesystem from inside user namespace because
it makes it easy to mount a hand crafted filesystem.

Anyway, I think overlayfs is just one use case of trusted xattr. Even
if overlayfs moves away from trusted xattr, what about other users.
We need to have a story around how will we support trusted xattrs
safely.

I thought qemu and kvm are the one who should ensure we should not be
able to break out of sandbox. Kernel implementation could be as 
buggy as it wanted to be. We are working with this security model
that kernel is completely untrusted.

They enable certain features in overlayfs. In fact, we fall back to
lesser capability on if we are running on ext4/xfs. For virtiofs, 
we deny the mount completely.

        /*
         * We allowed sub-optimal upper fs configuration and don't want to break
         * users over kernel upgrade, but we never allowed remote upper fs, so
         * we can enforce strict requirements for remote upper fs.
         */
        if (ovl_dentry_remote(ofs->workdir) &&
            (!d_type || !rename_whiteout || ofs->noxattr)) {
                pr_err("upper fs missing required features.\n");
                err = -EINVAL;
                goto out;
        }

Agreed that we need to look into whether having CAP_SYS_ADMIN allow
virtiofsd to break out of jail. 

May be we need to provide that remapping trusted xattr feature so
that we don't have to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN in init_user_ns and can
provide this emulation even when running in user namespace.
