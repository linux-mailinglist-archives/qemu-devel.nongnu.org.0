Hi; thanks for this report. (This kind of bug report is better sent
to qemu-devel or to the launchpad bug tracker -- qemu-discuss
is mostly user-to-user conversations, and developers tend to
be on -devel; I've cc'd -devel on this.)

Our official support policy is that we support building with the
two most recent versions of macOS; in practice we might support
building with some earlier versions; as of commit 5588840ff77800e839
we definitely dropped support for anything earlier than 10.10.
So in theory we don't strongly care about anything before 10.13
at the moment; but if it's easy to avoid the problem it might be
worth doing that.

Alex, it looks like the relevant commit was one of yours.
Could you have a look at how easy it would be to support
systems without clock_gettime/CLOCK_MONOTONIC ?
I notice that other places in QEMU have #ifdeffery for
a lack of CLOCK_MONOTONIC, so we should ideally be
consistent, and either support systems without it, or else
say we require it and remove the remaining legacy ifdefs...

thanks
