This is a good explanation.

Currently, the *only* action that occurs in the firmware before
selecting "etc/table-loader", is fetching the selector key, and size, of
"etc/table-loader".

Therefore, if the ACPI re-generation does not affect the size of
"etc/table-loader", just the size of "etc/acpi/tables" -- and QEMU
updates the size in the fw_cfg directory for "etc/acpi/tables" --, then
there is indeed no need for updating the firmware.

I was just not sure if QEMU could guarantee this invariant (i.e. that
the size of "etc/table-loader" would not change). After all, if you
modify the ACPI tables in the "etc/acpi/tables" blob, possibly even add
new tables to it, then you will likely have to append new *commands*,
for those additional ACPI objects / tables, to the linker-loader script
in "etc/table-loader".

Right, that's good.

Exactly.

It really depends on whether the platform devices hot-plugged before
platform reset require new commands in the linker/loader script.

Thanks
