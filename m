Yep, that's what I've already done on nbd images.

nbdkit has '--filter=truncate' which rounds an image size up to 
alignment by reading the absent tail as zeros, and permitting writes 
that rewrite zero but failing with EIO any write that would attempt to 
change the tail.  We may eventually want that complexity in qemu's block 
layer for ALL drivers (as part of switching the block layer to 
byte-accurate sizing everywhere), but that's a LOT more effort.  The 
short term of just mandating alignment is much easier and still defensible.

Do we have any iotest coverage of this new message?  (If none of our 
existing tests broke, then you should add one...)
