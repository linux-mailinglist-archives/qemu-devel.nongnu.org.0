Yeah, it's similar, but the granularity is per-device instead of
per-file, and it would be metadata that is introspectible.

(As part of the help files and the CLI, when you look at a list of
devices, I'd like to show which devices are in which support tiers.)

The scope of each system is meant to be just a little different --
describing source files for git management vs describing logistical
in-application API constructs.

Still, you're right -- there's a lot of overlap. I'm not sure how to
best bridge them.

Though I would like to re-engage on the idea that we should be
mechanically consuming and testing our MAINTAINERS file to ensure 100%
coverage as a CI check. IIRC there was some pushback to this idea
because we weren't sure who should own basic/generic files like
"LICENSE" or "README" and so on.

For files that SHOULD go "maintainerless", for which we would like
checkpatch.pl to simply show you "who touched it last", maybe we should
create a "Community Managed" section in MAINTAINERS that explicitly
lists these files; and get_maintainer amended to understand this section.

Maybe if we get the maintainers file getting checked regularly as a
first step it will help us bridge the gap into device metadata without
worrying about info desync.

Just brainstorming.

(Slightly OT: I am working on an email that contains a quick code-tour
overview of what every file in the root of the document is, including
which are maintained and unmaintained. Might be a good jumping off point
for more MAINTAINER file discussions?)
