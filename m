Well my thought is that currently you can do  'make -C roms efi' from
the unpacked release tarball, and with this change, that no longer
works. So we ought to explain what to do to get that working again.

This doesn't neccessarily means docs. It could just be 'make' prints
out an error telling people what to do, or figure it out itself.

If we split off the entire of the 'roms' directory into a self-contained
firmware-src tarball, the 'roms/Makefile' would still "just work".

With regards,
Daniel
