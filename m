At least Fujitsu Siemens PRIMEPOWER250 had a tty attached to the
16550A UART. I think there were more such machines. I don't expect
there is anything in the Solaris kernel which would prevent any serial
device known to it to be used as a tty.

Well, theoretically yes, but practically there is just one baudrate
which can be specified in the OBP. I think it's perfectly safe to use
max(rxrate,txrate), or min(rxrate,txrate), whatever you prefer.
