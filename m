Agreed, though it seems to reduce VM's downtime while do checkpoint, but
It doesn't help to reduce network latency, because the network packages whi=
ch are
Different between SVM and PVM caused this checkpoint request, it will be bl=
ocked
Until finishing checkpoint process.

The second one is not merged, which can help reduce the downtime.

> Hailang, are you ok with that?

Yes. @Derek, please feel free to pick it up if you would like to ;)
