Yes, I think it's good.

still, I'd like to put it more explicitly to make ensure it's not missed:
the reason we want to specify compatible_type as a trait and check
whether target compatible_type is the superset of source
compatible_type is for the consideration of backward compatibility.
e.g.
an old generation device may have a mdev type xxx-v4-yyy, while a newer
generation  device may be of mdev type xxx-v5-yyy.
with the compatible_type traits, the old generation device is still
able to be regarded as compatible to newer generation device even their
mdev types are not equal.

Thanks
