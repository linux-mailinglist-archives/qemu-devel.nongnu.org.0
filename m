I agree that the dotted key syntax is our chosen / solved design
for expressing JSON on the CLI. I would also say that, in retrospect,
this was a incorrect design decision that is one of the key things
responsible for QEMU having a bad reputation for complexity.

We should simply never have tried to invent a way to map the full
hiearchy of JSON onto the CLI as the result will always be unpleasant.
The dotted notation is the most verbose way to do this type of
configuration, because of the string repetition it requires for
nested structures.

Lets consider how libvirt uses blockdev for a LUKS volume stored
in iSCSI

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -object secret,id=3Dlibvirt-5-storage-secret0,\
    data=3D9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/1=
,\
    keyid=3DmasterKey0,iv=3DAAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D,format=3Dbase64 \
  -object secret,id=3Dlibvirt-5-format-luks-secret0,\
    data=3D9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/1=
,\
    keyid=3DmasterKey0,iv=3DAAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D,format=3Dbase64 \
  -blockdev '{"driver":"iscsi","portal":"example.org:6000",\
    "target":"iqn.1992-01.com.example:storage","lun":1,"transport":"tcp",\
    "user":"myname","password-secret":"libvirt-5-storage-secret0",\
    "node-name":"libvirt-5-storage","auto-read-only":true,"discard":"unmap"=
}' \
  -blockdev '{"node-name":"libvirt-5-format","read-only":false,"driver":"qc=
ow2",\
    "encrypt":{"format":"luks","key-secret":"libvirt-5-format-luks-secret0"=
},\
    "file":"libvirt-5-storage"}' \

We all know JSON is horrible on the CLI, no surprise. So

Lets use human "friendly" dotted syntax instead:

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -object secret,id=3Dlibvirt-5-storage-secret0,\
    data=3D9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/1=
,\
    keyid=3DmasterKey0,iv=3DAAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D,format=3Dbase64 \
  -object secret,id=3Dlibvirt-5-format-luks-secret0,\
    data=3D9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/1=
,\
    keyid=3DmasterKey0,iv=3DAAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D,format=3Dbase64 \
  -blockdev driver=3Dqcow2,node-name=3Dlibvirt-5-format,read-only=3Dfalse,\
    encrypt.format=3Dluks,encrypt.key-secret=3Dlibvirt-5-format-luks-secret=
0,\
    file.driver=3Discsi,file.portal=3Dexample.org:6000,\
    file.target=3Diqn.1992-01.com.example:storage,file.lun=3D1,file.transpo=
rt=3Dtcp,\
    file.user=3Dmyname,file.password-secret=3Dlibvirt-6-storage-secret0,\
    file.node-name=3Dlibvirt-5-storage,file.auto-read-only=3Dtrue,file.dica=
rd=3Dunmap

I don't think that's much of an improvement, aside from not having
to worry about matching "}".

If we move to JSON in a config file

  $ cat qemu.json
  {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "arg": "object",
        "data": {
          "type": "secret",
          "id":"libvirt-5-storage-secret0",
          "data": "9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91u=
EHCn6j/1",
          "keyid": "masterKey0",
          "iv": "AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D",
          "format": "base64"
        }
      },
      {
        "arg": "object",
        "data": {
          "type": "secret",
          "id":"libvirt-5-format-luks-secret0",
          "data": "9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91u=
EHCn6j/1",
          "keyid": "masterKey0",
          "iv": "AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D",
          "format": "base64"
        }
      },
      {
        "arg": "blockdev",
        "data": {
          "node-name":"libvirt-5-format",
          "read-only":false,"driver":"qcow2",
          "encrypt":{
            "format":"luks","key-secret":
            "libvirt-5-format-luks-secret0"
          },
          "file":{
            "driver": "iscsi",
            "portal": "example.org:6000",
            "target":"iqn.1992-01.com.example:storage",
            "lun": 1,
            "transport": "tcp",
            "user": "myname",
            "password-secret": "libvirt-5-storage-secret0",
            "node-name":"libvirt-5-storage",
            "auto-read-only":"true",
            "discard":"unmap"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -f qemu.json

The config file is more volumous than the CLI, but it is also
massively more intelligible to humans because you can see the
structure of the data.

I still screwed up many times with missing quotes, incorrect
commas, etc. All the fun of JSON

So if we allowed YAML instead of JSON, now we get...

  $ cat qemu.yaml
  ---
  arguments:
  - arg: object
    data:
      type: secret
      id: libvirt-5-storage-secret0
      data: 9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/=
1
      keyid: masterKey0
      iv: AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D
      format: base64
  - arg: object
    data:
      type: secret
      id: libvirt-5-format-luks-secret0
      data: 9eao5F8qtkGt+seB1HYivWIxbtwUu6MQtg1zpj/oDtUsPr1q8wBYM91uEHCn6j/=
1
      keyid: masterKey0
      iv: AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODw=3D=3D
      format: base64
  - arg: blockdev
    data:
      node-name: libvirt-5-format
      read-only: false
      driver: qcow2
      encrypt:
        format: luks
        key-secret: libvirt-5-format-luks-secret0
      file:
        driver: iscsi
        portal: example.org:6000
        target: iqn.1992-01.com.example:storage
        lun: 1
        transport: tcp
        user: myname
        password-secret: libvirt-5-storage-secret0
        node-name: libvirt-5-storage
        auto-read-only: true
        discard: unmap
  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -f qemu.yaml

This is finally something I'd consider to be on a par with the
original QEMU syntax, before we added hierarchical data. You
have the minimal possible amount of syntax here. No commas,
no quotes, no curly brackets, etc.

I'm sure there are things about YAML that are not nice, but
at some point there's a tradeoff where we can declare it
"good enough". You mention that it has a huge design spec,
but does that really matter ? We shouldn't be implemneting
a parser or formatter ourselves, just re-use one that
already exists. What matters more is whether it is nice
for humans & machines, and I think it is a good syntax
in both those cases.

No matter what we do implementation / designwise, the pre-requisite for
all of them is that we're able to fully express the configuration of the
VM using QAPI. As a side effect this means that -loadconfig and -writeconfi=
g
become usable in the real world, which is nice for the current users of
qemu-system-XXX.  Per my reply to John though, I think we could consider
being more ambituous & seek to obslete qemu-system-XXX entirely at some
point in the future.

Yeah and it gets worse the older / more mature a project is. This
is what pushes projects into doing a clean break "2.0" design,
which is something we've never done for QEMU.  I don't mean just
breaking backcompat in a handful of CLI args here. I mean a proper
scorched earth, everything is up for re-evaluation, "2.0".
