I'm modifying qtest to allow the server and client to co-exist within
the same process (facilitating coverage-guided fuzzing). One of the
modifications is making qtest_sendf directly call a function in
qtest.c. All the other qtest commands are sent with a single
qtest_sendf call, so the qtest.c function could immediately call
qtest_process_command. This breaks if the command is sent with
different qtest_send/socket_send calls, as in b64write.

It should be simple to change qtest_server_inproc_recv (the qtest.c 
receiver) to
wait for an "\n" prior to qtest_process_command, so I will probably do 
that and
then normal(socket) qtest will keep the memory-reduction benefits of the
non-"atomic" approach.

As a side note, would qtest_memwrite, also benefit from splitting up the 
send
command?

      for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
          sprintf(&enc[i * 2], "%02x", ptr[i]);
      }

      qtest_sendf(s, "write 0x%" PRIx64 " 0x%zx 0x%s\n", addr, size, enc);
      qtest_rsp(s, 0);
      g_free(enc);
