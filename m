My intention was to add the caller also in the same patch where the
function is added. I think I missed it when I split. Thanks!

I completely agree that we better avoid duplication But I am bit
hesitant in this case because,
1) Low level functions which help in creating the namespace/static
tables are already common (ex: aml_append)

2) Using these basic routines, individual platforms can create the
namespace with appropriate devices and the methods.

ACPI name space is tightly coupled with a platform. While there may be
common devices like processors, uart etc, there can be difference in the
ACPI methods for each of those devices. For ex: CPU objects for one
platform may support _LPI method. uart may support _DSD for one platform
and other may use totally different UART. If we have to create common routines,
we will have to decide on all parameters the common function would need for
different platforms. Same concern with fw_cfg/virtio etc which look same
now but in future one platform can add a new method for these devices.

IMHO, even though it looks like we have the same function in each architecture
currently, this model allows us to have platforms with different devices with
different methods/features. Creating common routines now would probably make
them difficult to use in future. 

acpi_align_size() is a simple wrapper. We don't need it if we directly
use the common function.

Since I see insistence let me try moving few functions like fw_cfg (virtio, pci in
future) to a common file in hw/acpi.

Sure.
