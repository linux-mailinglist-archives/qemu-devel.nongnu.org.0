Keeping the semantics is normally a good idea, but the common sense in the 
QEMU project is to rather use g_malloc() for small allocations (if 
allocating some few bytes already fails, then the system is pretty much dead 
anyway), and only g_try_malloc() for huge allocations that really might fail 
on a healthy system, too.

We should likely add some text to our coding style document to make this 
more obvious...

Sounds good, thanks!
