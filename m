Oh yeah, I understand that. But it doesn't explain why initiator needs 
to be specified for NUMA nodes with cpus and memory, or does it? Maybe 
I'm still misunderstanding what the initiator is.

And this one is still unanswered too. Because from user's perspective, 
initiator has to be set on all NUMA nodes (if HMAT is enabled) and it 
seems like this auto assignment code is not run/not working.
