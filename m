I think we have a concrete example for the above discussion. The AHCI.
When running the virtio-iommu on x86 I get messages like:

virtio_iommu_translate sid=250 is not known!!
no buffer available in event queue to report event

and a bunch of "AHCI: Failed to start FIS receive engine: bad FIS
receive buffer address" messages (For each port)

This was reported in my cover letter (*). This happens very early in the
boot process, before the OS get the hand and before the virtio-iommu
driver creates any mapping. It does not prevent the guest from booting
though.

Currently the virtio-iommu device checks the VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS. If I
overwrite it to true in the device, then, the guest boots without those
messages.

I share Peter's concern about having a different default policy than x86.

Thanks

Eric

Note the migration issue reported in the cover letter is fixed now and
was due to the migration priority unset.
