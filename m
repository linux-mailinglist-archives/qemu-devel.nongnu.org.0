I think this makes sense. IME it is not common to include copyright /
author info the module help text, as that s non-technical information.

Including author info in API docs in particular I think is liable to
be harmful becuase it will encourage users to directly email
individual authors for help, rather than using collective comms
channels like the mailing lists or forum or bug tracker.

And of course all of this author and copyright info is generally
horribly out of date, as people rarely add themselves when modifying
existing files.

As long as you don't remove the copyright info entirely, that satisfies
the license requirements to preserve copyright notices.

Daniel
