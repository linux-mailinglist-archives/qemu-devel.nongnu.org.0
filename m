Yes, but cpu_reset() ends up calling cpu_common_reset()
at the moment (every subclass uses cpu_class_set_parent_reset()
to put in its own reset implementation and save a pointer to
the base class reset function, which it then invokes from
its own reset method). A DeviceClass::reset changeover works
exactly the same way.

(I have some working code for this, just need to test it a bit
more and satisfy myself that there aren't any weird places
that call DeviceClass::reset on a CPU object and expect it
to be a no-op like it is right now. I don't think there should be
any since a CPU object is never on a qbus, and none of the
direct calls to functions that do device-object resets are
dealing with CPUs.)

Where does it do that? cpu_class_init() sets CPUClass::reset
to cpu_common_reset and doesn't touch DeviceClass::reset:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=hw/core/cpu.c;h=fe65ca62aceef581d4d9ef3cb9e1b0d7df4e5bfa;hb=HEAD#l416
(the two reset methods have different type signatures so
you wouldn't be able to assign cpu_common_reset() to
DeviceClass::reset without an ugly and undefined-behaviour
cast...)

My work-in-progress patch does:
 * cpu_reset() calls device_cold_reset()
 * all the targets, plus the base TYPE_CPU class, implement
   DeviceClass::reset instead of CPUClass::reset
 * CPUClass::reset goes away entirely
It passes 'make check' and 'make check-acceptance', so it's
basically right, I think.

Note that this does not do anything about the need for each
machine or whatever to use qemu_register_reset() to arrange
to call cpu_reset() -- that is necessary because CPU objects
are not on any qbus, so they don't get reset when the qbus
tree rooted at the sysbus bus is reset, and that doesn't change.
That's a different and much trickier problem to try to tackle
(I don't currently have any good ideas for how we would want
to approach it).
