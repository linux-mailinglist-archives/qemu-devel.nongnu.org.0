Then in that case you would indeed need to preallocate all the metadata,
both on creation and on resize.

Then if you read the image with an older version of QEMU you would get
the exact same contents in both cases.

You would still have problems with images created with raw data files
but without preallocation.

Coincidentally, data_file and data_file_raw were both introduced in QEMU
4.0 so in practice there's no official QEMU release that can read an
image with an external data file but does not support data_file_raw.

But in theory it could happen of course.
