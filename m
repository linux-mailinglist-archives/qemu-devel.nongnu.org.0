Yes, the device state representation is their responsibility. We can't
do that for them since they define the hardware interface and internal
state.

As Michael and Paolo have mentioned in the other thread, we can provide
guidelines and standardize common aspects.

vfio-user devices will normally be instantiated in one of two ways:

1. Launching a device backend and passing command-line parameters:

     $ my-nic --socket-path /tmp/my-nic-vfio-user.sock \
              --model https://vendor-a.com/my-nic \
=09      --rss on

   Here "model" is the device model URL. The program could support
   multiple device models.

   The "rss" device configuration parameter enables Receive Side Scaling
   (RSS) as an example of a configuration parameter.

2. Creating a device using an RPC interface:

     (qemu) device-add my-nic,rss=3Don

If the device instantiation succeeds then it is safe to live migrate.
The device is exposing the desired hardware interface and expecting the
right device state representation.

If you wish to reflect those differences in the device model URI then
you can use:

  https://qemu.org/devices/pci/<vendor-id>/<device-id>/<subvendor-id>/<subd=
evice-id>

Another option is to use device configuration parameters to express
differences.

The important thing is that this device model URI has one owner. No one
else will use qemu.org. There can be many different e1000e device model
URIs, if necessary (with slightly different hardware interfaces and/or
device state representations). This avoids collisions.

> And is it possible to have a list of URIs here?

A device implementation (mdev driver, vfio-user device backend, etc) may
support multiple device model URIs.

A device instance has an immutable device model URI and list of
configuration parameters. In other words, once the device is created its
ABI is fixed for the lifetime of the device. A new device instance can
be configured by powering off the machine, hotplug, etc.

A device instance's configuration parameters are immutable.
rx-filter-size=3D16 cannot be migrated to rx-filter-size=3D32.

Yes, configuration parameters can describe capabilities. I think of
capabilities as something that affects the guest-visible hardware
interface (e.g. the RSS feature bit is enabled) that is mentioned in the
text, but it would be clearer to mention them explicitly.

There seems to be no consensus on this yet. It's the question of how to
manage the lifecycle of VFIO, mdev, vhost-user, and vfio-user devices.
There are attempts to standardize in some of these areas.

For mdev drivers we can standardize the sysfs interface so management
tools can query source devices and instantiate destination devices
without device-specific code.

For vhost-user devices there is the backend program conventions
specification, which aims to standardize common parameters. This makes
integrating support for new device implementations easier (there is less
device implementation-specific code).

For vfio-user devices something based on the vhost-user backend program
conventions spec could work well.

The main issue could be that avoiding vendor-specific provisioning code
in management software either requires you to restrict yourself to a few
standard device types or to pass through configuration data.

A libvirt opinion would be interesting.

Versions are just aliases for a list of configuration parameters. For
example, version=3D2 expands to rx-filter-size=3D32. The purpose of version=
s
is to provide a human-readable shorthand notation.

Versions are not involved in migration compatibility checking, instead
the device model URI and expanded configuration parameters are compared.

The version has no direct effect on the device state representation. It
has an indirect effect due to the configuration parameters that it
expands to. For example, the rx-filter-size=3D32 configuration parameter
may change the device state representation to include the 32 addresses
that the device is filtering on.

No "version check" is necessary when loading the device state
representation because the device was already instantiated with the
exact configuration parameters that determine the device state
representation.

This is an important question and I'm not sure.

The problem with subsection semantics is that they break rollback. Once
the old device state has been loaded by the new device implementation,
saving the device state produces the new device state representation.
The old device implementation can no longer load it :(.  Manual
intervention is necessary to tell the new device implementation to save
in the old representation.

In the migration model described in this document it works the other
way around: back and forth migration is always safe. If you wish to
change the device you need to create a new instance (after poweroff or
through hotplug).

One way of achieving something similar is to provide additional
information about safe transitions between configuration parameter
lists. It is not safe to change arbitrary device configuration
parameters, but certain parameters can be safely changed.

I'm not sure if the complexity is worth it though. The downside to the
current approach is that devices must eventually be reconfigured to
upgrade to new versions, even if there is no guest-visible hardware
interface change.
