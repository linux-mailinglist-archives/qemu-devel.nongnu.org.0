So a given mdev type can only support a single model, model just gives
us some independence from the vendor driver association of the mdev
type?  I wonder how "model" is really different from the "name"
attribute on an mdev type other than being more formalized.

These are not feasible semantics, multiple tasks may be instantiating
devices simultaneously, we can't lock a sub-hierarchy of sysfs while
one process configures features to their liking.  It seems more like
these attributes would be read-only to advertise support, but be
applied as part of the write to create, ie. we'd append device specific
attributes after the uuid string, similar to how we've previously
discussed supporting device aggregation.

How exactly is this different from an mdev type?  An mdev type is
supposed to define a software compatible device configuration.  If
version 2 is not compatible with version 1, we'd expect a vendor to
define a new type.  In practice vendors are often defining new types to
indicate the scale of a device, for example with vGPUs types may
different in the amount of graphics memory per instance.  The topic of
"aggregation" came about as a generic way to describe this within a
single type, when for example we might have an untenable number of
scaling increments to describe each as a separate type.  Unfortunately
"aggregation" is also too generic, "aggregation of what" needs to be
more clearly defined.

I think we want instances of objects to expose their device and
configuration through sysfs, we don't want to require userspace to use
different methods for different flavors of devices, nor should it be
required for someone to remember how a device was instantiated.

Should we not require that any sort of configuration like this occurs
through sysfs?  We must be able to create an instance with a specific
configuration without using vendor specific tools, therefore in the
worse case we should be able to remove and recreate an instance as we
desire without invoking vendor specific tools.  Thanks,

Alex
