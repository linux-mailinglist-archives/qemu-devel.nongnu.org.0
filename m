+
+    To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.
+    1. Create a change description in the format specified below to
+       use in the source control commit log.
+    2. Your commit message must include your "Signed-off-by" signature,
+       and "Contributed-under" message.
+    3. Your "Contributed-under" message explicitly states that the
+       contribution is made under the terms of the specified
+       contribution agreement.  Your "Contributed-under" message
+       must include the name of contribution agreement and version.
+       For example: Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement =
1.1
+       The "TianoCore Contribution Agreement" is included below in
+       this document.
+    4. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
+       that the project documents on its web page.  If the process is
+       not documented, then submit the code on development email list
+       for the project.
+    5. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
+       copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
+       then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:
+       * BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
+       * BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
+       * MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
+       * Python-2.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0
+       * Zlib: http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib
+
+       For documentation:
+       * FreeBSD Documentation License
+         https://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html
+
+       Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be
+       accepted.
+
+       Contributions using other licenses might be accepted, but further
+       review will be required.

+
+    To make a contribution to a TianoCore project, follow these steps.
+    1. Create a change description in the format specified below to
+       use in the source control commit log.
+    2. Your commit message must include your "Signed-off-by" signature,
+       and "Contributed-under" message.
+    3. Your "Contributed-under" message explicitly states that the
+       contribution is made under the terms of the specified
+       contribution agreement.  Your "Contributed-under" message
+       must include the name of contribution agreement and version.
+       For example: Contributed-under: TianoCore Contribution Agreement =
1.0
+       The "TianoCore Contribution Agreement" is included below in
+       this document.
+    4. Submit your code to the TianoCore project using the process
+       that the project documents on its web page.  If the process is
+       not documented, then submit the code on development email list
+       for the project.
+    5. It is preferred that contributions are submitted using the same
+       copyright license as the base project. When that is not possible,
+       then contributions using the following licenses can be accepted:
+       * BSD (2-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause
+       * BSD (3-clause): http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause
+       * MIT: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
+       * Python-2.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/Python-2.0
+       * Zlib: http://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib
+
+       Contributions of code put into the public domain can also be
+       accepted.
+
+       Contributions using other licenses might be accepted, but further
+       review will be required.
