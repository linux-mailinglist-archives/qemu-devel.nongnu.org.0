Since Alex had a nit on patch 1 I'm going to assume you'll
respin this series once we're reopen for 5.0 development.

I think we have two plausible choices for DIT:
 (1) don't implement it, since we can't make the timing
     guarantees it suggests
 (2) implement it but not actually change our behaviour:
     this is technically a lie to the guest, but it means
     that guest OS handling of the PSTATE.DIT bit etc can
     be tested

At the moment we by default do (1). I think we should
probably postpone doing (2) until somebody actually
asks us for it.
