Ok, I'll send out a MAINTAINERS patch tomorrow or so to make that
co-maintainer upgrade official. But I obviously still need a while to learn=

the bureaucracy involved for PRs, signing, ML tools, Wiki, etc.

Sure, sounds like a plan!

Okay.

The only thing I actually still need to figure out for this patch series to=
 be=20
complete (at least from my side), is how to fix the test environment bug=20

est=20
somehow ...
