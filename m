But what about my suggestion of adding something like:

{ 'union': 'BlockdevAmendOptions',

  'base': {
      'node-name':         'str' },

  'discriminator': { 'get_block_driver(node-name)' } ,

  'data': {
      'file':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsFile',
      'gluster':        'BlockdevCreateOptionsGluster',
      'luks':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsLUKS',
      'nfs':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsNfs',
      'parallels':      'BlockdevCreateOptionsParallels',
      'qcow':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsQcow',
      'qcow2':          'BlockdevCreateOptionsQcow2',
      'qed':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsQed',
      'rbd':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsRbd',
      'sheepdog':       'BlockdevCreateOptionsSheepdog',
      'ssh':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsSsh',
      'vdi':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsVdi',
      'vhdx':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsVhdx',
      'vmdk':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsVmdk',
      'vpc':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsVpc'
  } }


This shouldn't be hard to do IMHO.
