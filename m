I think the obvious and easy place is start using lcitool is for the
tests/docker/dockerfiles/*.  All that's required is to add mappings
to lcitool for the various deps that QEMU has which libvirt does not
already have. Then we should be able to start auto-generating the
dockerfiles without too much difficulty. This will be a significant
step forward because it will help us keep te package lists in sync
across all the dockerfiles which is a major fail in QEMU right now.


Dealing with tests/vm replacement or these ansible recipes is likely
to be a significantly more challenging proposition. Perhaps we can
again start by just automating creation of the package lists that
the tests/vm and ansibile recipes need, as again those are all
inconsistent.

Daniel
