Hi,

This version reads good to me. :)

Tested the exmaple; this works!

Nit: Consider hyper-linking "virtual environments" to:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv

(I realize, within context people will recognize the term "virtual
environment" is not a virtual guest environment, but a Python venv.  I
have a mild preference for being explicit here.)
