I personally think there is a little bit of over-engineering here.
Let's start with the spec:

    Power Indicator Blinking
    A blinking Power Indicator indicates that the slot is powering up or
powering down and that
    insertion or removal of the adapter is not permitted.

What exactly is an interpretation here?
As you stated, the races are theoretical, the whole point of the indicator
is to let the operator know he can't plug the device just yet.

I understand it would be more user friendly if the QEMU would wait
internally for the
blinking to end, but the whole point of the indicator is to let the
operator (human or machine)
know they can't plug the device at a specific time.
Should QEMU take the responsibility of the operator? Is it even correct?

Even if we would want such a feature, how is it related to this patch?
The patch simply refuses to start a hotplug operation when it knows it will
not succeed.

Another way that would make sense to me would be  is a new QEMU interface
other than
"add_device", let's say "adding_device_allowed", that would return true if
the hotplug is allowed
at this point of time. (I am aware of the theoretical races)

The above will at least mimic the mechanics of the pyhs world.  The
operator looks at the indicator,
the management software checks if adding the device is allowed.
Since it is a corner case I would prefer the device_add to fail rather than
introducing a new interface,
but that's just me.

Thanks,
Marcel
