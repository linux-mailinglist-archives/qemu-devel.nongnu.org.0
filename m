I don't know the x86 specific side that much; but from my migration side
the answer should mostly be through machine types - indeed for smi-count
there's a property 'x-migrate-smi-count' which is off for machine types
pre 2.11 (see hw/i386/pc.c pc_compat_2_11) - so if you've got an old
kernel you should stick to the old machine types.

There's nothing guarding running the new machine type on old-kernels;
and arguably we should have a check at startup that complains if
your kernel is missing something the machine type uses.
However, that would mean that people running with -M pc   would fail
on old kernels.

A post-load is also a valid check; but one question is whether,
for a particular register, the pain is worth it - it depends on the
symptom that the missing state causes.  If it's minor then you might
conclude it's not worth a failed migration;  if it's a hung or
corrupt guest then yes it is.   Certainly a warning printed is worth
it.
