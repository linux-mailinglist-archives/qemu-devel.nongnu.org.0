I think the number that most users are interested in is knowing how much
space the image for their /dev/vda takes up on the host.

I can see how they might be interested in not only that one image file,
but all other image files connected to it, i.e. their /dev/vda with all
of its snapshots. This would mean counting backing files. I think adding
up the numbers for this should be done in the management layer.

I can possibly also imagine users wanting to count everything that's
even loosely connected to their /dev/vda, like copies of it. I doubt,
however, they want to count only copies that are currently being made,
but not snapshots and copies that have been completed earlier. So this
is clearly a management layer thing, too.

It's a special case, yes. But see below.

We could also introduce a mode with an Electoral College so that
sometimes an image that missed the majority has a chance to win anyway.

They are, but drivers that want to count more than their primary node
are exceptions, too. And I think you're more likely to remember adding
the callback when you want to have a certain feature, not when you don't
want to have it.

I really think we're likely to forget adding the callback where we need
to disable the feature.

I can see two options that should address both of our views:

1. Just don't have a fallback at all, make the callback mandatory and
   provide implementations in block.c that can be referred to in
   BlockDriver. Not specifying the callback causes an assertion failure,
   so we'd hopefully notice it quite early (assuming that we run either
   'qemu-img info' or 'query-block' on a configuration with the block
   driver, but I think that's faily safe to assume).

2. Make the 90% solution a 100% solution: Allow drivers to have multiple
   storage children (for vmdk) and then have the fallback add up the
   primary child plus all storage children. This is what I suggested as
   the documented semantics in my initial reply to this patch (that you
   chose not to answer).

   Adding the size of storage children covers qcow2 and vmdk.

   As the job filter won't declare the target or any other involved
   nodes their storage nodes (I hope), this will do the right thing for
   them, too.

   For quorum and blkverify both ways could be justifiable. I think they
   probably shouldn't declare their children as storage nodes. They are
   more like filters that don't have a single filtered node. So some
   kind of almost-filters.
