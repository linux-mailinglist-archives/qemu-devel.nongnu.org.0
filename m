Title:
  Keyboard keys get stuck

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Keyboard keys get "stuck" quite often, on certain Linux guests at
  least, and start repeating themselves until another key is pressed.
  This is especially noticeable with key combinations like Ctrl+V for
  pasting. When it happens, you get the pasted text and
  vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv...

  This bug has been present for quite some time but I don't remember any
  specific version that had it first.

  =

  QEMU version: 5.1.0
  Guest: Debian stable 64-bit (live), with Gnome desktop (may occur with ot=
her Linux guests too)
  Host: Arch Linux with KDE desktop (X11, wayland not tested); both default=
 and hardened kernel tested

  QEMU start command:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 6G -cpu host -smp 3 -cdrom debian.iso -=
boot d -vga std
