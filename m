Alice Frosi is working on a qemu-storage-daemon-based project where the
FUSE export type is useful. In this case qemu-storage-daemon is used
stand-alone without a guest or libvirt directly involved. The goal is
just to export disk images and how they are consumed is the user's
responsibility (processes, containers, guests).

I have CCed Miklos Szeredi, the Linux FUSE maintainer, to check what the
options are for unprivileged mounting of a FUSE file system:

1. libfuse invokes open("/dev/fuse") + mount()
2. libfuse spawns the fusermount3 suid root helper
3. Any other options? D-Bus? etc

NBD exports are useful for networks but shouldn't preclude other export
types from being merged just because they can be implemented on top of
NBD. Native export types are simpler to manage and have less performance
overhead than stacking additional tools on top of NBD.
