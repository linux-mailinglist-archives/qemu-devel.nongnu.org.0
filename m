- the schema is configured at build time. The C QAPI types depend on build
conditions. (although I don't take that into account yet, but that
shouldn't be too hard to add)
- one of the goals is to start rewriting some part of QEMU in Rust. Here, I
started with qemu-ga because it's an "easy" target.

Generating binding for QMP schema (the protocol) is slightly easier, since
the JSON messages are loosely typed. Yet, we would probably recommend you
do it from qmp introspect output, at runtime. How close that is from the
original QAPI schema, I can't tell, I never really looked or used it (it's
not human friendly to start with, iirc)

Now, I am confident various people are trying to improve the situation wrt
meson+cargo integration, I'll do some more research.

thanks

&gt; <br>
&gt; Hi,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Among the QEMU developers, there is a desire to use Rust. (see previou=
s<br>
&gt; thread from Stefan &quot;Why QEMU should move from C to Rust&quot;, th=
e rust-vmm<br>
&gt; related projects and other experiments).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks to our QAPI type system and the associate code generator, it is=
<br>
&gt; relatively straightforward to create Rust bindings for the generated C=
<br>
&gt; types (also called sys/ffi binding) and functions. (rust-bindgen could=
<br>
&gt; probably do a similar job, but it would probably bring other issues).<=
br>
&gt; This provides an important internal API already.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Slightly more complicated is to expose a Rust API for those, and provi=
de<br>
&gt; convenient conversions C&lt;-&gt;Rust. Taking inspiration from glib-rs=
<br>
&gt; binding, I implemented a simplified version of the FromGlib/ToGlib<br>
&gt; traits, with simpler ownership model, sufficient for QAPI needs.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The usage is relatively simple:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - from_qemu_none(ptr: *const sys::P) -&gt; T<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Return a Rust type T for a const ffi pointer P.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - from_qemu_full(ptr: *mut sys::P) -&gt; T<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Return a Rust type T for a ffi pointer P, taking ownership=
.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - T::to_qemu_none() -&gt; Stash&lt;P&gt;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Returns a borrowed ffi pointer P (using a Stash to destroy=
 &quot;glue&quot;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0storage data, if any).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - T::to_qemu_full() -&gt; P<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0Returns a ffi pointer P. (P resources are leaked/passed to=
 C/ffi)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; With those traits, it&#39;s relatively easy to implement the QMP callb=
acks.<br>
&gt; With enough interest, we could eventually start rewriting QGA in<br>
&gt; Rust, as it is a simple service. See qga/<a href=3D"http://qmp.rs" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">qmp.rs</a> for some examples.<br>
&gt; We could also try to tackle qemu itself.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Finally, given that the QAPI types are easy to serialize, it was simpl=
e<br>
&gt; to use &quot;serde&quot; on them, and provide a D-Bus interface for QM=
P with zbus.<br>
&gt; (a similar approach could probably be taken for other protocols, that<=
br>
&gt; could be dynamically loaded... anyone like protobuf better?)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This PoC modifies qemu-ga to provide the interface on the session bus:=
<br>
&gt; $ qga/qemu-ga -m unix-listen -p /tmp/qga.sock -t /tmp -v<br>
&gt; $ busctl --user introspect org.qemu.qga /org/qemu/qga org.qemu.QgaQapi=
<br>
&gt; ...<br>
&gt; $ busctl --user call org.qemu.qga /org/qemu/qga org.qemu.QgaQapi<br>
&gt; GuestSetVcpus aa\{sv\} 1 2 logical-id x 0 online b 1<br>
&gt; ...<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Note: the generated code doesn&#39;t work with the qemu schema, there =
is a<br>
&gt; couple of fixme/todo left.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Shameful pain point: meson &amp; cargo don&#39;t play nicely together.=
<br>
<br>
Do we actually need/want it to be in the same monolithic repo<br>
as qemu, as opposed to a qemu-qapi-rust repo ?<br>
<br>
Trying to weld together different build systems is never that<br>
attractive. The language specific build systems generally are<br>
much simpler if they&#39;re self contained. From a distro POV it<br>
can be better if the language bindings are self contained, as<br>
you don&#39;t neccessarily want to build the language binding in<br>
the same environment as the main app. For example with modules<br>
