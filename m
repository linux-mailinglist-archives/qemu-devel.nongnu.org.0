Good point. And if I recall, didn't we already have a discussion (or 
even patches) to optimize whether querying the format layer during block 
status was even worth the effort, depending on heuristics of the size of 
the format layer which in turn is based on whether there was 
preallocation?  So not a show-stopper.

I also wonder if Berto's subcluster patches might play into this scenario.

Or worded differently, is bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate even still 
necessary (when it is documented only to cover the PREALLOC_NONE case), 
or should we get rid of it in favor of using BDRV_REQ_ZERO_WRITE 
everywhere instead?  (Which in turn involves visiting all drivers that 
previously advertised bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate... but I already have 
work in my tree trying to do that as part of preparing to add an 
autoclear bit to qcow2 to make it faster to report when a qcow2 image is 
known all-zero content...)

Looks like I'll be rebasing my work on top of this series.
