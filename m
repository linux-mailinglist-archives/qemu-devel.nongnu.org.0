Hard to say ... the problem only occurs occasionally, and I've never
seen it happen "live", only in the CI logs after the job has failed. I
guess you'd have to print timestamps in the code and then submit a lot
of jobs to the CI systems that are sensitive to this problem (e.g.
Cirrus and Travis) to find out...
