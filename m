It's a special case that avoids COW for write zeroes, but not for 
anything else. The moment you write any data (whether to the 
zero-above-compressed or the regular compressed portion), the entire 
cluster has to be rewritten.  I'm not sure how frequently guests will 
actually have the scenario of doing a zero request on a sub-cluster, but 
at the same time, I can see where you're coming from in stating that if 
it makes management of extended L2 easier to allow zero subclusters on 
top of a compressed cluster, then there's no reason to forbid it.
