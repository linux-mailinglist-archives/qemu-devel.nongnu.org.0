Hello, Peter.

I would ask the author, Milos Stojanovic, to provide us with details you
asked for.

I am here just the integrator and the submitter, and even though I could
perhaps answer your questions accurately, I would prefer Milos as the main
person to talk to.

I would like to add that this series is already in exploation here in Wave,
for some internal projects involving QEMU. People are happy with it, it
solved some long-standing problems, and there is no known open issue
related to this code.

The solution has its own limitations, as is spelled out in commit messages,
just to keep your expectations realistic, but overall I find it incredibly
useful, and very good, given the complex problem it tackles.

I would like now to pass the =E2=80=9Cfloor=E2=80=9D to Milos.

Yours,
Aleksandar
