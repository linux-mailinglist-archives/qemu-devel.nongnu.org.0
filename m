Thanks, that helps me to understand your proposal (I had something
more complicated in mind)

"everything" is a bit too much ;) You proposal is to replace
qmp_dispatch_bh by a coroutine version (except for OOB commands). This
is nice because indeed, it allows to reenter the mainloop with a
simple yield in QMP commands. It is also simpler than my "async"
proposal, because some of the state is part of the coroutine, and
because it doesn't allow QMP commands concurrency (beside existing
OOB).

Iow, coroutine (for async) + oob (for concurrency) make my proposal
kinda obsolete. I can only regret that a simple callback-based
solution looked simpler to me than one that mixes both threads &
coroutines, but I don't mind if everybody likes it better :) I can
definitely see the point for block commands, which rely on coroutines
anyway, and qemu is already that complex in general.

Yes, I think we should have a 'coroutine': true, for commands that
should be run with a coroutine.

Or perhaps replace existing allow-oob with 'dispatch':
- 'bh' (default)
- 'coroutine'
- 'allow-oob' (oob + bh fallback, since oob don't have coroutine - at
this point)

Your patch looks quite good to me, but make check hangs. Have you looked at=
 it?
