>> - protecting dirty rate stat info:
>>    1. drop the mutext for protecting dirty rate introduced in version 4
>>    2. change the code block in query_dirty_rate_info so that requirements

>>
>> - free DirtyRateVcpuList in case of memory leak
>>
>> please review, thanks a lot.
>>
>> v4:
>> - make global_dirty_log a bitmask:
>>    1. add comments about dirty log bitmask
>>    2. use assert statement to check validity of flags
>>    3. add trace to log bitmask changes
>>
>> - introduce mode option to show what method calculation should be used,
>>    also, export mode option in the as last commmit
>>
>> - split cleanup and init of dirty rate stat and move it in the main

>>
>> - change the fields of DirtyPageRecord to uint64_t type so that we

>>
>> - introduce mutex to protect dirty rate stat info

>> v2:
