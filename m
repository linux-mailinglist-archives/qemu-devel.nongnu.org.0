I reproduced the failure with a TCG aarch64 target on x86.
I sent a separate
"[PATCH] tests: Update DSDT ACPI table for arm/virt board with PCDIMM
related changes" patch that should fix the issue.

checkpatch complains with an "ERROR: Does not appear to be a
unified-diff format patch" but I checked similar patches like d2a1b1d602
("tests: update acpi expected files") produce the same so I hope it's fine.

Thanks

Eric
