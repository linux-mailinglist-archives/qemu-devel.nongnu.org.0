We have two types of inc files - the inline C sections but also .inc.h
files. I'm not sure they should be lumped together. I think most of the
header based ones are essentially templates which get expanded multiple
times with #undef/#define blocks before each inclusion.

Hmm - I guess one workaround is to tweak editorconfig so whatever we end
up renaming things still get identified as the right type of file for
syntax hi-lighting purposes.
