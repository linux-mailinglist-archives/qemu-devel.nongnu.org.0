They why the children of a clock tree fed with constant clock stay with
a clock of 0? Who is responsible of setting their clock to the constant
value?

Ah... Maybe this is related to the generic reset problem in QEMU :(

Well, this is the point. I can't see a justification to have a clock
on a non-qdev object. We should be able to model complicated devices
with qdev.

We are having various problems with the CPUs which are non-qdev devices,
or recently even with the LED model...:
