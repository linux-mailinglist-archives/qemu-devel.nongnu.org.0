But also how such an interrupt has to be set up (currently there is no guaranty that the priority used for the NMI and the mask should stay the same across Linux version as it is purely internal to GICv3/arm64, no generic kAPI nor uAPI have access to it). And also, you would probably need to know what is handling the NMI you are injecting.

Julien, thanks for the explanation. The question we're not sure if NMI should
be injected on receiving HMP/QMP "nmi" command. It means it's not clear what
behavior we should have for this command on ARM. However, I have one more
unrelated question: "pseudo" NMI on ARM64 should be PPI? I mean SPI can't
be "pseudo" NMI.

Thanks,
Gavin
