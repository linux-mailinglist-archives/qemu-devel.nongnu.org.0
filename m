>=20

I agree it is more logical to store the frequency in clock out. But,
regarding migration constraints, we have no choice I think because a
device cannot rely on values that are migrated by another device for
restoring its state. (when I checked, I add the impression that
post_load()s are called on a per device migration basis not all at the
end of migration).

So we could store the frequency in clock out and migrate things there.
But since we have no way to ensure all clock out states are migrated
before some device fetch a ClockIn: we'll have to say "don't fetch one
of your ClockIn frequency during migration and migrate the value
yourself if you need it", pretty much like gpios.

So we will probably migrate all ClockOut and almost all ClockIn.

It would nice if we had a way to ensure clocks are migrated before
devices try to use them. But I don't think this is possible.
