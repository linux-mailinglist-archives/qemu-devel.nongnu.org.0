Hi, thanks for reviewing the patch.

We must distinguish between two cases:
1, Auto-increment is disabled.
I just run some test on SABRE Lite (i.MX6) board.
I had auto-increment disabled, I verified, that GIC is configured for 
Edge interrupts. Once count went past the compare value I got the 
interrupt. I did not touch Timer registers, just signal EOI to GIC and 
surprisingly, I got a another interrupt. If I stopped the timer 
interrupts stopped coming (Status was still set to 1).

 From this behavior I assume, that every time the Timer is incremented 
(and Timer value is past the compare value) an EDGE interrupt (that 
means actual X->0->1 transition) is asserted. This is really interesting 
from HW point of view. This would mean, that a9_gtimer_update function 
should generate the pulse and not level on compare event.

2, Auto-increment is enabled.
This is actually what the patch was aiming for.
First call of a9_gtimer_update will potentially update the compare 
value, then the interrupt and event flag is de-asserted. Second call of 
a9_gtimer_update will just update the timer (or re-assert the interrupt 
if the Timer hit the compare value in the meantime, which is fine).

Let me know I you want me to run some more tests.
