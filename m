I'm not sure if it's always uninterruptible, but yes, in general you
would be sacrificing the block node and some of its worker threads to
get the VM unstuck.

The next thing you should probably do is migrate off to another QEMU
instance without a hanging thread. But at least it would let you migrate
off instead of getting stuck while trying to wait for all running
requests to complete.

Yes, that's the same case as NBD.
