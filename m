Do you know if they want vSVA as well or only nested translation?

Yeah, let's put that stuff on hold. vSVA with virtio-iommu requires about
the same amount of work in the host kernel as vSMMU, minus the NESTED_MSI
stuff. The device implementation would be simpler, but the guest driver is
difficult (I'd need to extract the CD table code from the SMMU driver
again). And obtaining better performance than vSMMU would then require
upstreaming vhost-iommu. I do have incomplete drafts and prototypes but
I'll put them aside until users (other than hardware validation) show up
and actually need performance or things like unpinned stage-2.

Not really, for sharing guest process address spaces you need I/O page
faults. You can test PASID alone without PRI by using auxiliary domains in
the guest, so I'd advise to start with that, but it requires modifications
to the device driver.

Hm we're already mandating DVM for host SVA, so I'd say mandate it for
vSVA as well. We'd avoid a ton of context switches, especially for the zip
accelerator which doesn't require ATC invalidations. The host needs to pin
the VMID allocated by KVM and write it in the endpoint's STE.

Thanks,
Jean
