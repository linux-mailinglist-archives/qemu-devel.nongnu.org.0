Hi,

V2:
* Remove x- prefix from capability name
* Fix expected status checking
* Fix description of capability

This series adds an UUID validation at the start of the migration
on the target side. The idea is to identify the source of migration.

Possible case of problem:
1. There are 3 servers: A, B and C
2. Server A has a VM 1, server B has a VM 2
3. VM 1 and VM 2 want to migrate to the server C
4. Target of VM 1 starts on the server C and dies too quickly for some re=
ason
5. Target of VM 2 starts just after that and listen the same tcp port X, =
which
   the target of VM 1 wanted to use
6. Source of VM 1 connects to the tcp port X, and migrates to VM 2 source
7. It's possible that migration might be successful (e.g., devices are th=
e same)
8. So, the target of VM 2 is in undefined state

The series adds a capability to prevent successful (by mistake) migration=
.

The new capability validate-uuid only affects the source so that it sends
its UUID to the target. The target will validate the received UUID and st=
op
the migration if UUIDs are not equal.

Regards,
Yury
