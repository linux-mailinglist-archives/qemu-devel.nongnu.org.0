We already do "passthrough" (this is our default) and "disable" (-o no_xattr).
We probably need to implement this "mapped" mode and that will allow us
to run without CAP_SYS_ADMIN in init_user_ns.

If we figure out a way to run in a user namespace, then we don't
necessarily require this mapping functionality, right? User namespace will
automatically provide that mapping. We can just run as root of that user
namespace.

When 9p wrote this remapping method, we probably did not have user
namespace as popular as they are now. So we probably should implement
remapping of trusted xattr and then run in a user namesapce.

And complete passthrough mode will have to run in init user namespace
and this will be least securre mode (from host security point of view).
