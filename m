Excellent question.

> Will you redo this analysis/series after each releases?

Perhaps I should first explain my analysis, i.e. where my numbers come
from, then my cleanups.

Counting #include directives is not useful by itself.  For instance,
#include "qemu/typedefs.h" occurs just once, yet almost all .o depend on
it.

Better: count the actual make dependencies.  Compiling FOO.c generates
FOO.d in addition to FOO.o.  These .d list the .h the .o depend on.  I
wrote a stupid Python program to count how many .o depend on each .h.
This identifies widely included headers.

Also useful are the .d for the .c generated by "make check-headers":
they tell us how many headers each header pulls in.  Widely included
headers that pull in lots more are particularly promising candidates for
#include cleanup.

The actual cleanup is manual work.  Getting rid of copy pasta and
"convenience" headers is pretty straightforward.  "Fat" headers and
design erosion can require more thought.  Another difficult part is
identifying how to order the cleanups for reviewability.  Testing is
straightforward, but sloooow; much world-recompiling for many, many
worlds.

I started looking into this back in 2016[1], and updated the analysis
recently[2].  I contributed a few cleanups myself, and at least Paolo
also chipped in.

I can update the analysis more frequently if that helps.  However, ...

... detecting we've made things worse weeks or months after we did is
clearly suboptimal.

The actual numbers depend on build configuration.  For reproducible
numbers, we need to hold configuration constant for all developers.  I
figure our containerized builds could do that for us.

To detect metrics going south, we need a baseline, and a definition of
"south".

If we store the baseline in git and fail the test when the actual
numbers are too "south" of the baseline, patches making things a lot
worse will have to update the baseline.  This should ensure proper
scrutiny.

However, a slow slide south over multiple independent patches will=20
arbitrary blame the last one, while the others get off scot free.

I'm not sure how to best handle new headers.  Having to update the
baseline whenever you add a new header will likely add too much
friction.

Needs thought.

Perhaps we can start with fully automating the measurement part, then
passively gather data for a while to learn how the numbers change during
development.
