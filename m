OK.

OK

$ git grep 0b
accel/tcg/user-exec.c:608:    switch (((insn >> 0) & 0b11)) {
accel/tcg/user-exec.c:610:        switch (((insn >> 2) & 0b11111)) {

It now certainly does :)

Fair enough.

I looked at Previous, the Next emulator:

https://sourceforge.net/p/previous/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/cpu/memory.c#l41

Than looked around the code.
