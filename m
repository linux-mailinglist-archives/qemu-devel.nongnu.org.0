The VirtioRngDxe driver is a UEFI driver that follows the UEFI driver
model. Meaning (in this context), it is connected to the virtio-rng
device in the BDS phase, by platform BDS code.

The variable SMM driver is necessary for producing the UEFI Variable and
Variable Write architectural protocols. BDS can only be entered when all
the architectural protocols have been installed.

Therefore we have a circular dependency with the above -- assuming we
intend to delay the *startup* of the variable SMM driver until after
EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL is available.

But, perhaps, could the variable SMM driver start up anyway, and consume
EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL just when it really needs the random seed? I doubt it:
other EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL instances could be produced by other (3rd party)
UEFI drivers. Or other (3rd party) modules could "attack" VirtioRngDxe.
A privileged (SMM) driver should not consume such sensitive data from a
non-privileged driver, unless the latter was built into the platform
firmware, and the consumption occurred before the End-of-Dxe event
(which is signaled by platform BDS, early in the BDS phase).

Put differently, the non-privileged driver that's the source of the
sensitive data would have to be a "platform DXE driver". The virtio
drivers are not such drivers however.

I can imagine a roundabout way to hack this around in OVMF's platform
BDS, quite horribly, but I'd like to consider other approaches first.

Thank you!
