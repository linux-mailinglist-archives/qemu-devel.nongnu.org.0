Yes, you'd have to add --no-rebuild.

We can of course cover both.

Before unit tests were converted, it was needed because unit tests were
built part with Meson and part with Makefile rules.  Now we still need
the Makefile to build submodules.  Richard posted a patch to build
capstone from meson.build; libfdt can have the same treatment and SLIRP
can be converted to a subproject.  With that gone, there's no reason to
keep the ninja2make converter.

Even before that, it's also possible to send the build to Ninja instead
of using ninja2make.  In that case the Makefile would only spawn
recursive builds using either Make or Ninja.  That would also add a
Ninja build dependency, so I haven't proposed it yet (despite having the
patches ready).

To sum up: the hard part is done, but that means that we have to decide
in what order to do the next steps.
