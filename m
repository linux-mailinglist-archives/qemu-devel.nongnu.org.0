Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  bad performance with rng-egd backend

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  =

  1. create listen socket
  # cat /dev/random | nc -l localhost 1024

  2. start vm with rng-egd backend

  ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -mon chardev=3Dqmp,mode=
=3Dcontrol,pretty=3Don -chardev socket,id=3Dqmp,host=3Dlocalhost,port=3D123=
4,server,nowait -m 2000 -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dh1,id=3Dvnet0 -netd=
ev tap,id=3Dh1 -vnc :0 -drive file=3D/images/RHEL-64-virtio.qcow2 \
  -chardev socket,host=3Dlocalhost,port=3D1024,id=3Dchr0 \
  -object rng-egd,chardev=3Dchr0,id=3Drng0 \
  -device virtio-rng-pci,rng=3Drng0,max-bytes=3D1024000,period=3D1000

  (guest) # dd if=3D/dev/hwrng of=3D/dev/null

  note: cancelling dd process by Ctrl+c, it will return the read speed.

  Problem:   the speed is around 1k/s

  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  If I use rng-random backend (filename=3D/dev/random), the speed is about
  350k/s).

  It seems that when the request entry is added to the list, we don't read =
the data from queue list immediately.
  The chr_read() is delayed, the virtio_notify() is delayed.  the next requ=
est will also be delayed. It effects the speed.

  I tried to change rng_egd_chr_can_read() always returns 1,  the speed
  is improved to (about 400k/s)

  Problem: we can't poll the content in time currently

  =

  Any thoughts?

  Thanks, Amos
