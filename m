Is it necessary?  Several of our newer block interfaces have required 
node names, rather than permitting alternation.  If we rewrite the 
existing HMP commands to operate on top of the new QMP command, it is 
still possible for HMP to support drive names even when QMP does not.  I 
don't think the complexity of worrying about drive names is worth it; 
after all, the QMP command is new enough that the only libvirt that will 
use it is also a libvirt that knows how to use -blockdev, and thus node 
names are sufficient.

Yes, we can add drive ids later if I turn out to be wrong, but for now, 
I'm hoping their exclusion is intentional.
