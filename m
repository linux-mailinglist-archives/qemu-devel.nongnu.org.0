  Yes, I would put that cpu value down to some fluctuation in the test

 Yes, the baseline speed for the fpu in Mac OS 9.2 is relatively low.

 new run 5.0 branch + hardfloat patches: cpu 184%, fpu 54%

It seems I misreported (copy/past without changing the values) the earlier
Windows-based results with Mac OS 9.2 guest. As said above (and this now
seems to confirm) Windows is not impressed at all and perhaps a bit slower
even.
Windows builds are particularly sensitive to any other activity on the
system. Moving the qemu window drops performance considerably. Perhaps due
to SDL not running in its own thread?

No virtualisation. I run all on the same bare metal, so booted into these
three separately from separate SSDs. You might guess OSX Sierra is running
on less "official" hardware and you would be right. All qemu builds were 64
bit.
