Yep, we don't even build the 32-bit CPUs for 64-bit.

I'm going to leave this config disabled and we can add a TODO of
fixing up riscv64-softmmu to support 32-bit and 64-bit.

Dynamically changing XLEN is then another can of worms. Although there
isn't much interest, it becomes more useful with the Hypervisor
extensions supporting 32-bit guests on 64-bit systems.
