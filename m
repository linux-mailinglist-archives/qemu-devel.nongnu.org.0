Because disabling a command is not the same as nonexistent command. 
While a command can be disabled by user/sysadmin, they are disabled at 
runtime by qemu-ga itself for a short period of time (e.g. on FS freeze 
some commands are disabled - typically those which require write disk 
access). And I guess reporting CommandNotFound for a command that does 
exist only is disabled temporarily doesn't reflect the reality, does it?

On the other hand, CommandNotFound would fix the issue for libvirt, so 
if you don't want to invent a new error class, then that's the way to go.
