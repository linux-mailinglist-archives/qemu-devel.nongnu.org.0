yes. this was a result of keeping the original patches #1 and #2, and=20
doing the cleanup on-top as separate patches. I missed folding it into=20
the first instead of (now combined) second patch.

I think it should be possible for this instance. for the other end of=20
the job, merging back happens before setting the bitmap to un-busy, so we=20
need to use _internal there. will add a comment for that one why we are=20
allowed to do so.
