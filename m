if you mean QMP, than it is possible to keep model there where
it already exists. Based on experiment [1](x86) I did, it's local to
affected target and doesn't pollute other code.

One way to get rid of them is to deprecate them in favor of strict
match (no fallback/substitutions/aliases) to typename and when we
drop it make switch type based naming only.

1) I've just took a quick look at how much of duplicated/confusing
code we could get rid off if we drop cpu_class_by_name/*_cpu_list.
It amounts to >800LOC of trivial removal (not counting ppc/s390
that depend on model naming heavily and in need of some non
trivial refactoring)
