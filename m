[1] This also implies that node names of the nodes where migration should
not transfer state must be unique on the both sides since you can't
control it otherwise.

This should then also be a moment to carefully think about the
semantics of migrating data for backends which don't need to be
identical on both sides of the migration for the VM to work correctly.

I think that any feature which touches backends should ideally be an
opt-in. This would call for a explicit action to use it which would also
allow management apps to consider expectations and implications of
enabling it rather than doing it automatically. One possibility would be
also to make it introspectable in such a way that it can be made opt-in
by disabling all unknown features programatically in the mgmt app.

In case of migration of bitmaps if node-names are going to be used for
the matching, it can have interresting consequences (such as matching
wrong ones if they don't match) and thus the feature should be used
knowingly.

Well it depends actually on what's happening. In some cases we use a
drive/blockdev-mirror to transfer the image if it's non-shared which
also by default flattens the backing chain. In such case you still might
want to transfer the bitmaps over and merge them during migration so
that backups can be taken despite the chain being flattened. In this
case we still want to use the bitmap on the destination with all new
changes merged in, but it must also allow the NBD server.

As I've said above, ideally anything like that will be an explicit
opt-in so that we can actually make sure that it's doing the right thing
if the user reconfigures the storage backends at the destination of
migration.

Well, without an explicit map the above cases (drop the bitmaps if the
destination does not have the corresponding image) become hard to tell
apart from failures. That will mean that any missing mapping will be
ignored and on any wrong configuration bitmaps just vanish rather than
reporting error.
