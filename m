Ok, I was just looking at Intel's x87 chip documentation. It supports =
IEEE 754 floating point operations and exception flags. This leads me to =
this question. Would simply taking the host exception flags and using =
them to set the PowerPC's FPU's flag be an acceptable solution to this =
problem?=20

These are the flags that all CPU's that support the IEEE 754 standard =
implement:=20
   - division by zero
   - inexact
   - overflow
   - underflow
   - invalid operation

This could be an API that is used to retrieve the host flags' value:
 - get_host_div_zero_flag()
 - get_host_inexact_flag()
 - get_host_overflow_flag()
 - get_host_underflow_flag()
 - get_host_invalid_oper_flag()

We could then use this API to set the PowerPC FPU exception flags.=20

Does this sound like a good solution?=20
