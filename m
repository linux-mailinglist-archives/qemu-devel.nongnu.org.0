Yes, this only breaks Author: if the patch is applied from the list.

Don't know much about DKIM but google seems to confirm what you say. So,
this means that patchew will complain each time you post if we can't find
a proper way to address that... :-\

I've received the patches in my mailbox but I prefer to use the patchwork's
pwclient CLI to apply patches... and patchwork captures the patches from
the list, so I end up having to patch the authorship manually anyway.

How are you sending patches ? With git send-email ? If so, maybe you can pass
something like --from='"Christian Schoenebeck" <qemu_oss@crudebyte.com>'.
Since this is a different string, git will assume you're sending someone else's
patch : it will automatically add an extra From: made out of the commit Author
as recorded in the git tree.

Prettier certainly but...

/* Same as mirror8bit() just for a 64 bit data type instead for a byte. */
static inline uint64_t mirror64bit(uint64_t value)
{
    return ((uint64_t)mirror8bit(value         & 0xff) << 56) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 8)  & 0xff) << 48) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 16) & 0xff) << 40) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 24) & 0xff) << 32) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 32) & 0xff) << 24) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 40) & 0xff) << 16) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 48) & 0xff) <<  8) |
           ((uint64_t)mirror8bit((value >> 56) & 0xff));
}

... is readable enough IMHO and makes checkpatch happy :)
