Well, using ${file}.in and ${file}.out has the advantage that it works
fine with all qemu versions.  So adding a warning suggesting to use that
makes sense to me, especially as 7.1 fix.

When looking at longer-term improvements it is probably better to add
support for explicit in/out pipe names, i.e. input= and output=
parameters as suggested later in the thread.  Avoids needing to know
qemu internals (pipe naming convention) and allows to make the input
pipe optional for the logging use case.  That probably is something we
don't want rush into 7.1 though ...

take care,
  Gerd
