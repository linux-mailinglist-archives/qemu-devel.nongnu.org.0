Thanks for the detailed explanation, Markus. I had to re-read this several times to
think about the different scenerios that could occur here.

From what you are saying above, my understanding is that the only thing that
.instance_init() should do is add properties, so I can see that this works fine for
value properties and MemoryRegions. How would this would for reference properties
such as gpios and links? Presumably these should be defined in .instance_init() but
not connected until .realize()?

If this is the case then how should object_property_add_alias() work since that not
only defines the property but also links to another object? qdev has a separate
concept of defining connectors vs. connecting them which feels like it would fit this
pattern.

I certainly understand now why sysbus_init_child_obj() is wrong. Is there any way to
detect this around object_new()/realize()? Perhaps take a snapshot of properties
after object_new(), the same again after realize() and then write a warning to stderr
if there are any differences? It would make issues like this more visible than they
would be in device-introspect-test.


ATB,

Mark.
