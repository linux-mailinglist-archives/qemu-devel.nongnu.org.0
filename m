I'd probably add a definitive article before "user application",
"vendor driver", etc. Not sure if it's too much churn.

"If set, bit 0 indicates _RUNNING state. If unset, it indicates _STOP
state. When the device is changed to _STOP state, the driver should
stop the device before write() returns."

"If set, bit 1 indicates _SAVING state. When it is set, the driver
should start to gather the device state information that will be
provided to the VFIO user application to save the device's state."

"If set, bit 2 indicates _RESUMING state. When it is set, the driver
should prepare to resume the device, using the data provided via the
migration region."

"In order to preserve them, the user application should use a
read-modify-write operation on the device_state field when modifying
the state."
