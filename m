Alright, with a d06 aarch64 machine I was able to reproduce it after 8
attempts.I'll debug it today and provide feedback on my findings.

Title:
  qemu-img hangs on high core count ARM system

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  On the HiSilicon D06 system - a 96 core NUMA arm64 box - qemu-img
  frequently hangs (~50% of the time) with this command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 /tmp/cloudimg /tmp/cloudimg2

  Where "cloudimg" is a standard qcow2 Ubuntu cloud image. This
  qcow2->qcow2 conversion happens to be something uvtool does every time
  it fetches images.

  Once hung, attaching gdb gives the following backtrace:
