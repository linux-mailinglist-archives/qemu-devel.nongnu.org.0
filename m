My preference would be 3 with the strings defined as being
%x lower case hex formated with a 0x prefix and no longer than 18 charact=
ers
("0x" + 16 nybbles). Zero padding allowed but not required.
It's readable and unambiguous when dealing with addresses; I don't want
to have to start decoding (2) by hand when debugging.
