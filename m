How would this work? Can you have an XCode project that just
says "to build this program we will run configure and make" ?
We definitely don't want to have two parallel mechanisms for
specifying how to build QEMU, because they'll just get out of sync.

My experience with homebrew has been pretty good overall.
If there's a better way to handle OSX hosts that doesn't
require us to carry around all our dependencies (which is
impractical) that would be interesting to investigate.

Lots of stuff is autogenerated, yes.
