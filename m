it allows  us to drop nodes_per_pkg calculation with its dependency on numa,
since it's provided by user with -smp dies=

We might need a sanity check that user provided value is valid in case on EPYC though.

There are several checks there and that includes validating per CPU node-id
values and workarounds for broken libvirt.

Where I'm talking more about number of numa nodes required f(-smp dies,-cpu EPYC),
like:
  if (dies>1 && epyc && nb_numa_nodes != sockets * dies)
     error_steg("chosen cpu model ... and -smp ... parameters require X numa nodes being configured")
     error_append_hint("use -numa options to create requred number of numa nodes")

I'm not sure where put it in for now, we can try to put it into x86_cpus_init()
for starters and later see if there is more sutable place for it.

numa_complete_configuration()
...
    if (ms->numa_state->num_nodes == 0 &&                                        
        ((ms->ram_slots && mc->auto_enable_numa_with_memhp) ||                   
         (ms->maxram_size > ms->ram_size && mc->auto_enable_numa_with_memdev) || 
         mc->auto_enable_numa)) {                                                
            NumaNodeOptions node = { };                                          
            parse_numa_node(ms, &node, &error_abort);                            
            numa_info[0].node_mem = ram_size;                                    
    }

that is a fragment that takes care of implict creation of the single numa node.
lets ignore *numa_with_* cases and look into mc->auto_enable_numa.
It is MachineClass field and we are not supposed to change it at runtime,
but we need to enable it in case options specify 1 node config, i.e.

  "-cpu epyc -smp x,sockets=1,dies=1"

so we need to trigger auto_enable_numa depending on above condition.
Looking at the current code there is no good place to put it in.

we can try to replace MachineClass::auto_enable_numa with callback
  bool MachineClass::auto_enable_numa_cb(MachineState *ms)
so we can change logic at runtime where it's needed.

that's where confusion in naming gets in a way:
let's set following difinitions for purpose of this discussion/QEMU
   node_id = system wide NUMA node id  
   AMD's ApicId[5:4] = die_id

what AMD encodes in APIC ID is not a node_id but reather an index of a node within package.
Even in spec in one place it's called "Node ID" but in another place it's reffered as DIE_ID.

Whith that cleared up, following CPUID defined as
CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX[7:0] = NodeId
but it's not the same as ApicId[5:4], description says it's {5'b00000,1'b[SOCKET_ID],2'b[DIE_ID]}.
and CPUID dump from EPYC machine confirms that. It also matches with system wide NUMA node ids
encoded in SRAT table.
So above pointed patch is incorrect wrt CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX.

Considering we allow for more nodes than existing EPYCs can have,
I'd rather it would take value of NUMA node id from CPU's "node-id" property
with a check that it fits within CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX[7:0] space at realize time,
to ensure that NUMA node ids are consistent with what user provides and ACPI tables.
