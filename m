Is the proposed patch backwards compatible (ie "old QEMU binary works
with newer binfmt-misc registration" and "new QEMU binary works with
older binfmt-misc registration") ? Because binfmt-misc stuff is whole-
system but QEMU binaries are per-chroot, this kind of thing is awkward
to change if we don't have back-compat (and typically the kernel
semantics for these things often don't allow back-compat or any kind of
migration-path to the new better setup :-( )

Title:
  qemu-user: $0 incorrectly always reports absolute path

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  We just ran into an issue with the Perl package on Debian/m68k when
  being built with qemu-user [1].

  The problem can be boiled down to qemu-user always reporting absolute
  paths for the shell variable $0 no matter on how the command was
  invoked.

  A simple reproducer is this:

  On normal system (no emulation):

  root@nofan:~> sh -c 'echo $0'
  sh
  root@nofan:~>

  On qemu-user:

  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/# sh -c 'echo $0'
  /bin/sh
  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/#
