The table of RMA limits based on the LPCR[RMLS] field is slightly wrong.
We're missing the RMLS =3D=3D 0 =3D> 256 GiB RMA option, which is availab=
le on
POWER8, so add that.

The comment that goes with the table is much more wrong.  We *don't* filt=
er
invalid RMLS values when writing the LPCR, and there's not really a
sensible way to do so.  Furthermore, while in theory the set of RMLS valu=
es
is implementation dependent, it seems in practice the same set has been
available since around POWER4+ up until POWER8, the last model which
supports RMLS at all.  So, correct that as well.
