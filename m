Having just the device impl doesn't cause any legal problems.

It does become a slight usability issue, as any users need to go and find
the suitable BIOS in order to use the device. No downstream OS vendors are
going to be able to distribute this BIOS either

I don't know if we have hit this problem before & if we have any
general policies about it ?
