If it were possible to drop an existing supported guest into secure VM
mode, that would make sense.  But AFAICT, a guest always need to be
aware of the secure mode - it certainly does on POWER.  Plus, support
for secure guest mode is way newer than support for modern virtio
devices.

Even then, I don't see that this is really anything new.  Updating
machine type version can absolutely change system devices in a way
which could break guests (though it mostly won't).  If you really want
stable support for a given guest, use a versioned machine type.  Doing
that will work just as well for the secure VM stuff as for anything
else.
