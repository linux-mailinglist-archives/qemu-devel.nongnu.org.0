Hello Daniel,

Ok, TigerVNC, added -shared=3D1 to behave the same=20
as TightVNC, works greatly, Thanks !

But funny thing, I saw you were part of exchanges=20
on that topic, noVNC totally fails now.
Despite my keyboard isnt changed, debian VM is=20
just in QWERTY as if noVNC only send keysyms.

If you know how to force noVNC keycodes instead, digging to find the trick=
 :-(

Thanks

Brgrds
