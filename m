>=20

Yes. The problem is that we now have a new path:

spapr_irq_init()
 spapr_irq_update_active_intc()
  set_active_intc()
   spapr_xive_activate()

and we go there before the CPUs are realized:

(gdb) p cpus
$6 =3D {tqh_first =3D 0x0, tqh_circ =3D {tql_next =3D 0x0,=20
    tql_prev =3D 0x100f203a8 <cpus>}}

spapr_xive_activate() thus doesn't reset the OS CAM line.

When the initial machine reset happens later, CPUs are
present but we don't go down the activate path since XIVE
is already active.

Commenting away the following check in set_active_intc() is enough
to fix:

    if (new_intc =3D=3D spapr->active_intc) {
        /* Nothing to do */
        return;
    }

but this also reveals that handling the OS CAM line reset in
spapr_xive_activate() only may be a bit fragile since it obviously
requires CPUs to be present... Maybe this should also be done by
the CPUs on their realize path ?
