Well, the device will produce a wakeup event for sure (unless it is
buggy), so the kernel will notice.  It might be that the kernel doesn't
forward the event to userspace though.

For "normal" usb applications the kernel can transparently handle
suspend+wakeup and just re-submit pending urbs to the hardware after
receiving a wakeup event, so powermanagement works automagically without
the app doing anything special.

For qemu + spice-client that approach doesn't work though, we need
explicit instead of automatic power management so we can properly
forward any events to the guest and let the guest deal with it.

Skimming the libusb docs it seems there is no support for that though.
So no easy way out.  Guess patching the descriptor is the best thing we
can do here.

Can you make a small series for both?  I guess the actual descriptor
checking and patching is pretty simliar and can be handled by a shared
helper function.

thanks,
  Gerd
