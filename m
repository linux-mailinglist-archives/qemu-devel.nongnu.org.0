I'm very pleased with how this series evolved over the time,
and Taylor interaction with the community during the long
review process.

Patches 1-34 are OK but I don't think patch 35 (Dockerfile hexagon)
should enter mainstream that way. It probably makes sense to add
it along with the CI testing job (missing so far).

Patch 30 (Linux user emulation) could have an Acked-by from Laurent.

Also, while having TCG unit tests is great, it doesn't replace
integration tests using real world binaries. So personally I'd
like to be able to test an Hexagon BusyBox, ideally one coming
from the official Hexagon distribution (extracted from the SDK).
We talked about this and Brian will probably share it.

Whole series tested it on x86, so:
Tested-by: Philippe Mathieu-Daud√© <f4bug@amsat.org>
(I still plan to test it on big-endian host)

Ahah I just suggested to Taylor to look at your previous explanation
before reading the same explanation here :)
