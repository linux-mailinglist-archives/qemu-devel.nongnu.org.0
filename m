Yes.

Non-zero exit. The float_convs and madds tests always pass but the
second phase is a diff with a reference output which may fails.
Whichever is easier for your test case.

OK - we certainly want to include tests for fixed functionality as we
add it. It's something we are trying to get better at since the big
re-write a few years ago.
