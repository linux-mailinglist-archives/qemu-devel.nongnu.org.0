I wasn't clear. I don't want an additional document but I'd like to
include information on the gdbstub in both the system and linux-user
manuals. Another candidate for documentation which is common to both
would be the notes about TCG CPU emulation.

In the case of the gdbstub the only real difference is the invocation
section (-s vs -g). I guess we could just reference both in the section.
It's not like the linux-user documents can't acknowledge the existence
of system emulation and visa-versa.
