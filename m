Er, that's what this patch is doing.

Yes, I think that would be a reasonable thing to do.
The implicit creation is weird since we effectively
rely on a main system bus existing anyway (it is the root
of the reset tree).

That might be nice, but in practice we have no such model at
all, and I don't think I've seen anybody propose one. I hope we
don't have too many accidental ordering dependencies, but I'm
not confident that we have none at all, and would prefer not to
prod that sleeping dragon...

The multi-phase-reset patches Damien has on list at the moment
would allow some of the reset ordering issues to be sidestepped
because "phase 1" for all devices happens before "phase 2" so
you have "before" and "after" places to put the logic in different
devices.

Most of the ones for hardware are "this device hasn't been
converted to be a QOM Device" (eg hw/arm/omap1.c, hw/input/pckbd.c,
lots of the stuff in hw/ppc).

The other reason for having to have a qemu_register_reset() handler
to reset something that's a Device is if that Device is not on
a qbus. The most common example of this is CPUs -- since those
don't have a bus to live on they don't get reset by the "reset
everything that's on a QOM bus reachable from the main system
bus" logic. I'm not sure what the nicest way to address this is:
transitioning away from "reset of devices is based on the qdev tree"
to something else seems between difficult and impossible, even
though logically speaking the QOM tree is in many cases closer
to the actual hardware hierarchy of reset.

I guess so... (There's an argument that the main system bus
should be a child bus of the Machine object, logically speaking,
but Machines aren't subtypes of Device so that doesn't work.)

You're right, the bus_unparent() logic should also be cleaned up.
