Hi Alex/Emilio,

I am really happy to see the progress you made on the plugin feature. Looki=
ng
forward to seeing it merged soon! Please CC me on future versions of the
patchset. I am happy to help review and contribute to this effort.

I have a few general comments from experience writing a very similar system
(qsim) below.

* Register and memory read/write API

  It would be great to have register and memory read/write API i.e., abilit=
y
  to read/write to registers/memory from within the callback. This gives th=
e
  plugin ability to do system introspection. (Not sure if the current patch=
set
  implements this already).

* Register callbacks

  A callback needs to be invoked whenever a specified registers is read or
  written to.

* Where do new plugins live in the tree?

  The current source files in plugins (api, core etc.,) I think are better =
if
  moved to tcg/plugins/.  The various plugins we write would then live in t=
he
  plugins/ folder instead of the current tests/plugin/ folder.

* Timer interrupts

  What I observed is that the system execution is affected by what you do i=
n
  the callbacks because of timer interrupts. For example, if you spend time=
 in
  the memory callback doing a bit of processing and writing to a file, you
  will see more timer interrupt instructions. One solution to this would be=
 to
  use 'icount', but it does not work that well. I think we need to do
  something similar to what gdb does in debug mode. How would you handle MT=
TCG
  guests in that case?

  Another approach would be to offload callback generation to a separate
  plugin thread. The main thread will copy data required by a callback and
  invoke the callback asynchronously (std::async in C++ if you are familiar=
).

* Starting and stopping callback generation

  It would be great if we have a mechanism to dynamically start/stop callba=
cks
  when a sequence of code (magic instruction) is executed. This would be
  useful to annotate region-of-interest (ROI) in benchmarks to
generate callbacks.

  Also, the return value from a callback can be used to decide further cour=
se
  of action. For example, if our plugin needs 10000 callbacks, it can indic=
ate
  to stop generating further callbacks in the return value of the callback
  once it got the necessary callbacks.

* State saving API

  An API to save the state of the VM from the plugin code.

Let me know your thoughts and any other ideas you might have.

Thanks,
--
Pranith
