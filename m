Fair enough, it's usually code that touches block code. I assumed "block
patches" to mean patches that go through one of the block trees and for
which iotests are run before sending a pull request.

In the end, I don't care what code these patches touched. I do an
innocent git pull, and when I finally see that it's master that breaks
iotests and not my patches on top of it, I'm annoyed.

Ah, we can also play this game the other way round.

So if you merge that revert, when iotests break in master, I take it I
can rely on you to fix it up before it impacts my working branch?

Yes, making iotests stable on CI probably involves some pain, especially
initially. However, if we don't fix them upstream, they'll end up on our
desk again downstream because people run tests neither on your nor on my
laptop.

I think we might actually save time by fixing them once and for all,
even if they are problems in the test cases and not in QEMU, and making
new test cases portable from the start, instead of getting individual
reports one at a time and having to look at the same test cases again
and again.
