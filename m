Shouldn't be a problem, as query-cpu-model-expansion
documentation already advises against using "-cpu" when calling
it.

I don't mean changing the command line interface, but just
changing the implementation of "+foo" and "-foo".

In theory the code was already fixed to make this safe, but I
agree this might be tricky.  Let's worry about
plus_features/minus_features later.

If named CPU models are already consistent, ignoring
user_features shouldn't make a difference, right?  It would also
be a useful mechanism to detect inconsistencies in internal CPU
model definitions.

I don't understand why the user_features check would be necessary
to make "-cpu host,-rdtscp" work.

I don't get it.  It looks like you only need env->user_features
to be set above because you are handling dependencies before
cpu->max_features is handled.

If you handle dependencies at x86_cpu_filter_features() instead
(after cpu->max_features was already handled), you don't even
need to worry about setting user_features.
