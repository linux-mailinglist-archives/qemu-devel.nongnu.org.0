Paolo, I'm not sure if I properly understand it yet but I don't see any
specific requirements on PDPTE's reset. SDM says that it should be valid
only if PAE is used as documented in 26.3.1.6 Checks on Guest
Page-Directory-Pointer-Table Entries:
 "A VM entry to a guest that does not use PAE paging does not check the
 validity of any PDPTEs.

 A VM entry that checks the validity of the PDPTEs uses the same checks
 that are used when CR3 is loaded with MOV to CR3 when PAE paging is in
 use. If MOV to CR3 would cause a general-protection exception due to
 the PDPTEs that would be loaded (e.g., because a reserved bit is set),
 the VM entry fails."

That means we can drop PDPTE initialization in hv_vcpu_reset() as well.
Perhaps, I can try that and check if Windows XP with PAE support works
well alright across resets. macvm_set_cr0() takes care of setting PDPTEs
upon the entry into PAE mode.

Regards,
Roman
