This close to the release, minimal bug fix now and cleanup later makes
lots of sense.

This one, in pflash_write()?

    switch (pfl->wcycle) {
    case 0:
        ...
--->    case 0xff: /* Read array mode */
            DPRINTF("%s: Read array mode\n", __func__);
            goto reset_flash;
        ...
    }
    return;
    ...
 reset_flash:
    trace_pflash_reset();
    memory_region_rom_device_set_romd(&pfl->mem, true);
    pfl->wcycle =3D 0;
    pfl->cmd =3D 0;

I can't see a warning here.

Let's ignore the tracepoint.

Is the memory_region_rom_device_set_romd() appropriate for READ_ARRAY?

pfl->wcycle =3D 0 is a no-op.

pfl->cmd =3D 0 is part of the "use 0 instead 0f 0xFF to represent
READ_ARRAY state" madness.

By the way, use of tracing and DPRINTF() in the same .c is an
anti-pattern.  Care to convert the remaining DPRINTF() into tracepoints?
Feel free to delete useless ones, if any.

Feels like a latent bug.  Adding timing turns it into a real one.

If it's a bug fix, have the commit message explain the bug.

If it's just cleanup, heave the commit message say so.

Good.

Uh, isn't "[in New] before this patch" is a contradiction?

Old =3D QEMU before this patch
New =3D QEMU with this patch applied

New -> old -> new =3D migrate from QEMU with the patch to QEMU without the
patch, then migrate again to QEMU with the patch.

If @cmd can be 0x00 initially, then the first migration is (5), and @cmd
remains 0x00.  The second migration is (2), and @cmd becomes 0xFF.  The
two migrations together change device state, which could be bad.

I'm afraid you gave a different answer to the same question above:
"Yes :(".

The part I actually understand here is "this device model is wrong in so
many ways".

Is this device model fixable with reasonable effort?
