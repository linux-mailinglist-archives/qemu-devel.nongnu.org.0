When initializing the LUKS header the size with default encryption
parameters will currently be 2068480 bytes. This is rounded up to
a multiple of the cluster size, 2081792, with 64k sectors. If the
end of the header is not the same as the end of the cluster we fill
the extra space with zeros. This was forgetting that not even the
space allocated for the header will be fully initialized, as we
only write key material for the first key slot. The space left
for the other 7 slots is never written to.

An optimization to the ref count checking code:

  commit a5fff8d4b4d928311a5005efa12d0991fe3b66f9 (refs/bisect/bad)
  Author: Vladimir Sementsov-Ogievskiy <vsementsov@virtuozzo.com>
  Date:   Wed Feb 27 16:14:30 2019 +0300

    qcow2-refcount: avoid eating RAM

made the assumption that every cluster which was allocated would
have at least some data written to it. This was violated by way
the LUKS header is only partially written, with much space simply
reserved for future use.

Depending on the cluster size this problem was masked by the
logic which wrote zeros between the end of the LUKS header and
the end of the cluster.

$ qemu-img create --object secret,id=3Dcluster_encrypt0,data=3D123456 \
   -f qcow2 -o cluster_size=3D2k,encrypt.iter-time=3D1,\
               encrypt.format=3Dluks,encrypt.key-secret=3Dcluster_encrypt0 =

1 errors were found on the image.
Data may be corrupted, or further writes to the image may corrupt it.

127 leaked clusters were found on the image.
This means waste of disk space, but no harm to data.
Image end offset: 268288

The problem only exists when the disk image is entirely empty. Writing
data to the disk image payload will solve the problem by causing the
end of the file to be extended further.

The change fixes it by ensuring that the entire allocated LUKS header
region is fully initialized with zeros. The qemu-img check will still
fail for any pre-existing disk images created prior to this change,
unless at least 1 byte of the payload is written to.

Fully writing zeros to the entire LUKS header is a good idea regardless
as it ensures that space has been allocated on the host filesystem (or
whatever block storage backend is used).
