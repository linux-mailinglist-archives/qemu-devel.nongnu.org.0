This appears to me the same case as a user downloading a proprietary=20
driver/firmware at some vendor website, accepting the EULA, then using=20
the driver within a QEMU VM.

No close source blob are redistributed, but users can still run them,=20
and both party (the QEMU project, and the users) are legally correct,=20
right? But IANAL.
