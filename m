As Dave pointed out, they're both lengths, but VQ specifically points
out that the unit is 'Q'uadwords. We could use VQS instead of VLS,
"Vector Lengths" sounds better.

I'm fine with that if nobody else objects.

OK, and then with a flag stating which is when then. Dave points out
we may want to reduce the list to a single set and then add flags
to indicate what can be done with it in order to derive other sets.
What do you think about that?

If we eventually need more than one word for the bitmap then it'll
require parsing and bitmap composition code in libvirt anyway. I
was thinking by pointing out each bit separately that we could
boundlessly grow the list without having to change anything in
libvirt later.
