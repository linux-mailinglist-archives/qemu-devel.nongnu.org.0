It doesn't feel very compelling to have just 1 source file that's
C++ in QEMU. I'm curious how we ended up with this nanomips.cpp
file - perhaps it originated from another project that was C++
based ?

The code itself doesn't look like it especially needs to be using
C++. There's just 1 class there and every method is associated
with that class, and external entry point from the rest of QEMU
is just one boring method. Feels like it could easily have been
done in C.

Personally I'd prefer it to be converted to C, and if we want to
add any C++ in future it should be justified & debated on its
merits, rather than as an artifact of any historical artifacts
such as the code in configure happening to still exist.

With regards,
Daniel
