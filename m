The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  OS started to crash with a message: "Trying to execute code outside
  RAM or ROM"

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  There is a project (https://github.com/narke/colorForth ) wich always
  worked with qemu up to version 2.5.1.1 but doesn't works from version
  2.6 onwards. It continues to work with bochs.

  Downlaod: git clone https://github.com/narke/colorForth.git
  Build: make
  Test: qemu-system-i386 -drive format=3Draw,file=3Dcf2012.img,index=3D0,if=
=3Dfloppy

  =

  System information: Ubuntu LTS 16.04 x86-64
  Affected qemu versions: 2.6 to present (2.8)

  =

  I got the message:

  =

  WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'cf2012.img' and probing gues=
sed raw.
           Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, =
write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
           Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.
  qemu-system-i386: Trying to execute code outside RAM or ROM at 0x8998c426
  This usually means one of the following happened:

  (1) You told QEMU to execute a kernel for the wrong machine type, and it =
crashed on startup (eg trying to run a raspberry pi kernel on a versatilepb=
 QEMU machine)
  (2) You didn't give QEMU a kernel or BIOS filename at all, and QEMU execu=
ted a ROM full of no-op instructions until it fell off the end
  (3) Your guest kernel has a bug and crashed by jumping off into nowhere

  This is almost always one of the first two, so check your command line an=
d that you are using the right type of kernel for this machine.
  If you think option (3) is likely then you can try debugging your guest w=
ith the -d debug options; in particular -d guest_errors will cause the log =
to include a dump of the guest register state at this point.

  Execution cannot continue; stopping here.

  Thank you in advance.
