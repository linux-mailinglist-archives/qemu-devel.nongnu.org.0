It's still considered, but I didn't have time to implement anything
related to it and nobody else implemented it either.

Additionally the problem isn't in libvirt's handling but more in other
apps handling. We still due to historical reasons support if users
create overlays outside of libvirt.

This would mean that either backups break if the overlay is not done
properly or we have to have a fallback to use
'block-dirty-bitmap-populate'. At this point for both my sanity and
actually finishing all the details in regards to incremental backup

So, this is advantage of creating bitmap over relaying on block-status capturing by block-dirty-bitmap-populate: you don't control dirtiness granularity. So, I think that bitmap propagation, or just creating new dirty bitmap to track dirtiness from start of new snapshot is better.

You mean like we do now?:

https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/blob/master/src/qemu/qemu_driver.c#L15020

That is slated to be deleted with my patchset though.

Good thing is that we can theoretically re-add it later.

For now I'd go with the simpler option that has fewer side effects.

> Isn't it simpler than to just use existing block-status-bitmap, than run a job?

No. Because we'd still need to support cases where user added an overlay
without the appropriate bitmap. As said I'd prefer to keep the code
simple and then work on optimizations. Good thing is that with 'one
active bitmap per point in time' this is simpler to achieve.

> Hmm, if the main use case of populating job is to merge changes since snapshot to several bitmaps (all active bitmaps?), than I think it's correct to implement exactly this semantics, allowing a list of targets as well as list of source bitmaps. We even can reuse same structure for target-list which we use for source-list. And it's simple to implement in Qemu.

I'd mainly like for the design to converge. I actually have almost
complete patches which use the current semantics. I'm okay with
reworking it but at some point there should be a line when it won't
change.
