I mean that we call the current virt machine the virt machine for QEMU
7.1. Then for future releases we can make breaking changes, where we
have the old 7.1 virt machine for backwards compatibility.

Yeah, so I guess this doesn't achieve the same outcome you want. I
would say we would still include some MMIO devices, like UART for
example.

But we could simplify things a bit. So for example maybe we could use
AIA by default and then remove the PLIC code. That would help cleanup
the board file. Then we could add a `msi-only` option that would be
similar to https://github.com/atishp04/qemu/commit/d7fc1c6aa7855b414b348467=
2a076140166a2dcd.
But without the PLIC it should hopefully be cleaner

We would need AIA ratified before we could remove the PLIC though.

That's true, but I think we are going to have this issue someday
anyway. We don't want to use the SiFive CLINT and PLIC forever,
eventually we will want to use the newer hardware.

I'm on board with these! They would all be great to have.

I'm open to a virt-pcie, but as others have pointed out it might be
easier to just make the switch now to the general board.

I don't see this being achievable unfortunately
