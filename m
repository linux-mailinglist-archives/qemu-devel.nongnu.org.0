Well, this may answer my question in

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1d6b1894-9c45-2d70-abde-9c10c1b3b93f@linaro.org/

as to how this could occur.

Until relatively recently, TCG would refuse to execute out of MMIO *at all*.  This was 
relaxed to support Arm m-profile, which needs to execute a few instructions out of MMIO 
during the boot process, before jumping into flash.

This works by reading one instruction, translating it, executing it, and immediately 
discarding the translation.  It could be possible to adjust the translator to allow the 
second half of an instruction to be in MMIO, such that we execute and discard, however...

What is it about CXL that requires modeling with MMIO?  If it is intended to be used 
interchangeably with RAM by the guest, then you really won't like the performance you will 
see with TCG executing out of these regions.

Could memory across the CXL link be modeled as a ROM device, similar to flash?  This does 
not have the same restrictions as MMIO.
