I would further say that maintaining infrastructure is not a good use
of our contributors' time. It is better to have our contributors spend
time delivering features that are beneficial to our users, rather than
playing at sysadmin.

When I was thinking about this for libvirt I came to better understand
the appeal of the gitforge for project infrastructure. I've written
about it in detail for libvirt:

   https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2020-March/msg00009.html

The distributed SCM model of git democratized access to source control
features across contributors. Drive-by contributors have the same level
of SCM features as the main project contributors, instead of being
second class citizens as they are with a non-distributed SCM.

With the hosted Git forges, this concept covers all aspects of project
infrastructure. If your project is using GitLab for all its infra
needs, then when a user forks the repo they get access to all the
same features as the main project. The fork is no longer a second
class citizen lacking access to certain parts of the infra. I find
this is especially compelling in the area of CI, containers and web
hosting.

Consider if qemu-web.git is hosted on gitlab, using GitLab CI to
generate the static site content, and GitLab pages to host the
website. If a user wants to contribute to qemu-web, they can fork
the repo and be confident that the CI jobs in their fork are going
to work in the exact same way as in the master repo. They can use
GitLab Pages to browse the generated content for their fork to
see exactly how it will look.

This eliminates the big pain point in qemu-web contribution. Many
times I was tripped up with the problem of qemu-web.git requiring
a version of Jekyll that is incompatible with the version that
ships on my distro.

The CI integration has probably been the single best thing about
libvirt's switch to GitLab.

NB self-hosting would reduce features compared to gitlab.com unless
you paid for the enterprise edition. You'd also have to bring your
own infra for running CI jobs which quickly gets very expensive
as freedesktop.org admins have learnt the hard way. The CI resources
provided by gitlab.com are incredibly generous.

This is an easy win. it should be especially simple for qemu, compared to
libvirt, since qemu.org already used separate sub-domains for other content
like git & downloads.

Yeah, this is a potentially big piece of work. We didn't finish this
in libvirt either. Looking at the libvirt mediawiki though, I decided
not todo a straight export/import of all content.

A bunch of content was horribly out of date and needed deleting as
it was irrelevant to anyone, or outright misleading wrt current state
of the world.

A lot of content on the wiki really only existed in the wiki, because
contributing to our libvirt.org website was harder than it needed to
be. We switched the main website over to use RST instead of HTML so
authoring content is much closer to what you'd experience with the
wiki markup. The wiki became a burden for contributors as due to
spam attacks we can't allow anonymous access, and need manual account
creation as with QEMU wiki.

Every page on the main website now has a link "edit this page"
that takes you straight to the source file in the gitlab.com UI,
where you can interactively edit the text in your fork and then
submit a merge request with the result.

The wiki also suffered from the content not having any level of review.
While the intentions of many contributors were good, the results often
left alot to be desired.=20

So overall we decided that while GitLab does offer a wiki, we are not
intending to use it. Instead we're going to aim to turn the subset of
wiki content that is genuinely useful into pages on the main website.

IOW, I'd encourage whoever tackles the wiki to look at the content
with a critical eye and decide whether it really belongs in the wiki
at all. Considering:

  https://wiki.qemu.org/index.php?title=3DSpecial:AllPages

The Planning / Changes pages for each release are probably reasonable
as wiki pages.

The Interships/ProjectIdeas pages would possibly be better off as
GitLab Issue tickets, tagged with a "interships" label. That way
when a project starts you can have the issue to track the work
right from the start.

The Documentation/Platforms content arguably should be part of
the main qemu.git docs.

Many of the feature pages are probably better as part of the formal
QEMU documentation too.

With libvirt we had long used both gitlab.com/libvirt and github.com/libvir=
t
as read-only mirrors of the master libvirt.org/git/ repos.  When we formall=
y
adopted gitlab as primary infrastructure, we simply flipped the mirroring
processes around. So now libvirt.org/git is a read-only mirror, and gitlab
is the master.  Gitlab has built-in support to push to github.com as a
mirror which is useful.

So turning git.qemu.org into a readonly mirror would ease the transition
to avoid breaking any scripts / workflows relying on that URL in the short
term.

The big thing that always bothers me about launchpad is how easy it
is to get confused between issues for QEMU upstream and issues for
legacy releases in Ubuntu distro. This is the curse of using a distro
issue tracker - libvirt had the same problem with its use of Red Hat
bugzilla.

Integrated issue tracking alongside the primary git repo makes a lot
of sense. Once you declare gitlab.com the primary repo, contributors
will immediately look to gitlab for the issue tracking too whether
you tell them to or not.=20

The gitlab issue tracker is fairly simple especially compared to the
complexity horror of red hat bugzilla, so it was a massive win for
libvirt to switch away from bugzilla for issues. Probably not such
a big difference compared to launchpad in terms of complexity. The
little things though like magic git commit messages to close issues
are nice though.

There is a question of what todo with existing bugs in launchpad.

Essentially three choices

 1. Move all the open bugs to gitlab
 2. Move some relevant bugs to gitlab, but close outdated ones
 3. Leave existing launchpad bugs but don't allow new ones filed

So far for libvirt we did option 3 there, with a little bit of
option 2.

The experiance of moving infra to gitlab.com has been quite positive
for libvirt, and me in particular as the single point of failure for
much of libvirt's old infrastructure. I think it will be beneficial
for QEMU too, for many of the reasons I mention above and in the
email link I quoted.
