Thank you for working on this. It is about time we have a better FPU.=20

I applied your patch over David Gibson's ppc-for-5.0 branch. It applied =
cleanly and compiled easily.

Tests were done on a Mac OS 10.4.3 VM. The CPU was set to G3.=20

I did several tests and here are my results:

With hard float:
- The USB audio device does not produce any sound.=20
- Converting a MIDI file to AAC in iTunes happens at 0.4x (faster than =
soft float :) ).
For my FPSCR test program, 21 tests failed. The high number is because =
the inexact exception is being set for situations it should not be set =
for.

With soft float:
- Some sound can be heard from the USB audio device. It isn't good =
sounding. I had to force quit Quicktime player because it stopped =
working.
- Converting a MIDI file to AAC in iTunes happens at 0.3x (slower than =
hard float).
- 13 tests failed with my FPSCR test program.

This patch is a good start. I'm not worried about the Floating Point =
Status and Control Register flags being wrong since hardly any software =
bothers to check them. I think more optimizations can happen by =
simplifying the FPU. As it is now it makes a lot of calls per operation.
