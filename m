A goal of this patch in particular is the clean separation of the CLI 
frontend from the implementation logic behind it, such that you have:

(1) The CLI parsing, and
(2) A function implementing a task the package is capable of performing

The CLI parsing method converts sys.argv arguments into function 
parameter data that can be acted upon by another function in the package.

If checks are exclusive to the process of converting flags to argument 
data, they should stay in the CLI parsing function.

If checks prevent you from passing bad data lower into the program, I 
prefer pushing that check lower into the stack instead, such that the 
module is equivalently useful without the CLI frontend.

This conceptualization might be different from how you perceive QAPI. In 
my case, I consider the public functions and modules themselves to be 
interface that should behave reasonably and with some defensiveness. You 
might only count the CLI script itself in that category.

In this case, the prefix is passed to many different generators, so it 
seems good to check it before we hand it off to all those different places.

You don't like the loss of precision that causes for the CLI frontend 
error, which is reasonable.

I consider the function interface and the CLI frontend "equivalent", and 
so I found it odd to reject bad data in one, but not the other. IOW, I 
do not consider the CLI frontend the only user of generate().

I think it's minor in this case, sure. I am fine with saying "A valid 
prefix is a precondition", but then I want to document and enforce that 
precondition -- so I did wind up using an assert in my pending respin.
