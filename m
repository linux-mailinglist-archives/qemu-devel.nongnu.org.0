Why is it okay to change backing-filename incompatibly, but not
backing-filename-format? I would find it much more consistent if
ImageInfo reported the value from the header in both fields, and
BlockDeviceInfo reported the values actually in use.

The QAPI schema described ImageInfo as "Information about a QEMU image
file" and runtime state really isn't information about an image file.

If you want to know the probed image format, you can still look at
backing-image.format. I don't think this change is much different from
what you described above for BlockDeviceInfo.backing_file.
