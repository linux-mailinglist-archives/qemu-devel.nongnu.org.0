This seems a bit messy to me. With an EL3 firmware, the DTB is provided
by the EL3 firmware. I guess that's why when I look at the DTB generation
in virt.c we don't properly set "enable-method" of the CPUs to
"spin-table", even though we don't set it to "psci"[*]. However, if the
EL3 firmware isn't providing the ACPI tables too, then how do the DTB
and ACPI tables stay in synch? We can't be sure that just because we
have (vms->secure && firmware_loaded) that we should / should not
generate certain ACPI table entries when we don't also know what the
corresponding DTB will be.

So, I think the EL3 firmware should also provide the ACPI tables.
However, this patch it probably fine too. For a configuration where
the EL3 firmware provides the ACPI tables, it will do no harm. For
configurations where EL3 firmware isn't involved, it will do no harm.
And, for configurations like this, which I consider a bit hacky, it's
probably better to assume PSCI than not.

Thanks,
drew

[*] kernel doc Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/cpus.yaml says
    "enable-method" must be "spin-table" or "psci"
