As described in the included documentation, the "custom runner" jobs
extend the GitLab CI jobs already in place.  One of their primary
goals of catching and preventing regressions on a wider number of host
systems than the ones provided by GitLab's shared runners.

This sets the stage in which other community members can add their own
machine configuration documentation/scripts, and accompanying job
definitions.  As a general rule, those newly added contributed jobs
should run as "non-gating", until their reliability is verified (AKA
"allow_failure: true").

+
+Jobs on Custom Runners
+======================
+
+Besides the jobs run under the various CI systems listed before, there
+are a number additional jobs that will run before an actual merge.
+These use the same GitLab CI's service/framework already used for all
+other GitLab based CI jobs, but rely on additional systems, not the
+ones provided by GitLab as "shared runners".
+
+The architecture of GitLab's CI service allows different machines to
+be set up with GitLab's "agent", called gitlab-runner, which will take
+care of running jobs created by events such as a push to a branch.
+Here, the combination of a machine, properly configured with GitLab's
+gitlab-runner, is called a "custom runner".
+
+The GitLab CI jobs definition for the custom runners are located under::
+
+  .gitlab-ci.d/custom-runners.yml
+
+Custom runners entail custom machines.  To see a list of the machines
+currently deployed in the QEMU GitLab CI and their maintainers, please
+refer to the QEMU `wiki <https://wiki.qemu.org/AdminContacts>`__.
