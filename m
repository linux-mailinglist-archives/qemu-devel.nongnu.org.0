It sounds like maybe these disks have been partitioned in a format that
only Windows understands. Can you tell me what the windows disk manager
claims the partition table format to be?

If you still think that maybe there's a QEMU bug, please give more
details:

- host kernel version

- qemu version

- qemu command line

- how were these qcow2 files created?

- What version of qcow2 file does `qemu-img info` say they are?

- What version of windows? (10?)

- Can you name one of the third party disk managers so we can try to
reproduce it?

Title:
  empty qcow2

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I plugged multiple qcow2 to a Windows guest. On the Windows disk
  manager all disks are listed perfectly, with their data, their real
  space, I even can explore all files on the Explorer, all cool

  On third party disk manager (all of them), I only have the C:\ HDD who
  act normally, all the other plugged qcow2 are seen as fully
  unallocated, so I can't manipulate them

  I want to move some partitions, create others, but on Windows disk
  manager I can't extend or create partition and on third party I didn't
  see the partitions at all

  Even guestfs doesn't recognize any partition table `libguestfs: error:
  inspect_os: /dev/sda: not a partitioned device`
