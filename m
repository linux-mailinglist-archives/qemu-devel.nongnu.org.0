The QEMU python modules are not like other python modules though,
precisely because they are talking to QEMU. If we are shipping
QEMU python releases on the same schedule as QEMU, then we can
expect the normal ase to be updating both QEMU & Python together.
So regardless of versioning in the python code, the QMP code they
are talking to is liable to have removed deprecated features they
are using.  IMHO the upgrade issue is largely a problem of docs
and testing, semver is no magic bullet.

Daniel
