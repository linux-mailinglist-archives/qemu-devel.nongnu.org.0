Since it's ACPI oriented oriented, it's supposed to be little-endian.
But spec doesn't mention it and apparently code I wrote back then
have bugs in this regard.

The apology is all mine. I should've written better spec/code.
I'll fix it and update spec/code to match expected byte-order.

As for a way to enumerate CPUs an APIC ID, I've just posted patches
updating spec with example workflows and exposing APIC ID
in the interface.

  [RFC 0/3] acpi: cphp: add CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD command to cpu hotplug  MMIO interface
