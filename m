Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker. Top-posting for once,
to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Was there some progress to get this regression resolved? From here it
looks stalled, but maybe I missed something.

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I deal with a lot of
reports and sometimes miss something important when writing mails like
this. If that's the case here, don't hesitate to tell me in a public
reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record straight.
