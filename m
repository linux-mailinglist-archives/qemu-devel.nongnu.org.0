Aren't there pages written by the BIOS that are read by the system as it
comes up through reset - so you need those pages intact?
(But I don't think that slot gets removed? Or does it - the bios has
some weird aliasing)

Why doesn't that work with dirty ring?

I'm still unusure when slot removal happens for real; but if it's
happening for RAM on PCI devices, then that would make sense as
something you might want to keep.
