The same way as current commands, including job commands.

Using job API means providing new (& more complex) APIs to client.

The screendump fix here doesn't need new API, it needs new internal
dispatch of QMP commands: the purpose of this series.

Whenever we can solve things on qemu side, I would rather not
deprecate current API.

It blocks many things since the BQL is taken.

The goal is not to improve responsiveness at this point, but to fix
the QXL screendump bug, by introducing a split dispatch in QMP
commands: callback for starting, and a separate return function. This
is not rocket science. See below.

Agree, from cover letter:
Existing qemu commands can be gradually replaced by async:true
variants when needed, while carefully reviewing the concurrency
aspects.

It's a no-go to me, you don't want to teach all users out there with
new job API for existing commands when you can improve or fix things
in QEMU.

The QEMU change for the command can't really be simpler than what I
propose. You go from:

qmp_foo() {
  // do foo synchronously and
  return something
}

to:

qmp_foo_async(QmpReturn *r) {
  // do foo asynchronously (or return synchronously)
}

foo_done() {
  qmp_foo_async_return(r, something)
}

See "scripts: learn 'async' qapi commands" for the details.
