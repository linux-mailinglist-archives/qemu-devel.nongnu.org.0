Hmm...  The comment says that all nodes that disappear must be blocked.

I suppose we should start at the first explicit node, filter or not...?

I do.  It=E2=80=99s in s->parent.  I thought it makes sense to change the=

Would bdrv_backing_chain_next() fulfill the same purpose?  It can=E2=80=99=

allocated in a filter node, after all.

Sounds reasonable.  We can ignore all the filters on top of the
(un)filtered top anyway.

Hm, yes, we should probably check both (separately to give better error
messages).

In theory it might be possible to allow filters on top, but there isn=E2=80=
=99t
really any point.  If someone wants to add filters on top of the
snapshot, they should use reopen.

I can very much relate. :-)

Your review definitely is much appreciated.

Well.  I=E2=80=99m not really considerate of other patches with this seri=
es.
Rebasing is always such a pain that I just write it for the current
master.  I won=E2=80=99t incorporate unmerged series because doing so may=
 cause
me to have to rebase more than once.

And I can=E2=80=99t get this series merged soon enough because it=E2=80=99=
s just wrong
that I (and you) have to the one(s) thinking about how to treat filters
everywhere.  It should be the people that introduce the code.

Hm...  Isn=E2=80=99t that just a problem with the current documentation?

I think this change in code better fits what I=E2=80=99d guess from =E2=80=
=9Creachable=E2=80=9D
than what it currently means.

why would you do that

More serious, well, perhaps, in theory.  In practice I really cannot
imagine why it would be.

As said in the other subthread, I think ignoring filters here is fine.
