Ah, very good, you already mentioned the main points I had, and more. (I
didn't realise that using BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED is actually wrong, just
that it's more complicated than necessary.)

What I would like to add is that a bdrv_co_is_zero_fast() would be even
better. is_zero_cow() isn't marked as such yet, but semantically it's a
coroutine_fn, so we have no reason to go through the synchronous
wrappers.

This makes sense to me, though it should be a separate patch. This one
wouldn't become incorrect without it, but it would be less effective.
