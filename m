Title:
  -device ide-hd will assign bus with with no free units

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Originally filed here:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1000118

  ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -device ahci -drive id=3Daa,file=3D/t=
mp/foo,if=3Dnone -drive id=3Dbb,file=3D/tmp/foo,if=3Dnone -device ide-hd,dr=
ive=3Daa -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Can't create IDE unit 1, b=
us supports only 1 units
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Device initialization fail=
ed.
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Device 'ide-hd' could not =
be initialized

  If a bus isn't specified for -device ide-hd, it just uses the first
  bus it finds, not taking into account if that bus was already assigned
  for another device. So users are forced to do -device ide-hd,bus=3Dide.0
  -device ide-hd,bus=3Dide.1, etc.

  This isn't specific to -device ahci, but it's worse there since there
  isn't any -drive if=3DIDE or -hda convenience option, which both seem to
  get the logic correct.

  I know -device is the 'build it yourself' approach so I understand if
  this is WONTFIX.

  This is affects qemu.git as of today (8-31-2013)
