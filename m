I think, more concretely, the issues here are:

* The only mention of "semihosting" in the RISC-V specification is in the
  commentary, which is not considered a normative part of the specification.
* The interface that commentary contains is defined as maybe being obsolete
  already, but no new concrete interface is defined.
* The semihosting comment doesn't define the semihosting call numbers, just the
  sequence to get to a call.  That said, we haven't written down the Linux ABI
  either -- though there's a much larger breadth of software out there that
  implements it and won't break ABI compatibility, so maybe that's considered
  sufficient in Linux land where it's not for semihosting.

It seems to me like the right way to go forward is to put together a
semihosting ABI specification as a RISC-V specification.  That would give
everyone who cares about their pre-specification implementations a chance to
get together to figure out which parts they want to keep, and give us a path to
move forwards.  There's more work that needs to be done here to put together a
system that will actually work (for example, how to we insert breakpoints if
we're using ebreak to indicate semihosting and haven't reserved NOP
sequences?), so this does warrant a bit of thought.

I know it's a bit of a headache in the short term to get a specification
together, but we've had so many headaches of the "there's no spec" sort that at
least it'll be a change of pace :)
