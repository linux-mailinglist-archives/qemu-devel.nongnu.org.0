gist of discussion in this case is that:

bamboo HW supports 4 banks of RAM that could be populated by
256/128/64/32/16/8Mb DIMMs

so -m XXX must be multiple of that, otherwise we are not
able distribute all -m specified size between supported banks.

Current patch then would error out with
  "Max 4 banks of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 MB DIMM/bank supported"
  "Possible valid RAM size: XXX"
where XXX is clamped value original code uses to after fixup

Argument was that it's not convenient for users do what they
would do on real hw (i.e. calculate desired size manually
based on available banks/DIMMs).

I gave an attempt to dumping all possible sizes and it results
in not practically useful unique ~80 entries list, so that idea
also goes down the drain.

I agree that it's not convenient, but I think that human user
can easily adapt to error message and either fix CLI to use
suggested value (i.e. what they are getting now) or pick desired
DIMMs number/size and do the math.
