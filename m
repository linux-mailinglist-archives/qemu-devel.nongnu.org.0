I think the "!start" check is intended to catch uninitialized BARs.

For memory BARs, I think it works pretty well.  Most PCI host bridges
don't do address translation, so "start" is zero if the BAR contains
zero (the power-up default).  It's conceivable a platform could put a
PCI aperture at CPU physical address zero, but unlikely.  It's also
conceivable that "start" could be zero if the bridge translates
addresses and the BAR happens to contain the complement of the
translation, but that also seems unlikely.

I don't think the check works quite as well for I/O BARs.  Zero is a
perfectly legitimate I/O port, though we could argue that we should
never use it, just like we have decided not to use memory address
zero.

In this case, firmware told us to preserve whatever it left in the
BARs, so if it left zero in an I/O BAR, it's basically telling us we
have to use I/O port zero.
