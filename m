Too many to list really.  In the whole of PAPR, there are probably
dozens of RTAS calls that require hypervisor privilege at some point
along the way.  We probably don't implement that many of them -
there's a bunch of stuff we've never bothered with because Linux
doesn't care.

Well.. yeah.. it is kinda larger than I hoped.

But in comparison *just* the qemu specific parts of SLOF are >4000
lines of Forth.  Overall there's about 20k lines of Forth and 33k
lines of C.  And the number of people who both understand Forth and
have the slightest interest in SLOF is, like.. 2 people?  Maybe 3 if
you count Segher's occasional drive-by rants.

No argument there.  That is absolutely true, and absolutely
intentional.  The idea is to maintain just what we need of the
OS-facing OF interface.

Frankly, while it has some good ideas, I don't think Open Firmware
wasn't that great a concept overall in the 90s[0] - and it has not really
improved with age.

[0] Incidentally I also think EFI's a pretty crappy concept for almost
    exactly the same reasons, but it has the huge advantage of a much
    more actively developed codebase.
