Hm.  I could imagine that there are formats that have non-zero holes
(e.g. 0xff or just garbage).  It would be a bit wrong for them to return
ZERO or DATA then.

But OTOH we don=E2=80=99t care about such cases, do we?  We need to know wh=
ether
ranges are zero, data, or unallocated.  If they aren=E2=80=99t zero, we onl=
y
care about whether reading from it will return data from this layer or not.

So I suppose that anything that doesn=E2=80=99t support backing files (or
filtered children) should always return ZERO and/or DATA.

Hm.  What does that mean?

One of the problems is that =E2=80=9Callocated=E2=80=9D has two meanings:
(1) reading data returns data defined at this backing layer,
(2) actually allocated, i.e. takes up space on the file represented by
this BDS.

As far as I understand, we actually don=E2=80=99t care about (2) in the con=
text
of block_status, but just about (1).

So if a layer returns ZERO, it is by definition (1)-allocated.  (It
isn=E2=80=99t necessarily (2)-allocated.)

What do you mean by =E2=80=9Cremove this short backing file=E2=80=9D?  Beca=
use generally
one can=E2=80=99t just drop a backing file.

So maybe a case like block-stream?  Wouldn=E2=80=99t that be a bug in
block-stream them, i.e. shouldn=E2=80=99t it stream zeros after the end of =
the
backing file?

qcow definitely sounds like it.

Agreed.

The second 3.? :)

Well, yes.

I disagree, because filters with or without backing children should work
exactly the same way and just not appear in the backing chain.

I disagree again for the same reason.
