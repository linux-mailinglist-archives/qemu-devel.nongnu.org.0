Probably a KVM cap, rather than requiring userspace to attempt VCPU
features one at a time with a scratch VCPU.

I suppose. We're collecting many features that are enabling CPU features,
so they map nicely to VCPU features, yet they're effectively VM features
due to a shared resource such as an irq or memory.

Shouldn't this be up to the guest? Or, is this required in order for the
guest to use tagging at all. Something like making the guest IPAs memtag
capable, but if the guest doesn't enable tagging then there is no guest
impact? In any case, shouldn't userspace be the one that adds PROT_MTE
to the memory regions it wants the guest to be able to use tagging with,
rather than KVM adding the attribute page by page?

If userspace needs to write to guest memory then it should be due to
a device DMA or other specific hardware emulation. Those accesses can
be done with tag checking disabled.

Maybe we need a new version of KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG that also provides
the tags for all addresses of each dirty page.

So this is necessary to allow the VMM to keep tag checking enabled for
itself, plus map guest memory as PROT_MTE, and write to that memory when
needed?
