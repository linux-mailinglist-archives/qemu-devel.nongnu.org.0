To be honest, I didn't really review the code nor the documentation.
I actually reviewed only the idea itself in the context of integration
with libvirt and that's why I didn't go for 'Reviewed-by:'.

The gist of the citation above is that we should stick to well known
tags with their well known meanings and I think that considering this a
'review' would be a stretch of the definiton.
