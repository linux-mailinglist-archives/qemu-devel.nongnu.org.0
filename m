What user-mode testing do you think might be improved by using avocado?

IMO at present we have a fairly comprehensive testing infrastructure for
user-mode that is simply underused.  With docker, we have a set of
cross-compilers for most guest architectures, and we are able to build
statically linked binaries that are copied out of the container for
testing by the just-built qemu binaries on the host.  This
infrastructure is used by check-tcg.  It's fairly easy to add new test
cases to be run on one or all guests.

Title:
  [Feature request] acceptance test class to run user-mode binaries

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Currently the acceptance test framework only target system-mode emulation.
  It would be useful to test user-mode too.
