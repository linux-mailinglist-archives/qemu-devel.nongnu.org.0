We have talked about adding support for floating point TCG ops in the
past but I think we would need to be a fair bit farther down the road
before we can attempt that. The overhead of the helper call is
relatively minimal compared to that of the executing the operation
itself. As you can see from all the various front end wrappings around
the softfloat code there is a fair amount of implementation details
you'd need to abstract away into the TCG generation code to make it
useful for all our guests.

I would take some convincing that offloading exception calculation to
another thread would make a difference - surely there would be
inter-thread syncing required? Our main approach to threading has been
trying to improve scalability for softmmu so we can emulate more vCPUs
in the system.
