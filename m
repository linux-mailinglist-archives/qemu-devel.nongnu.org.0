No, I don't think that these old AIX versions ever worked in QEMU. You
might be more or less lucky with later versions, though, see e.g.:

 https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1829682

Anyway, when reporting bugs, please always provide the command line that
you used to start QEMU, otherwise bugs are hardly reproducible.
