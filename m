Hello,

I am leaving Intel, and will soon lose access to my Intel email 
accounts. Effective today, I am no longer maintainer of the HAXM open 
source project (https://github.com/intel/haxm). Colin Xu (colin DOT xu 
AT intel DOT com) will take my place, and he will be helped by Henry 
Yuan (hang DOT yuan AT intel DOT com) as well as the rest of the HAXM 
team at Intel (team email: haxm DASH team AT intel DOT com).

I am grateful for all the support this community has given to HAXM and 
myself over the past few years. I would appreciate your continued 
support for the project and the Intel HAXM team.

Thanks,
Yu
