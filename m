can you find out what are these extra 3 memory regions are and why they are
filtered out from regions that are passed to vhost-user?

I'm more inclined to disabling mixed (provided that's really the case)
anon and FD RAM whenever vhost (user) is used or disable hot plugging
vhost-user device in case machine has mixed RAM.
Otherwise it's just a time bomb, waiting till guest OS tries to transmit
data that it just allocated from anon RAM.
