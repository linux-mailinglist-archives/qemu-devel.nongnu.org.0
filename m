QOM does too much in code.  Turing tarpit.

The external QOM interface is huge.  Even if we had an army of
industrious gnomes writing simple test cases for all of it, we'd still
need a fleet of machines to actually run them, and at least a batallion
of gnomes to maintain them.

The extremely basic qom-test gobbles up a painful amount of CPU cycles
already:

$ time for i in `find bld/*-softmmu -maxdepth 1 -name qemu-system-\* -perm /u+x`; do QTEST_QEMU_BINARY=$i bld/tests/qom-test; done
/aarch64/qom/versatileab: OK
[260 lines of the form name/of/test: OK omitted...]
/xtensaeb/qom/lx60: OK

real	3m33.001s
user	2m18.081s
sys	1m31.809s

We don't always get lucky.

Thinking about how to make the best use of the tests we have is in
order.
