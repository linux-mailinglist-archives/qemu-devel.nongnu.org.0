For contributors doing the full work, does that mean the patchset sent=20
to the list contains the following parts?

1. patch 1: list changed files in tests/bios-tables-test-allowed-diff.h.

2. patches 2-n: real changes, may contain multiple patches.

3. patch n+1: update golden master binaries and empty=20
tests/bios-tables-test-allowed-diff.h

Thanks,

Heyi
