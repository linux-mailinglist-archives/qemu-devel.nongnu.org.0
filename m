Libvirt puts it into an event and emits it to client applications.

When booting a guest it is possible to give an RTC offset for the
guest.  If you shut it off and want to cold boot it again later,
you really want to preserve the RTC offset that the guest might
have updated.  Thus an application like oVirt listens for the
RTC change event and remembers this offset for subsequent boots.

This is especially important for Windows because they keep the
RTC in localtime, so twice a year they change the RTC and you
want to keep track of that.

Are there (mainstream) machines with more than one RTC ?

The original use case only cared about x86 machines and my knowledge of
other targets is minimal.
