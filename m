IMO, if the EL3 firmware is providing the complete DTB, then it should
provide the complete ACPI tables. Otherwise we should expose machine
properties allowing the virt board to generate both DTB and ACPI for an
EL3 firmware configuration.

The other option of using fw-cfg to tweak ACPI tables may work too, but
only for tweaks. If the EL3 firmware controlled DTB changed in a way
that diverges too much from QEMU's ACPI generation, then there'd still
be a problem.

Thanks,
