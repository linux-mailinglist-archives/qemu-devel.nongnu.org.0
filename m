Thanks for the details. The SError injection for aarch32 will be included in v3.

I think "-cpu max,aarch64=off" is only valid when KVM is enabled? If that's true,
the ioctl(cpu, KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, &events) already worked for aarch32 or aarch64
guest if I'm correct enough. But yes, I need to test it because I never tested this
series on aarch32 guest :)

Thanks,
Gavin
