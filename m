I think we also need to clarify what "find the first non-filter" means:
"first" means not skipping over non-filters, but there can still be
multiple parents, and we can take the name of any of them.

In legacy setups, we can expect that there is only one BB that has a
defined name (i.e. nodes aren't reused in multiple subtrees) whereas the
other BBs may come from things like block jobs. We must not give up and
error out when the job BB is returned first.
