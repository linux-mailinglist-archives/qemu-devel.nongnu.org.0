I'm not really sure what you mean by that.  The exact cpu model can be
relevant for pseries in certain edge cases, although in most cases
it's the compat mode that will matter in practice.

> So, is this a no? Thanks,

Yes, although not really for the reasons above.  As you say this is
just for the handful of people who have never-released machines, which
makes this some ugly and confusing cruft for nearly everyone.  So, I'm
more inclined to say that if you happen to have one of those machines,
you get to apply the workaround patch yourself.
