I believe this is not the only situation when vfio-ccw returns
EIO, or?

Does this need to change here? If the kernel is supposed to return ENODEV
then this does not need to change.

I could not agree more, this is semantically uapi and needs to be
properly documented.

With regards to "linux error codes: vs "ionist cc's" an where
the mapping is different example:

"""
/**                                                                             
 * cio_cancel_halt_clear - Cancel running I/O by performing cancel, halt        
 * and clear ordinally if subchannel is valid.                                  
 * @sch: subchannel on which to perform the cancel_halt_clear operation         
 * @iretry: the number of the times remained to retry the next operation        
 *

 * 255 tries with cio_clear. The caller should initialize @iretry with          
 * the value 255 for its first call to this, and keep using the same            
 * @iretry in the subsequent calls until it gets a non -EBUSY return.

 * Returns 0 if device now idle, -ENODEV for device not operational,            
 * -EBUSY if an interrupt is expected (either from halt/clear or from a

Here -ENODEV is not operational.
