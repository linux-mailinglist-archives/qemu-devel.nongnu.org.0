Userspace does not necessarily need to interpret the contents. The
vendor can ship a binary blob and the driver loads the file onto the
device without interpreting it.

VFIO defines how userspace interacts with migration regions, see the
patch series that I linked at the beginning of this discussion.
Userspace has control over pausing/resuming the device and reading
migration blobs.

Migration of encrypted guests. The host kernel and userspace do not
have access to all guest state. Userspace acts as a transport - same
as VFIO migration.

I'm not sure how much of it is already upstream since it's being
actively developed right now, but it's another example where userspace
does not need to and cannot interpret data.

As I've said from the beginning of the discussion, there are multiple
approaches and they are suited to different use cases.

For passthrough devices I think it's preferable for the VMM not to be
involved in the device state representation. This keeps the VMM
simple, avoids code duplication across VMMs, and allows migration to
work in non-virtualization use cases.
