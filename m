The foot gun still exists when migration is considered, no? If userspace
is telling a guest it can use MTE on its normal memory, but then doesn't
prepare that memory correctly, or remember to migrate the tags correctly
(which requires knowing the memory has tags and knowing how to get them),
then I guess the VM is in trouble one way or another.

I feel like we should trust the VMM to ensure MTE will work on any memory
the guest could use it on, and change the action in user_mem_abort() to
abort the guest with a big error message if it sees the flag is missing.

At least QEMU goes through many abstractions to get to memory already.
There may already be a hook we could use, if not, it probably wouldn't
be too hard to add one (famous last words).
