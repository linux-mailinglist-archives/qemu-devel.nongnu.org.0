I can only repeat my comment from when it last came up:

I think the option is useful to boot Linux now until we improve rv100=20
emulation enough to work with the Linux DRM driver so either way you'll=20
have a problem: with -vga none not disabling soldered chip you can't boot=

normal Linux CDs without patching them, with -vga none obeyed you can't=20
use PMON. But since PMON is not bundled in QEMU (we don't have the source=

of the actual board firmware, only a binary) it may be less of a problem=20
than Linux install CDs not working. After install you could change Linux=20
to use radeon framebuffer driver which probably works better. (Although=20
I'm not sure if anyone actually tried to do that.)

But I don't really mind either way, go with what you prefer. I only care=20

Discovery II emulation that's causing problem on pegasos2.

Looks like this above comment was not considered last time, maybe if you=20
change it now this could be fixed as well.
