I apologize for the delay, got distracted.

Reproduced, thanks!

Here's what happens.  Our general problem is that qemu-system-FOO's
main() acts on command line arguments in its own idiosyncratic order.
There's not much method to its madness.  Whenever we find a case where
one kind of command line argument needs to refer to something created
for another kind later, we rejigger the order.

Some time back, Dan Berrang=C3=A9 ran into an "impossible" instance of this
general problem: some kinds of -object get referenced by certain
character devices (therefore, -object must be acted on before character
devices), but other kinds of -object reference other character devices
(therefore, -object must be acted on after character devices).  He
solved the problem by sorting the -object into two buckets (commit
f08f9271bfe):

* Normal ones are created pretty early, so they can be referenced by
  (most) other things.

* Delayed ones are created pretty late, so they can reference (most)
  other things.

The pr-manager-helper object is a delayed one (commit 7c9e527659c).

Worked because block backends got created even after delayed objects:

    qemu_opts_foreach(qemu_find_opts("object"),
                      user_creatable_add_opts_foreach,
                      object_create_initial, &error_fatal);
    [...]
    qemu_opts_foreach(qemu_find_opts("object"),
                      user_creatable_add_opts_foreach,
                      object_create_delayed, &error_fatal);
    [...]
    configure_blockdev(&bdo_queue, machine_class, snapshot);

Commit cda4aa9a5a0 moved the configure_blockdev() up:

    qemu_opts_foreach(qemu_find_opts("object"),
                      user_creatable_add_opts_foreach,
                      object_create_initial, &error_fatal);
    [...]
    /*
     * Note: we need to create block backends before
     * machine_set_property(), so machine properties can refer to
     * them.
     */
    configure_blockdev(&bdo_queue, machine_class, snapshot);
    [...]
    qemu_opts_foreach(qemu_find_opts("object"),
                      user_creatable_add_opts_foreach,
                      object_create_delayed, &error_fatal);

Now file-posix property "pr-manager" can no longer reference a
pr-manager-helper object.  Regression.

If I make pr-manager-helper a normal object, it again can reference it.

Paolo, why is pr-manager-helper a delayed object?  Why this hunk of
commit 7c9e527659c:
