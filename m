This is a combo patchset.=20


These are prereqs fixes related to the presenter and how CAM lines
are scanned. This is in direct relation with the CPU_FOREACH() issue.

  ppc/xive: Introduce a XivePresenter interface
  ppc/xive: Implement the XivePresenter interface
  ppc/pnv: Introduce a PNV_CHIP_CPU_FOREACH() helper
  ppc/pnv: Introduce a pnv_xive_is_cpu_enabled() helper
  ppc/xive: Introduce a XiveFabric interface
  ppc/pnv: Implement the XiveFabric interface
  ppc/spapr: Implement the XiveFabric interface
  ppc/xive: Use the XiveFabric and XivePresenter interfaces

These are for interrupt resend (escalation). To be noted, the removal=20
of the get_tctx() XiveRouter handler which has some relation with=20
the previous subserie.

  ppc/xive: Extend the TIMA operation with a XivePresenter parameter
  ppc/pnv: Clarify how the TIMA is accessed on a multichip system
  ppc/xive: Move the TIMA operations to the controller model
  ppc/xive: Remove the get_tctx() XiveRouter handler
  ppc/xive: Introduce a xive_tctx_ipb_update() helper
  ppc/xive: Introduce helpers for the NVT id
  ppc/xive: Synthesize interrupt from the saved IPB in the NVT

This is a bug :

  ppc/pnv: Remove pnv_xive_vst_size() routine
  ppc/pnv: Dump the XIVE NVT table
  ppc/pnv: Skip empty slots of the XIVE NVT table

This is a model for the block id configuration and better support
for multichip systems :=20

  ppc/pnv: Introduce a pnv_xive_block_id() helper
  ppc/pnv: Extend XiveRouter with a get_block_id() handler

Misc improvements :=20

  ppc/pnv: Quiesce some XIVE errors
  ppc/xive: Introduce a xive_os_cam_decode() helper
  ppc/xive: Check V bit in TM_PULL_POOL_CTX
  ppc/pnv: Improve trigger data definition
  ppc/pnv: Use the EAS trigger bit when triggering an interrupt from PSI


I should move some in front to have them merged before hand if=20
possible. They have been on the list for 3 months.=20
