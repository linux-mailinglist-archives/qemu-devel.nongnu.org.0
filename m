  Hi,

Yes, we basically have to add a Error* arg to the init callback so the
drivers can return error messages.  I've started looking into this a
while back, will try to resume the effort once we have this series
finally merged.

debian and fedora have cross compilers for windows (mingw project)
which is supported by qemu and is probably easier than getting things
built on windows.

macos does at least build, but I have macos only in a vm without
sound support so I can't test whenever it actually works ...

Peter, any chance you can give this a try?

cheers,
  Gerd
