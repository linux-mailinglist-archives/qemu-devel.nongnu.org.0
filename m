The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  SDL Doesn't Rescale Image on Resolution Change

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Whilst in fullscreen mode, if the guest changes resolution for
  whatever reason, the screen doesn't update the scaling so you end up
  looking at only part of the screen, e.g. if the guest changes from
  640x480 to 1024x768, the image will still be fullscreen, but what
  you're actually looking at will be the top-left most 640x480 segment
  of the screen stretched out.

  Manually going out of fullscreen mode and then back in fixes the
  scaling, but you have to do that every time the guest changes
  resolution.

  QEmu 2.12.0 using qemu-system-x86_64 with Arch Linux host.
