This patch already looks somewhat complicated to me, and what you're
proposing below sounds another order of magnitude more complex.

But I think the important point is your last sentence above. Once we
acknowledge that we can't possibly maintain full transaction semantics,
I'll ask this naive question: What prevents us from just keeping the
additional write in .commit?

It is expected to work in the common case, so we're only talking about
the behaviour in error cases anyway. If something fails and we can't do
things in a transactionable way, we need to decide what the surprise
result will look like, because we can neither guarantee a rollback nor
successful completion.

If the write fails unexpectedly, and we end up with a qcow2 image that
is opened r/w, but has read-only bitmaps - wouldn't that be a reasonable
result? It seems much easier to explain than some dependency subchain
already being committed and the rest rolled back.

So, I guess my question is, what is the specifc scenario you're trying
to fix with this series (why isn't the final patch a test case that
would answer this question?), and are we sure that the cure isn't worse
than the disease?
