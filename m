Because checkpatch.pl doesn't warn about this :-)

True about this - this is another reason this is RFC,

I honestly didn't finish the documentation,
since the sudden change to drop all of this interface.

not.
This is because to be not luks specific we must use some kind of an union
which means that the user has to specify the driver which I didn't want t=
o do.
Now all of you convinced me ( :-) ) to do this so this will be done when =
I switch
to the amend interface.

The reason for that was to save on code duplication internally.
Internally (as in block device callback, and generic crypto code callback=
),
both options are folded in one, with 'action' field to distinguish betwee=
n them
and that structure.
If I use amend interface, I also would have to have some amend option tha=
t
will tell to erase the key. It one of the things I wanted to ask you
with that RFC, how would you solve this in single amend interface.
