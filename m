Hold up -- why does an OPEN zone transition to FULL on power up? The
spec suggests it should be CLOSED. The spec does appear to support going
to FULL on a NVM Subsystem Reset, though. Actually, now that I'm looking
at this part of the spec, these implicit transitions seem a bit less
clear than I expected. I'm not sure it's clear enough to evaluate qemu's
compliance right now.

But I don't see what testing these transitions has to do with having a
persistent state. You can reboot your VM without tearing down the
running QEMU instance. You can also unbind the driver or shutdown the
controller within the running operating system. That should make those
implicit state transitions reachable in order to exercise your FTL's
recovery.

I agree the persistent state provides conveniences for developers. I
just don't want to gate ZNS enabling on it either since the core design
doesn't depend on it.
