Yes, we indeed discuss a new "strict" parameter but not a "expose" in v2 
[1] of this series.
[1] 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/20210413080745.33004-6-wangyanan55@huawei.com/

And in the discussion, we hoped things would work like below with 
"strict" parameter:
Users who want to describe cpu topology should provide cmdline like

-smp strict=on,cpus=4,sockets=2,cores=2,threads=1

and in this case we require an more accurate -smp configuration and
then generate the cpu topology description through ACPI/DT.

While without a strict description, no cpu topology description would
be generated, so they get nothing through ACPI/DT.

It seems to me that the "strict" parameter actually serves as a knob to
turn on/off the exposure of topology, and this is the reason I changed
the name.

Yanan
