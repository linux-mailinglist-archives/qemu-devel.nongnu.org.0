This is surprising to me.  I never thought QOM was targeted at
the CLI or RPC.  (Every single property mentioned in this message
don't seem to be related to the CLI or RPC.)

About the visitors: I always had the impression that usage of
visitors inside QOM is unnecessary and avoidable (compared to
QAPI, where the visitors are an essential feature).

Do we really need need QOM children to be accessible using the QOM
property API?

Using the same code for both user-configurable properties and for
the list of children of a QOM object might have saved some time
years ago, but I'm not sure this is still a necessary or useful
abstraction.
