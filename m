I'd argue that we're boosting archives.fedoraproject.org morale.  As a
public Internet service, it begs to better be used! :)

Now, more seriously, I agree that we should coordinate with them.  I
have the feeling that it shouldn't be a problem of resources per se,
given that we're redirecting traffic.  But, it may be a matter of
letting them better allocate these resources.

Daniel,

You seem to have some much better than average knowledge about the
mirror structure.  Does that mean you know who to contact about this?

Thanks,
