Forwards errp to vmdk_create_extent().

Also asserts errp == NULL, which looks suspicious.  Not your problem.

> error_append_security_model_hint
> error_append_socket_sockfd_hint

Convenience functions to append a canned hint with error_append_hint().
Their name makes confusion unlikely.

> qemu_file_get_error_obj

Returns an error object in an unusual way: error_copy() instead of
error_setg().

Suspicious-looking qemu_file_set_error_obj() nearby: it either stores
@err in @f, or reports it to stderr / current monitor.  Not your
problem.

> hmp_handle_error

Covered by your patch, already discussed.

> qbus_list_bus
> qbus_list_dev

Convenience functions to append hints with error_append_hint().
Function names do not hint at that (pardon the pun).

> kvmppc_hint_smt_possible

Convenience function to append hints with error_append_hint().  Function
name hints weakly.

> vnc_client_io_error

Covered by your patch, already discussed.

> error_handle_fatal
> error_setv
> error_prepend
> error_setg_win32_internal
> error_free_or_abort

Let's not worry about error.c itself.

> vmdk_co_create_opts_cb and qemu_file_get_error_obj are false positives I think

Agree.
