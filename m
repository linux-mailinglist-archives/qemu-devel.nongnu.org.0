Hi Daniel,
Yeah for "us" being Ubuntu that would certainly be true.
An upgrade of librbd.so.1 to librbd.so.2 would only happen at a major
upgrade.
For example in Ubuntu terms e.g. 18.04 to 20.04. Those upgrades usually
come with a requirement to reboot anyway - I'm not trying to solve these.

The much more common and frequent small updates to qemu with individual
fixes are what triggers this bug and what my proposal would solve.

On the other hand this is not a big amount of new code, so is not

I already suggested opt-in configure before.
I'd keep this just enable/disable unless we really can't agree on a path.
That should be no big issue to add this in v2.

I'm also uneasy about the idea of using a search path ordering for

Yes that build-id is what prevents it loading the modules of the new
package.

The intention was to keep this change small and not a burden for anyone.
I'm not yet having an idea for a conceptual change that would avoid to rely
on the build-id AND at the same time not make this a huge patch with
probably many new issues we'll find out only much later.
