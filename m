There is a backwards-compatibility problem: we cannot call
vhost_get_features() with the full set of feature bits that each device
type supports because existing vhost-user backends don't advertise
features properly. QEMU disables features not advertised by the
vhost-user backend.

For example, if we add VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX then it will always be
disabled for existing libvhost-user backends because they don't
advertise this bit :(.

The reason I introduced vhost_get_default_features() is to at least
salvage VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM and VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED. These bits can
be safely negotiated for all devices.

Any new transport/vring VIRTIO feature bits can also be added to
vhost_get_default_features() safely.

If a vhost-user device wants to use device type-specific feature bits
then it really needs to call vhost_get_features() directly as you
suggest. But it's important to check whether existing vhost-user
backends actually advertise them - because if they don't advertise them
but rely on them then we'll break existing backends.

Would you prefer a different approach?

The net device is in good shape and doesn't use vhost_default_feature_bits[=
].

vhost_default_feature_bits[] is for devices that haven't been
negotiating feature bits properly. The goal is start involving them in
feature negotiation without breaking existing backends.

Would you like me to rephrase this comment in some way?

Maybe the comment should say "New transport/vring feature bits". I'm
thinking about things like VIRTIO_F_RING_PACKED that are not
device-specific but require backend support.

The GSO features you mentioned are device-specific. Devices that want to
let the backend advertise device-specific features cannot use
vhost_default_feature_bits[].

Would you prefer:

  extern const int vhost_default_feature_bits[];

And then callers do:

  vhost_get_features(hdev, vhost_default_feature_bits, features);

?
