As it is, this series depends on my block branch, most importantly
Andrey=E2=80=99s series =E2=80=9Cblock/stream: get rid of the base=E2=80=9D=
.

Depends-on: <1559152576-281803-1-git-send-email-andrey.shinkevich@virtuoz=
zo.com>

This series made the problem apparent to me, but it existed before:
Namely, the commit and mirror block jobs create filter nodes which they
just try to drop with an &error_fatal.  If any of its parent links is
frozen, that will abort qemu.  Patch 1 fixes this by adding a
BDS.never_freeze flag, which prevents bdrv_freeze_backing_chain() from
freezing any links to a BDS that has this flag set.

Now, after Andrey=E2=80=99s series, you can reproduce this problem by fir=
st
launching a commit job and then launching a stream job from the commit=E2=
=80=99s
top node.  This is actually something that iotest 030 tests, but I
didn=E2=80=99t notice the problem because 030 has two problems of itself:
(1) It fails to do proper throttling, so usually, the commit job is
    already gone by the time the stream job starts.  (Fixed by patch 2.)
(2) It doesn=E2=80=99t check the error message, but just the error class.=
  If it
    had checked the error message, we would have seen that it just says
    that the stream=E2=80=99s base node cannot be found, and thus would h=
ave
    fixed problem #1 earlier.  (Fixed by patch 3.)

If you apply patches 2 and 3 to my block branch, you=E2=80=99ll see that =
both
jobs can be created.  If you remove the check that creating the stream
job should fail and replace the self.wait_until_completed() by a
self.vm.run_job('drive0'), you will see that qemu aborts.

So that appears to be a new problem introduced by Andrey=E2=80=99s series=
,
right?  But it actually isn=E2=80=99t new.  Patch 5 adds a test for a
pre-existing case:

If on master you launch a commit job and then a stream job from the
commit=E2=80=99s filter node, qemu will abort (if the commit job complete=
s
before the stream job, at least).  So the problem existed well before
Andrey=E2=80=99s series, it just moved it down one node.
(You can test that by applying patches 2 through 5 on master.  You will
get a failure in test_overlapping_4, and a qemu abort in
test_overlapping_5.)

In turn, thanks to said series, this test case now fully works.  (So you
can stream from a commit=E2=80=99s filter node.)


So either way, the problem addressed by patch 1 is visible both on
master and on my block branch.  It just appears in different places,
hence the dependency.
