There is one more option which can be relatively easily tested:
you can add two more ports (or replace the existing ttya/ttyb) to the
qemu's ultra5 model: the escc (aka zs) ports.
They definitely work under Solaris (Ultra-1, Ultra-2, E3000,
E3500...), I've seen it.
OpenBIOS already has a driver for them which is used for sun4m (and
some ppc) targets. So no new devices have to be implemented.
If your and Jasper's theory proofs to be correct, we can think of
replacing ttya/ttyb su with zs.
I guess the other sun4u operating systems do support zs as well. (This
has to be tested though)

I think I managed booting Tribblix under the QEMU niagara target. It
has less devices than sun4u, but the console was working.
