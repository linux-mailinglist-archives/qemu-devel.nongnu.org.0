Thanks for your comments. Yes, "irregular" is definitely better words. I failed
to find the statement that ARM64 has the requirement for 1:1 mapping between
socket and NUMA node, which makes it hard to tell if the restriction is required
from architectural level. However, the linux driver (drivers/base/arch_topology.c)
considers both CPU-to-NUMA-association and CPU toplogy from ACPI PPTT when the
CPU set in the core group is calculated. It means the CPU-to-NUMA-association
can affect the CPU topology seen by Linux scheduler.

With the restriction of 1:1 mapping between socket and NUMA node, or between
cluster and NUMA node as I mentioned in the reply to Daniel P. Berrangé <berrange@redhat.com>,
the existing configuration for other OSes can become invalid.

Yes, a comment to mention it's a platform choice, not architectural requirement,
definitely helps to understand the context.

Thanks,
Gavin
