Ouch.  I didn't expect xhci being called like that.  IMO memory.c should
do properly aligned 4-byte reads, then extract the bytes needed, i.e.
2-byte read @ both offset 0 and 2 would result in xhci being called with
a 4-byte read at offset 0, then memory.c would extract the lower or upper
bytes and return them to the guest.

Well, the point of having MemoryRegionOps.valid and MemoryRegionOps.impl
in the first place is to allow memory.c handle this on behalf of the
device, so we don't end up reinventing the wheel in each and every
device ...

So, I think xhci is correct and memory.c has a bug somewhere (and it
seems Philippe is on track pinning it down ...)

cheers,
