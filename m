It may also be possible to permit a discriminated union to be the branch 
value of yet another discriminated union: as long as the set of member 
names made visible by the inner union do not collide with any of the 
visible members elsewhere in the outer union, this should be okay, and 
give the same effect of being an unboxed member.

I really want to improve at least nbd-server-start to avoid the nesting 
(it was a pain to use that much nesting while working on incremental 
backup).

Agree that two is more difficult. For at least nbd-server-start, I'm 
fine with replace-and-deprecate.

And less special code to maintain.
