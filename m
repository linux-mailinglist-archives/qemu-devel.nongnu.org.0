https://qemu-devel.nongnu.narkive.com/jUimpLt0/patch-vhost-net-initialize-a=
cked-features-to-a-safe-value-during-ack
This review of a patch that introduced "acked_features =3D backend_features=
" behaviour suggests that acked_features should be 0 by default, but it end=
ed up pushing it as it is now (as they say that not setting acked_features =
to backend_features sometimes makes acked_features value 'unexpected')

Other devices initialize acked_features to guest_features (basically
what VM writes to driver_features ANDed with device_features), changing
default value to any of those (0 as review initially suggested, or
guest_features) should fix this problem for us

Title:
  Incorrect feature negotiation for vhost-vdpa netdevice

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  QEMU cmdline:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=3Dkvm -m 2G -hda  /gau=
tam/centos75_1.qcow2 -name gautam,process=3Dgautam -enable-kvm -netdev vhos=
t-vdpa,id=3Dmynet0,vhostdev=3D/dev/vhost-vdpa-0 -device virtio-net-pci,netd=
ev=3Dmynet0,mac=3D02:AA:BB:DD:00:20,disable-modern=3Doff,page-per-vq=3Don -=
cpu host --nographic

  Host OS:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  Linux kernel 5.11 running on x86 host

  Guest OS:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  CentOS 7.5

  Root cause analysis:
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  For vhost-vdpa netdevice, the feature negotiation results in sending
  the superset of features received from device in call to get_features
  vdpa ops callback.

  During the feature-negotiation phase, the acknowledged feature bits
  are initialized with backend_features  and then checked for supported
  feature bits in vhost_ack_features():

  void vhost_net_ack_features(struct vhost_net *net, uint64_t features)
  {
    net->dev.acked_features =3D net->dev.backend_features;
    vhost_ack_features(&net->dev, vhost_net_get_feature_bits(net), features=
);
  }

   =

  The vhost_ack_features() function just builds up on the dev.acked_feature=
s and never trims it down:

  void vhost_ack_features(struct vhost_dev *hdev, const int *feature_bits, =
uint64_t features)
  {     const int *bit =3D feature_bits;

        while (*bit !=3D VHOST_INVALID_FEATURE_BIT) {
             uint64_t bit_mask =3D (1ULL << *bit);      =


              if (features & bit_mask)
                   hdev->acked_features |=3D bit_mask;

              bit++;
         }
  }

  Because of this hdev->acked_features is always minimally equal to the
  value of device features and this is the value that is passed to the
  device in set_features callback:

  static int vhost_dev_set_features(struct vhost_dev *dev, bool enable_log)
  {
         uint64_t *features =3D dev->acked_features;
         .....
         r =3D dev->vhost_ops->*vhost_set_features*(dev, features);
  }
