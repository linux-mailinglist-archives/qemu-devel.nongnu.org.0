The point where the device calls into the generic block layer is where
the functions that start with blk_ are called (blk_aio_pwritev() and
blk_aio_preadv() are probably the most interesting ones).

The callback path in scsi-disk is not that easy to follow, but in the
end, error returns should result in scsi_handle_rw_error() being called
where error codes are translated into SCSI sense codes.

That scenario doesn't make a lot of sense to me either, but blkdebug can
just inject any error code, even nonsensical ones.

Note that depending on the rerror/werror options, QEMU may not deliver
errors to the guest, but stop VMs instead. If the monitor is still
responsive, it's likely that you just got a stopped VM rather than a
hanging QEMU.

The default is that the VM is stopped for ENOSPC and other errors are
delivered to the guest.
