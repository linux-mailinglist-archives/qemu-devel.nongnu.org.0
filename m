I'd like to encourage you to consider this once more.  Dropping legacy

By making the device clearly different that way, you don't need to
discuss differences in detail.  In particular, backward compatibility
can be treated as non-issue.  But I'd still like to see a higher level
discussion of the differences.  In your KVM Forum presentation, you
covered v1's deficits (slide 5), and v2's key differences (slide 6).

docs/specs/ivshmem-spec.txt documents numerous v1 deficits.  Referring
to that document might be helpful.

Less of an issue (or none-issue?) now that you use a fresh Vendor ID /
Device ID pair.

Right.  Perhaps we can convey that more clearly to readers who forgot

now.

In case you keep legacy INTx support: I'd phrase this as a (strong)

Two more reasons to ditch legacy INTx.

For each of these, I'd like to see an clear notice of deviation from the
PCI spec, and rationale (why are deviating).

The PCI spec is cool with devices that only implement one of the two.
But shipping one kind of device come in two such different flavours
while still sharing the same Vendor ID, Device ID is something that
would get a hardware vendor yelled at, and rightfully so.

Now, this isn't physical hardware.  And you might have a high tolerance
for getting yelled at.

Still, yet another reason to ditch legacy INTx.

If not, I'd advocate for a more prominent "caveat emptor" sticker on
this particular, unusual feature.

I see.  Mirroring it just for spec compliance may not be worthwhile.
Please explain this in this document.

Sad.  BARs changing size while Vendor ID, Device ID stays the same is
unusual, but the other BARs *have* be that way, so this one hardly makes
it more unusual.

Where?  Is it "guest driver should rather obtain the

memory"?

Running a lone guest with an ivshmem device wouldn't be out of spec.

How does this play with MSI-X per-vector masking?

I'm confused.  Can you explain the difference?

INTx has no concept of vectors, it uses pins.  Suggest to be a bit more
verbose to avoid confusion.
