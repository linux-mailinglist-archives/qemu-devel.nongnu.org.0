If they're running the same user ID & not SELinux constrained, I don't
think that trying to block PRACTE / /proc/$PID/mem offers a reassuring
level of security separation, as there's still plenty of other files
that will be readable & writable to both vhostuser helper daemons which
can be leveraged as indirect attack vectors - auditing both helpers and
every library they link to to ensure nothing can be exploited is very
hard.
