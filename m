Can we implement the lightweight variant of this, namely extend
"pc-bios/README" to communicate this limitation? What you describe above
could be the very first paragraph (a file-top banner) in that file.


Also, it seems like "pc-bios/README" does not get installed under
$PREFIX/share/qemu. That looks like a general omission around
INSTALL_BLOBS / BLOBS to me. I can't remember -- was this the case
(i.e., "pc-bios/README" not getting installed) before the Meson
conversion too? (CC Paolo, Marc-André.)

Hm... even at the time of commit 26ce90fde5ce ("Makefile: install the
edk2 firmware images and their descriptors", 2019-04-17), BLOBS didn't
cover the "pc-bios/README" file.

Thanks,
Laszlo
