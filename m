But the case you describe in the commit message is not that one.
The analogy is that of a serial port *plugged* and asserting flow 
control.

Another thing is that the "system" as been constructed this way by the
user. QEMU is not in a position to choose and output what is convenient,
when it is convenient. In my world, the serial output is absolutely
crucial. This is where I look for clues about failures and odd 
behaviours,
and I rely on the serial port emulation to be 100% reliable (and for 
what
it's worth, the Linux kernel can output to the serial port 
asynchronously,
to some extent).

That'd be an option if you could configure the UART with something that 
says
"no flow control". In that case, dropping data on the floor becomes 
perfectly
acceptable, as it requires buy-in from the user.

Thanks,
