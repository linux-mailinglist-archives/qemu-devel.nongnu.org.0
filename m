Ok, obviously I don't know the details of that future socket/plug plan, but 
what I could also imagine for the long-term: allowing to optionally define 
'config' nodes as subnodes of devices. Maybe that's similar to what you had in 
mind with that socket/plug model.

Ok, I'll have a look at that '*-set' alternative tomorrow.

But on doubt: I will simply disable those the implied pci and virtio tests for 
the time being.

I need the 'local' backend tests and have to move on; they are of much more 
value than those 2 implied pci and virtio tests.
