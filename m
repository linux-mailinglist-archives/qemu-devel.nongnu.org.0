I've submitted a patch, this is my first qemu patch so sorry if I didn't

Title:
  segfault mremap 4096

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  a qemu-hosted process segfaults when the program calls mremap to
  shrink the size of a buffer to 4096 that was allocated with mmap. See
  below for a C program to reproduce this issue.  I was able to compile
  this program for both i386 and 32-bit arm, and use qemu-i386 and qemu-
  arm to reproduce the segfault.  If I run the i386 program natively on
  my x86_64 system, no segfault occurs.  Also note that if I change the
  mremap size to something else such as 12288, no segfault occurs.  I
  also confirmed using qemu's -singlestep debug option that the segfault
  occurs during the mremap syscall.

  If you save the source below to mremapbug.c, the following should
  reproduce the issue given you have gcc-multilib:

  gcc -m32 mremapbug.c
  # works
  ./a.out
  # segfault
  qemu-i386 a.out

  If you can also compile to arm, the same thing happens when running
  "qemu-arm a.out".  I also tried compiling natively and running "qemu-
  x86_64 a.out" but no segfault in that case, not sure if it's because
  it is 64-bits or if it was because it was my native target.

  #define _GNU_SOURCE
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <sys/mman.h>

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    const size_t initial_size =3D 8192;

    printf("calling mmap, size=3D%llu\n", (unsigned long long)initial_size);
    void *mmap_ptr =3D mmap(NULL, initial_size,
                     PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE ,
                     MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS,
                     -1, 0);
    printf("mmap returned  : %p\n", mmap_ptr);
    if (mmap_ptr =3D=3D MAP_FAILED) {
      perror("mmap");
      exit(1);
    }

    const size_t new_size =3D 4096;
    printf("calling mremap, size=3D%llu\n", (unsigned long long)new_size);
    void *remap_ptr =3D mremap(mmap_ptr, initial_size, new_size, 0);
    printf("mremap returned: %p\n", remap_ptr);
    if (remap_ptr !=3D mmap_ptr) {
      perror("mreamap");
      exit(1);
    }
    printf("Success: pointers match\n");
  }

  This issue was found while I was pushing code that calls "mremap" to the =
Zig compiler repository, it's CI testing uses qemu-i386 and qemu-arm to run=
 tests for non-native hosts.  I've filed an issue in that repository as wel=
l with details on how to reproduce this issue with the Zig compiler as well=
