Sorry about that, this is my literal first patch submission to the
kernel devlists ever, I'm still getting my environment set up (just
learning mutt as I type this).

Gourry is a nickname I go by, but I see pseudonyms are not particularly
welcome on the lists, so no worries.


In addition, I'm relatively new to the QEMU, CXL, and PCIe ecosystem, so
please excuse some of my ignorance of the overall state of things -
doing my best to pickup as quickly as possible.

Presently this is untested for exactly the reasons you described. I had
originally intended to shoot off a cover letter with this patch
discussing the issue, but I managed to much that up... so lets just plop
that in here:


[PATCH RFC] hw/cxl: Volatile Type-3 CXL Devices

The idea behind this patch is simple: Not all type-3 devices are
persistent memory devices, so add a simple boolean (is_pmem) to the
attributes of type-3 devices and have the mailbox-utility report memory
accordingly (persistent_capacity if is_pmem, else volatile_capacity).

In an emulated system, there isn't really a difference between the
devices except for the backing storage (file vs ram), but having an
emulation mode for each is useful for the sake of testing fabric
manager/orchestrator corner cases.

At the moment this can be tested with `cxl list` and it will show
the ram capacity as requested, instead of pmem capacity.


There are a few issues with this patch set that i'm not able to discern
the right answer to just yet, and was hoping for some input:

1) The PCI device type is set prior to realize/attributes, and is
currently still set to PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_EXPRESS.  Should this instead
be PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_CXL when presenting as a simple memory expander?


1a) If so, that means we'll probably need to make type-3 into an abstract
class of devices and explicitly create devices that represents vmem and
pmem devices separately.  That could probably be done within cxl_type3.c
since most of the code will be shared anyway.

But this is confusing, because a pmem device can be made to operate in
volatile mode... so should it ALSO be assigned as PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_CXL,
and a volatile device simply be a pmem device with persistence turned
off? Many design questions here.


1b) If not, does this have an appreciable affect on system-setup from
the perspective of the EFI/Bios? It should be possible, (see #2) to have
the EFI/bios setup memory expanders and just present them to the kernel
as additional, available memory as if more ram is simply present.



2) EDK2 sets the memory area as a reserved, and the memory is not
configured by the system as ram.  I'm fairly sure edk2 just doesn't
support this yet, but there's a chicken/egg problem.  If the device
isn't there, there's nothing to test against... if there's nothing to
test against, no one will write the support.  So I figure we should kick
start the process (probably by getting it wrong on the first go around!)



3) Upstream linux drivers haven't touched ram configurations yet.  I
just configured this with Dan Williams yesterday on IRC.  My
understanding is that it's been worked on but nothing has been
upstreamed, in part because there are only a very small set of devices
available to developers at the moment.


4) Should (is_pmem) be defaulted to 'true' (or invert and make the flag
(is_vmem)), and should pmem devices also present their memory as
volatile capacity?  I think they should, because all pmem devices should
be capable of running in a volatile mode.

My understanding of the current design is the the memdev backing itself
is irrelevant.  You can totally have file-memdevs backing a volatile
reagion and a ram-memdev backing a persistent region.

By adding more/alternative flags that can conflict with each other, we
will also create a boondoggle on intialization.

I had first considered making Type3Dev into an abstract device and
instantiating separate explicit pmem and vmem devices, but ultimatly
that just looked like 2 empty structures wrapping Type3Dev and setting
the internal is_pmem boolean... lol.

Seems a little odd to use two memory backends.  Of what use is it to the
software developers, it should be completely transparent to them, right?

The only thing I can think of is maybe reset mechanics for volatile
regions being set differently than persistent regions, but even then it
seems simple enough to just emulate the behavior and use a single
backing device.

I had considered this, but - at least in my head - you're describing a
multi-logical device.  The device we're looking at right now is a basic
Single-Logical Device which can be either persistent or volatile.

This goes back to my question:  Should we be designing this SLD as a
component which can slot into an MLD, or are there special features of
a MLD sub-device that aren't present on an SLD?

Basically I just don't see the need for multiple backends, as opposed to
multiple devices which are separately manageable.

If I'm misunderstanding something, please let me know.

this would be another reason to simply default the pmem flag to true.
It would allow existing setups to continue as-is.

I can make this swap, but i think the above discussions were more
important to get started (and why this is an RFC).

I had actually wondered about all these 256MB alignment checks, and
whether they should actually be sunken into the device creation rather
than strewn around.  I would have to go digging through the spec to see
whether there is explicit error handling at each level if a device
presents an out-of-spec size.

Something for another patch.

Will drop that from the patch
