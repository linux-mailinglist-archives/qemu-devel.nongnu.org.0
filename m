Taking from the wiki page mention:

  - both 32 and 64 bit architectures
  - the roll of A/M profile chips
  - warn about kernel portability
  - gently suggest -M virt
  - add headlines for groups of boards

This is still incomplete but hopefully is a less of a straight dive
into a dry list of peripherals.

+Use the executable ``qemu-system-arm`` to simulate a 32 bit ARM
+machine. The ``qemu-system-aarch64`` executable is used to simulate
+the 64 bit ARM AArch64 architecture. AArch64 CPUs can often include an
+AArch32 execution unit and execute a mix of 64 and 32 bit code.
+
+The emulator supports both "A-profile" and "M-profile" CPUs. The
+A-profile CPUs have a full MMU and can run things like the Linux while
+the M-profile CPUs are typically used in embedded micro-controller
+boards.
+
+Because ARM systems differ so much and in fundamental ways, typically
+operating system or firmware images intended to run on one machine
+will not run at all on any other.
+
+If you don't care about running on a particular piece of hardware the
+``-M virt`` board provides a PCI based virtio board which can be
+configured with a range of RAM sizes, CPU types and virtio based
+peripherals. It is generally the target you want to use if general
+purpose operating systems.
