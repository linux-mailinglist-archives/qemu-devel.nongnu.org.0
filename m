My convincing strategy is "do nothing" :-)

Most importantly we need to be able to make the existing "QEMU" component
in launch read-only to prevent people filing new bugs there, ideally with
a change in the description to point people to the new bug tracker.

We can leave existing bugs in LP to continue their discussion. If there
are some we explicitly want in gitlab manually re-file them. Aside from
that if we periodically auto-close any stale bugs, after a while we'll
have culled launchpad down to zero.

Daniel
