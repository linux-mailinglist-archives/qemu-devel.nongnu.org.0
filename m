so, if we use file system based approach, could openstack periodically check and
update the migration info?
e.g.
every minute, read /sys/<path to device>/migration/self/*, and if there
are any file disappearing or appearing or content changes, just let the
placement know.

Then when about to start migration, check source device's
/sys/<path to src device>/migration/compatible/* and searches the
placement if there are existing device matching to it,
if yes, create vm with the device and migrate to it;
if not, and if it's an mdev, try to create a matching one and migrate to
it.
(to create a matching mdev, I guess openstack can follow below sequence:
1. find a target device with the same device id (e.g. parent pci id)
2. create an mdev with matching mdev type
3. adjust other vendor specific attributes
4. if 2 or 3 fails, go to 1 again
)

is this approach feasible?

by migration database, I meant the traits in the placement. :)

if a periodic monitoring or devlink is required, then periodically
monitor sysfs is also viable, right?
