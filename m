No problem - asking questions is how we learn.

That was the opposite direction - in that commit, we were removing stale 
comments about a member that was no longer present (if the member is not 
present, the doc engine doesn't know what to attach the tag to, and we 
now have the better qemu-deprecated.texi file for tracking removals). 
And even if the removal is not documented, users that depended on it 
(which should be few, or we would not have removed it), it becomes 
fairly obvious at the attempted point of use that it no longer works.

But when the member is present, but added later than the original 
struct, knowing what release the additional members were added is useful 
documentation when deciding whether support for the new member is 
present on all versions of qemu you care about, or whether your 
management code has to consider the case when the member was absent. 
Yes, you can get the same information from introspection 
programmatically (in fact, when libvirt has to deal with new additions, 
that's how it probes whether the addition is there), but having the 
consistent documentation reminds someone to think about whether checking 
the introspection is necessary.
