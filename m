I thought that QEMU just excluded nodes which are not capable of being
snapshotted. By using exclusions, the mgmt apps don't have to know
about what types of storage driver QEMU supports snapshots on, just let
QEMU decide. It also felt simpler to use exclusions as normal case would
be to snapshot everything.   Both inclusions/exclusions are easy to
implement in QEMU though.
