The functionalities of individual ioctls were described in this series
patch commit messages.

Testing method for RTC ioctls:

    Mini test programs were written for each ioctl. Those programs were
    compiled (sometimes using cross-compilers) for the following
    architectures:

        * Intel 64-bit (little endian)
        * Power pc 32-bit (big endian)
        * Power pc 64-bit (big endian)

    The corresponding native programs were executed without using
    QEMU on following hosts:

        * Intel Core i7-4790K (x86_64 host)
        * Power 7447A (ppc32 host)

    All applicable compiled programs were in turn executed through QEMU
    and the results obtained were the same ones gotten for native
    execution.

    Example of a test program:

        For ioctl RTC_RD_TIME the following test program was used:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <linux/rtc.h>
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <linux/input.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <unistd.h>

        #define ERROR -1

        int main()
        {

            int fd = open("/dev/rtc", O_RDWR | O_NONBLOCK);

            if(fd == ERROR)
            {
                perror("open");
                return -1;
            }

            struct rtc_time cur_time;

            if(ioctl(fd, RTC_RD_TIME, &cur_time) < 0)
            {
                perror("ioctl");
                return -1;
            }

            printf("Second: %d, Minute: %d, Hour: %d, Day: %d, Month: %d, Year: %d,",
                cur_time.tm_sec, cur_time.tm_min, cur_time.tm_hour, 
                cur_time.tm_mday, cur_time.tm_mon, cur_time.tm_year);

            return 0;
        }

    Limitations of testing:

        The test host pc that was used for testing (intel pc) has RTC
        that doesn't support all RTC features that are accessible
        through ioctls. This means that testing can't discover
        functionality errors related to the third argument of ioctls
        that are used for features which are not supported. For example,
        running the test program for ioctl RTC_EPOCH_READ gives
        the error output: inappropriate ioctl for device. As expected,
        the same output was obtained through QEMU which means that this
        ioctl is recognized in QEMU but doesn't really do anything
        because it is not supported in the host computer's RTC.

        Conclusion: Some RTC ioctls need to be tested on computers
        that support their functionalities so that it can be inferred
        that they are really supported in QEMU. In absence of such
        test hosts, the specifications of those ioctls need to be
        carefully checked manually and the implementations should be
        updated accordingly.

Testing method for sound timer ioctls:

    The alsa ioctl test suite, that can be found on github
    ("https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-utils"), was used the test
    the implemented ioctls. The file "timer.c", located in this test
    suite, contains test functions that are used to test alsa timer
    ioctls. This file was compiled (sometimes using cross-compilers) 
    for the following architectures:

        * Intel 64-bit (little endian)
        * Power pc 32-bit (big endian)
        * Power pc 64-bit (big endian)

    The corresponding compiled test files were executed without using
    QEMU on following hosts:

        * Intel Core i7-4790K (x86_64 host)
        * Power 7447A (ppc32 host)

    The corresponding native compiled test files were executed without using
    QEMU on following hosts:

        * Intel Core i7-4790K (x86_64 host)
        * Power 7447A (ppc32 host)

    All compiled test files were in turn executed through QEMU
    and the results obtained were the same ones gotten for native
    execution.

    Also, mini test programs were written to test further functionalities
    of individual ioctls. Those programs were, like the file "timer.c",
    compiled for different architectures and were executed both natively
    and thgrough QEMU to compare the results.

    Example of a test program:

        For ioctl SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_GINFO the following test program was used:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <fcntl.h>
        #include <sys/ioctl.h>
        #include <sound/asound.h>

        #define ERROR -1

        int main()
        {
            int fd = open("/dev/snd/timer", O_RDWR);

            if(fd == ERROR)
            {
                perror("open");
                return -1;
            }

            struct snd_timer_id id = {SNDRV_TIMER_CLASS_GLOBAL, 
                                      SNDRV_TIMER_SCLASS_NONE, -1, 
                                      SNDRV_TIMER_GLOBAL_SYSTEM, 0};

            struct snd_timer_ginfo ginfo;
            ginfo.tid = id;

            if(ioctl(fd, SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_GINFO, &ginfo) == ERROR)
            {
                perror("ioctl");
                return -1;
            }

            printf("flags: %u\n", ginfo.flags);
            printf("card: %d\n", ginfo.card);
            printf("id: %s\n", ginfo.id);
            printf("name: %s\n", ginfo.name);
            printf("reserved0: %lu\n", ginfo.reserved0);
            printf("resolution: %lu\n", ginfo.resolution);
            printf("resolution_min: %lu\n", ginfo.resolution_min);
            printf("reolution_max: %lu\n", ginfo.resolution_max);
            printf("clients: %u\n", ginfo.clients);
            printf("reserved: %s\n", ginfo.reserved);

            return 0;
        }

v6:

      to recognize two ioctls that are implemented in that patch
