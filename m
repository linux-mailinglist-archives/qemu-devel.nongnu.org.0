From: Aleksandar Markovic <amarkovic@wavecomp.com>

This series is a spin-off of a former "Misc MIPS fixes for 4.2" series.

The goal of the series is to clean up CP0-related code, and prepare
it for (near) future extensions and amendments.

The series is mostly of refactoring nature, however it may contain
simple fixes (for example, fixes for obvious bugs, or additions of
simple subregister handling). The more complex fixes and improvements
(for example, additions of VPE-related functionalities) are, for now,
outside the scope of this series.
