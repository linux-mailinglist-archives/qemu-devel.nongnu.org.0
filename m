I suspect that ultimately we will end up wanting / needing to do
this. As you say, there's no significant downside, and it will
unlock features.

Note there is an issue open about making the application process
simpler:

https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/community-relations/opensource-program/-/epics/18

which could be a reason to not rush into applying immediately
if we don't have an obvious pressing need.

As you say there's no enforcement of CI minutes at all right now
anyway as reported at:

  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/243722

Yep, my key observation is that I don't think the open source program
fully solves the CI minutes problems for projects using a fork'ing
workflow, as the increased minutes only applies for jobs run in the
main repo. Each individual contributor is still limited in their
fork.  Similarly their suggestion that people bring their own
custom runners doesn't really help projects with a forking workflow
as custom runners aren't accessible to forks.

It would be crazy if they enforced limited CI time on public repos
right now, because if any individual contributor runs out of CI
minutes they will be unable to contribute to a project that mandates
succesful CI pipeline, even if the project is in the OSS program.

Hopefully they will come up with a more practical answer to the
forking-workflow problems.

Regards,
Daniel
