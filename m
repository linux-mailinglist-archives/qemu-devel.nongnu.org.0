I think deprecating the extension makes sense only if we can actually
kill it.

We could try to make the extension opt-in, and have only the intermal
users opt in.  Can't say offhand whether that's practical.

Looks like this:

    rsp =3D qdict_from_jsonf_nofail("{ 'error': { 'class': %s, 'desc': %s }=
 }",
                                  QapiErrorClass_str(error_get_class(err)),
                                  error_get_pretty(err));

Without the extension, we'd suffer from a mild case of leaning toothpick
syndrome:

    rsp =3D qdict_from_jsonf_nofail("{ \"error\": { \"class\": %s, \"desc\"=
: %s } }",
                                  QapiErrorClass_str(error_get_class(err)),
                                  error_get_pretty(err));

I intentionally picked an example outside tests/ :)

JSON5 is rather niche, I'm afraid.

Not true; I think you're confusing the QAPI schema parser
scripts/qapi/parser.py with the JSON parser qobject/json-*.[ch].

Quoting json-lexer.c:

 * Extensions over RFC 8259:
 * - Extra escape sequence in strings:
 *   0x27 (apostrophe) is recognized after escape, too
 * - Single-quoted strings:
 *   Like double-quoted strings, except they're delimited by %x27
 *   (apostrophe) instead of %x22 (quotation mark), and can't contain
 *   unescaped apostrophe, but can contain unescaped quotation mark.
 * - Interpolation, if enabled:
 *   The lexer accepts %[A-Za-z0-9]*, and leaves rejecting invalid
 *   ones to the parser.

Makes use of RFC 8259 section 9. Parsers: "A JSON parser MAY accept
non-JSON forms or extensions."

The QAPI schema parser indeed restricts strings to printable ASCII.  The
QAPI schema language is so bastardized, I'm not sure how much RFC 8259
still matters, but if you think it does, then consider section
9. Parsers: "An implementation may set limits on the length and
character contents of strings."

To the best of my knowledge, the JSON parser interprets any valid strict
JSON input in accordance to RFC 8259.  In other words, you don't notice
the extensions unless you use them, or rely on invalid strict JSON to be
rejected.

Peter Luo's input uses one of QEMU's JSON parser's extensions like this:

    "base":'json:{...}'

This is not valid strict JSON.  Libvirt's JSON parser doesn't accept it.

The problem is not presence of extensions in QEMU, it's the use of these
extensions in input for libvirt.  Removing the extensions from QEMU will
not affect the error.  Removing their use from the input will.
