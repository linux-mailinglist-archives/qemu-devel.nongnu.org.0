If you'll note, this case _did_ write an implied backing_fmt=raw into 
the image.  Constrast that with creating an image on a qcow2 backing 
file, which tells you it detected a format of qcow2, but does NOT write 
backing_fmt=qcow2 into the image (this was a change from v2, at Peter's 
request).  Thus, when the backing is raw, we warn but future use of the 
image is now safe where it previously was not; when the backing file is 
non-raw, we warn but do not change our behavior, but because the backing 
file is non-raw any future probes will not be any less safe than before.

We have an image with no backing format, so we had to probe.  This patch 
series did not change the behavior of opening an existing image, only 
for creating a new image (or amending an image in-place).  So the lack 
of a warning on opening the unsafe image may be desirable, but it would 
be via even more patches.

Ouch - you are creating a qcow2 destination file named 'flattened.raw', 
which is rather confusing on your part.

However, as your destination file is being created without a backing 
image, it is to be expected that there is no warning (when there is no 
backing file, -F makes no sense).  To provoke the warning during 
convert, you'll have to also pass -B (or -o backing_file), without -o 
backing_fmt (since convert lacks the -F shorthand).

Could do, right before 'To avoid the warning'.
