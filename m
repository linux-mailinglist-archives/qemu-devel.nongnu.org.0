Andreas was so kind to try kenels 4.4, 4.15 and 5.6 all fail (with qemu 4.2)
He then tried Eoan (qemu 4.0) and Focal (qemu 4.2).
4.0 worked and 4.2 failed.

We will set up a bisect run on Monday and hopefully find the offending
change.

@David - I agree that the messages might be a red-herring, but to be
sure was that fix between 4.0 and 4.2?

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
