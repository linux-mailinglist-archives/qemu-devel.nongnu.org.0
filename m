If SYS_OPEN is supposed to call fopen (i didn't actually know that..) 
then it does make more sense for binary/text mode to be propagated from 
guest. Qemu's implementation calls open(2) though, which is not correct 
at all then. Well, as long as qemu does that, there is no 
posix-compliant way to tell open(2) if it should use binary or text 
mode, there is no notion of that as far as posix (and most 
implementations) is concerned. My change then acts as a way to at least 
have predictable behavior across platforms, but i guess a more correct 
approach would be to follow actual semi-hosting spec and switch to fopen.
