* So far issue reports have mostly been unencrypted.

* All issue reports may not need encryption.

* If someone still wants to send an encrypted report, few contacts with their 
  GPG keys could be made available, as is available now.

| 
| Yes, please discuss the reasons for wanting a mailing list:
| 
| Is the goal to involve more people in triaging CVEs in a timely manner?

  This will be welcome for fix patches.

| Is the goal to include new people who have recently asked to participate?

  We've not received such request yet.

| Is the goal to use an easier workflow than manually sending encrypted
| email to a handful of people?

* Current proposal is more for enabling communities and downstream distros to 
  know about the issues as and when they are reported. Ie. heads-up mechanism.

  Just to note, we've not received any request for such notifications.

* If maintainers are on this list, that could help with the triage and fix 
  patches.


Thank you.
