FWIW, when I wrote that my intention was *not* to exclude the bleeding
edge distro development branches.

Obviously we can break on those distros at any time as they're moving
targets, but IMHO we should treat bugs as we would for any other
released distros and aim to fix them promptly when bugs occurr.
