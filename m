Also, it moves onboard devices from /machine/unattached/ to
/machine/peripheral-anon/.

I really regard it as a work-around, not a proper solution.

Thus, we satisfy bus_unparent()'s precondition "bus children have a QOM
parent"[*] by moving "add to parent bus" next to the place where we
ensure "has QOM parent" by putting orphans under /machine/unattached/.
Makes sense.

If we add to the bus first, the precondition ceases to hold until we
realize.  Ugly, but harmless unless we manage to actually call the
function then.

I suspect we can't realize first, because the realize method may want to
use the parent bus.

We could lift putting orphans under /machine/unattached from
device_set_realized() into those callers that don't already assign a QOM
parent.  Possibly hundreds of places, hmm.

We could factor it out into a helper, and call it right before we add to
the parent bus.  Orphans with a parent bus would get adopted ealier,
orphans without one would still get adopted at realize time.

I'll play with it.
