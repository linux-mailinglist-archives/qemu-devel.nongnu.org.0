Well, I think what data to transmit during migration is the duty of qemu 
not kernel. And I suspect the idea of reading opaque data (with version) 
from kernel and transmit them to dest is the best approach.

Yes, that looks pretty complicated.

I'm not sure whether the above flexibility can work better than encoding 
them to mdev type. If we really want ultra flexibility, we need making 
the compatibility check totally vendor specific.

Then it's actually a subclass of mdev I guess in the future.

Thanks
