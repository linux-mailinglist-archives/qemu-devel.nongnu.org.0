Thanks for pushing me deeper into nexuses!
You're right, you can map from one type to another.
However, you cannot handle the "double inversion" of an ACTIVE_LOW
signal with a physical inverter added:

        nexus: led-nexus {
                #gpio-cells = <2>;
                gpio-map = <0 0 &gpio2 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,     // inverted
                           <1 0 &gpio2 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,    // noninverted
                           <2 0 &gpio2 21 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;     // inverted
                gpio-map-mask = <3 0>;
                // default gpio-map-pass-thru = <0 0>;
        };

        leds {
                compatible = "gpio-leds";
                led6-inverted {
                        gpios = <&nexus 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                };
                led7-noninverted {
                        gpios = <&nexus 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                };
                led8-double-inverted {  // FAILS: still inverted
                        gpios = <&nexus 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                };
        };

It "works" if the last entry in gpio-map is changed to GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.
Still, the consumer would see the final translated polarity, and not the
actual one it needs to program the consumer for.

As per your suggestion in "Re: [PATCH V4 2/2] gpio: inverter: document
the inverter bindings"?
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/CAL_JsqLp___2O-naU+2PPQy0QmJX6+aN3hByz-OB9+qFvWgN9Q@mail.gmail.com/

Oh, now I understand. I was misguided by Harish' interpretation
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/dde73334-a26d-b53f-6b97-4101c1cdc185@mentor.com/
which assumed an "inverted" property, e.g.

    inverted = /bits/ 8 <0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>;

But you actually meant a new GPIO_INVERTED flag, to be ORed into the 2nd
cell of a GPIO specifier? I.e. add to include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h"

    /* Bit 6 expresses the presence of a physical inverter */
    #define GPIO_INVERTED 64

We need to be very careful in defining to which side the GPIO_ACTIVE_*
applies to (consumer?), and which side the GPIO_INVERTED flag (provider?).
Still, this doesn't help if e.g. a FET is used instead of a push-pull
inverter, as the former needs translation of other flags (which the
nexus can do, the caveats above still applies, though).

Same for adding IRQ_TYPE_INVERTED.

Related issue: how to handle physical inverters on SPI chip select lines,
if the SPI slave can be configured for both polarities?

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
