So you mean just polling the @bs for which a caller gave poll=3Dtrue unti=
l
the counter reaches 0?  I=E2=80=99ll try, sounds good (if I can get it to=

If it=E2=80=99s just an int pointer, there=E2=80=99s no point in having t=

suppose.

Well, I=E2=80=99m glad if test-bdrv-drain just keeps working. :-)

I=E2=80=99ll try.
