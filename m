What other problems? Sure we need the caller to unref.

The vug_source_new() function.

Using the hashtable shouldn't be necessary, as VugDev will handle the
attach/detach of the socket FD.

The hashtable is meant for VuDev callback.

Sure we can add the socket to the hashtable, but it's better to avoid
since we can.
