There are a couple of per-arch hacks in the main TCG cpu loops it would
be good to excise from the code.

tlb_flush and friends are TCG implementation details for softmmu that
ensure a lookup for any address will always return to a guest specific
tlb_fill to rebuild the cache. The behaviour is not guest-specific
per-se although we do partition the table entries based on the guest
size.

Perhaps we can make it more dynamic but it would have to ensure both the
slow path and the fast path are using the same mask and shifts when
walking the table.

The user-mode run loops are a whole separate chunk of code. I don't know
if it is worth trying to make them plugable as you will only ever have
one per linux-user binary.

Although there are several different run loops in there I think they
share a lot of commonality which is why they are bundled together. They
all share the same backend for dealing with ioevents and generic
pause/unpause machinery. But feel free to prove me wrong ;-)

There are certainly some ugly bits we could shave down in such an
exercise.

Maybe - certainly for TCG you have pretty much lost if you have exited
the main execution loop I doubt it would show up much. Not so sure about
the HW accelerators. Most of the performance sensitive stuff is dealt
with close to the ioctls IIRC.

For linux-user each CPU run loop is it's own special snowflake because
pretty much every architecture has it's own special set of EXCP_ exits
to deal with various bits. There are per-arch EXCP_ flags for system
emulation as well but not nearly as many.
