Yes, absolutely this is what I wanted to express.

I would like to find out what the problem is that appears in s390,
I am not sure though that it is actually an s390-specific problem, it could even be a migration qemu-file issue,
as apparently just flushing with qemu_fflush(f) "fixes" it.

My patch made the stream a bit smaller, and changed the layout of the s390-skeys, which have an interesting field length (32768),
I wonder if I got just the right alignment to trigger a bug where the qemu-file buffer is not properly flushed.

We will come back to this later, thanks a lot for the exchange!

Ciao,
