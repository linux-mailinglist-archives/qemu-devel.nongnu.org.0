Rather than using a TCP port, is it worth mentioning that you can use
a Unix socket?  If the point of this is local access to the disk
contents, that feels a bit lighter weight.

This defaults to a readonly image; you may want to include
"writable":true in the JSON, especially if the purpose is to show how
to modify guest-visible contents of an at-rest disk image.

If you do choose to rewrite to use a Unix socket, it would change this
to nbd+unix:///guest-disk?socket=/path/to/sock.

And if you favor Unix sockets, you'd want to do it for q-s-d as well.
Okay, keeping it as TCP is easy enough (or maybe just a mention that
Unix sockets can be used, while giving a pointer to other
documentation for the interested reader).

Overall a nice post!  I hope my comments help in addition to all the
other good reviews you got.
