In general this looks good: certainly I don't see any reason why the tesseract_ocr 
helper changes shouldn't be merged, since I expect that this is something that will 
be used more in future.

Looking at the fuloong test it seems that it stops fairly early in the kernel boot: 
one of the problems that Zoltan's VIA southbridge patches were trying to solve 
earlier in the year was because of problems with PCI IRQ routing, so it would be nice 
to include a small OS image that can be used to boot to userspace to ensure that such 
problems can be detected in future.


ATB,

Mark.
