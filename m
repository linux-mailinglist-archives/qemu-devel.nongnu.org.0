>=20

The 'several disabled one active' semantics _heavily_ depend on metadata
which must be tracked outside of qemu and is more prone to break. If any
of the intermediate bitmaps is broken or missing everything breaks.

Then there's the complexity of the code which handles merging of the
bitmaps during block jobs. Jobs such as blockdev-mirror in full mode and
block-commit squash together the data and we need to do something about
the bitmaps for the backups to work properly afterwards.

Without considering overlays which were created without propagating
bitmaps, the code was already getting hairy especially in the case of
backups where we needed to stitch together bitmaps for all the bitmaps
corresponding to the given point in time where the backup is taken from.

When we add overlays without any bitmaps into the mix the code for
resolving which bitmaps to merge the code is becoming very unpleasant,
hard to understand and maintain and that is the main point for the
switch.

I don't want to add unnecessary complexity to the libvirt code which
will make it more fragile or hard to understand and fix in the future.

Both points which I heard for now (performance, and backup granularity
in case of non-default qcow2 block size) don't seem compelling enough to
me to make my life of implementing the feature in libvirt so much
harder.

Also users really can just remove the point in time they wish to backup
from after a successful backup which will also remove the corresponding
active bitmap.

It's not only a "user forgot" thing, but more that a systemic change
would be required.

Additionally until _very_ recently it wasn't possible to create bitmaps
using qemu-img, which made it impossible to create overlays for inactive
VMs. Arguably this has changed so we could require it. It still adds a
moving part which can break if the user doesn't add the bitmap or
requires yet another special case handling if we want to compensate for
that.

As of such, in libvirt's tech-preview implementation that is present
currently upstream, if you create a qcow2 overlay without adding the
appropriate bitmaps, the backups simply won't work.

> What do you think of granularity? We in Virtuozzo use 1M cluster as a def=

 have smaller incremental backups. So, this is advantage of creating bitmap=
 over relaying on block-status capturing by block-dirty-bitmap-populate: yo=
u don't control dirtiness granularity. So, I think that bitmap propagation,=
 or just creating new dirty bitmap to track dirtiness from start of new sna=
pshot is better.

This is a valid argument. Backups in this scenario will be bigger. I
still don't feel like the code needs to be made much more complex
because of it though.

In some previous replies to Kevin, we discussed that it might be worth
optimizing 'block-dirty-bitmap-populate' to directly populate the bits
in the target bitmap rather than after the job is complete, so
efectively directly mering it. I probably described it wrong here.

>Do you mean that populating directly into target bitmap is not really need=
ed?

I need the bitmap populated by 'block-dirty-bitmap-populate' to be
merged into multiple bitmaps in the new semantics. If the job itself
doesn't support that sematics, changing it to just to directly populate
one bitmap doesn't seem to be worth it since I'll be using intermediate
bitmaps anyways.
