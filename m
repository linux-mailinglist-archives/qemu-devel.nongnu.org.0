Is the protocol that the user writes start_pfn/page_size/total_pfns in
any order and then the read of copied_pfns is what triggers the
snapshot?  Are start_pfn/page_size/total_pfns sticky such that a user
can write them once and get repeated refreshes of the dirty bitmap by
re-reading copied_pfns?  What's the advantage to returning -1 versus
returning copied_pfns == total_pfns?

If the user then wants to switch back to reading device migration
state, is it a read of data_size that switches the data area back to
making that address space available?  In each case, is it the user's
responsibility to consume all the data provided before triggering the
next data area?  For example, if I ask for a range of dirty bitmap, the
vendor driver will provide that range and and clear it, such that the
pages are considered clean regardless of whether the user consumed the
data area.  Likewise if the user asks for data_size, that would be
deducted from pending_bytes regardless of the user reading the data
area.  Are there any read side-effects to pending_bytes?  Are there
read side-effects to the data area on SAVING?  Are there write
side-effects on RESUMING, or is it only the write of data_size that
triggers the buffer to be consumed?  Is it the user's responsibility to
write only full "packets" on RESUMING?  For example if the SAVING side
provides data_size X, that full data_size X must be written to the
RESUMING side, the user cannot write half of it to the data area on the
RESUMING side, write data_size with X/2, write the second half, and
again write X/2.  IOW, the data_size "packet" is indivisible at the
point of resuming.

What are the ordering requirements?  Must the user write data_size
packets in the same order that they're read, or is it the vendor
driver's responsibility to include sequence information and allow
restore in any order?

We need to be careful with how this is used if we want to leave the
possibility of using the remaining 29 bits of this register.  Maybe we
want to define VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_MASK and be sure that we only do
read-modify-write ops within the mask (ex. set_bit and clear_bit
helpers).  Also, above we define STOPPED to indicate simply
not-RUNNING, but here it seems STOPPED means not-RUNNING, not-SAVING,
and not-RESUMING.

Placing the data more than 4GB into the region seems a bit absurd, so
this could probably be a __u32 and take the place of the reserved field.

If this is signed so that we can get -1 then the user could
theoretically specify total_pfns that we can't represent in
copied_pfns.  Probably best to use unsigned and specify ~0 rather than
-1.

Overall this looks like a good interface, but we need to more
thoroughly define the protocol with the data area and set expectations
we're placing on the user and vendor driver.  There should be no usage
assumptions, it should all be spelled out.  Thanks,

Alex
