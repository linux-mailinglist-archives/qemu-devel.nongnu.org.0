Presumably the VIA southbridge has its own internal pair of cascaded 8259s so the IRQ
line from the drive is connected to IRQ14/15 as per an typical ISA PC. You can see
this in the "Common Hardware Reference Platform: I/O Device Reference" PDF section 4.1.

But that is exactly what is happening! The comment above clearly indicates the
firmware incorrectly sets the IDE controller in native mode which is in exact
agreement with the trace you provide below. And in fact if you look at
https://www.powerdeveloper.org/platforms/pegasos/devicetree you can see the nvramrc
hack that was released in order to fix the device tree to boot Linux which alters the
class-code and sets interrupts to 14 (which I believe is invalid, but seemingly good
enough here).

Again to summarise: this is a known bug in Pegasos2 firmware and the VIA is a
standard chip, so let's try and figure out exactly what is happening using a real
firmware and emulate that behaviour in QEMU. This should then make all guests happy,
regardless of architecture, without requiring the introduction of feature bits or
risk of introducing other incompatibilities.
