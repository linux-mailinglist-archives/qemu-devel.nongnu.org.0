So first rule is.

:prefix:all::user.virtiofs.:

scope="all"
key==""
prepend="user.virtiofs."

Given scope, rule applies to both client and server. Given key is "",
any income setxattr() request will be prefixed with "user.virtiofs".
And how does this rule work for server (listxattr()). It will match
prepend "user.virtiofs" and if that matches it will be stripped?

Ok, so if an xattr does not match first rule, then second rule says
key="", prepend="" and that will match all xattrs. So anything which
is not caught by first rule, will be caught by second rule and
either rejected or filtered out.

Ok.

Ok. Got it. I am wondering how will I specify these rules so that
they work in nested configuration. Say I have L0 host, L1 guest and
L2 guest. Say virtiofsd0 is running on L0 and virtiofsd1 is running
on L1. 

I am wondering how will I specify the rules on virtiofsd0 and virtiofsd1
so that it works. Will it be same or rules are level dependent.

Right. We don't want unpriviliged process to be able to setup
user.virtiofs.trusted.*. But that's what precisely happen in
a nested configuration.

In above example, L2 will set trusted.foo, virtiofsd1 wil convert it
to user.virtiofs.trusted.foo and virtiofsd0 will reject it, breaking
the nested virtiofs.

Thanks
