Richard had comments on PATCH 02+03.  Should I expect v4?

I'm asking because my '[PATCH v4 00/29] Tame a few "touch this,
recompile the world" headers' is ready, and I want to post the pull
request before it goes stale.  If this series is also ready, I can do
both together.  Else, it'll needs a rebase onto mine (one conflict,
resolving it necessitates a commit message update).
