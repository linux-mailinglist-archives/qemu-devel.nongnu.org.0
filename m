I'm currently trying to understand if my multi-phase reset series has
some interference with this new mechanism and I have some question.

IIUC when migration starts. the vfio-pci device is partially unplugged
using failover_unplug_primary():

And if migration fails this same device is plugged back using
failover_replug_primary():

My concern is about the qdev_set_parent_bus() call above (because I
touch this function in my series) and don't want to have side effects there.

I looked at the code and thought the partial unplug has the effect of
cutting off the unplug procedure just before doing the qdev real unplug.
In pcie_unplug_device() we return before doing the object_unparent():
> static void pcie_unplug_device(PCIBus *bus, PCIDevice *dev, ...

>      hotplug_handler_unplug(hotplug_ctrl, DEVICE(dev), &error_abort);
>      object_unparent(OBJECT(dev));
>  }

From my understanding, object_unparent() is the only way to really
unplug a device from a bus regarding qdev (and it also unrealizes the
device). So I have the feeling that qdev_set_parent_bus() here is a
no-op (because primary_dev is already on primary_bus).

Am I wrong ? Is there any other cases I missed where the primary_dev is
not already on the primary_bus when failover_replug_primary() is called ?
