I think the disconnect is that these sorts of extensions don't reflect
things that a physical device can actually do.  The idea of vfio is
that it's a userspace driver interface.  It provides a channel for the
user to interact with the device, map device resources, receive
interrupts, map system memory through the iommu, etc.  Mediated devices
augment this by replacing the physical device the user accesses with a
software virtualized device.  So then the question becomes why this
device virtualizing software, ie. the mdev vendor driver, needs to do
things that a physical device clearly cannot do.  For example, how can
a physical device write-protect portions of system memory?  Or even,
why would it need to?  It makes me suspect that mdev is being used to
bypass the hypervisor, or maybe fill in the gaps for hardware that
isn't as "mediation friendly" as it claims to be.

In the case of a physical device discovering an iova translation, this
is what device iotlbs are for, but as an acceleration and offload
mechanism for the system iommu rather than a lookup mechanism as seems
to be wanted here.  If we had a system iommu with dirty page tracking,
I believe that tracking would live in the iommu page tables and
therefore reflect dirty pages relative to iova.  We'd need to consume
those dirty page bits before we tear down the iova mappings, much like
we're suggesting QEMU do here.

Unfortunately I also think that KVM and vhost are not really the best
examples of what we need to do for vfio.  KVM is intimately involved
with GPAs, so clearly dirty page tracking at that level is not an
issue.  Vhost tends to circumvent the viommu; it's trying to poke
directly into guest memory without the help of a physical iommu.  So
I can't say that I have much faith that QEMU is already properly wired
with respect to viommu and dirty page tracking, leaving open the
possibility that a log_sync on iommu region unmap is simply a gap in
the QEMU migration story.  The vfio migration interface we have on the
table seems like it could work, but QEMU needs an update and we need to
define the interface in terms of pfns relative to the address space.

If GPAs are still needed, what are they for?  The write-protect example
is clearly a hypervisor level interaction as I assume it's write
protection relative to the vCPU.  It's a hypervisor specific interface
to perform that write-protection, so why wouldn't we use a hypervisor
specific interface to collect the data to perform that operation?
IOW, if GVT-g already has a KVM dependency, why be concerned about
adding another GVT-g KVM dependency?  It seems like vfio is just a
potentially convenient channel, but as discussed above, vfio has no
business in GPAs because devices don't operate on GPAs and I've not
been sold that there's value in vfio getting involved in that address
space.  Convince me otherwise ;)  Thanks,

Alex
