Not sure if my problem I see on other machine emulation I'm working on is 
related at all but there's a possibility it might be. I got this with 
different arch (ppc but could also reproduce something similar with mips) 
and ide controller emulation (via-ide) but the PCI bmdma code is shared by 
CMD646, via-ide and sii3112 and also the ide-cdrom emulation is the same 
so if there's a bug in these that could cause similar problems for 
different components. Or it could be that we get similar symptoms due to 
different reasons in which case sorry for the distracion but maybe we can 
learn from the experience of each other even in that case.

What I get is tracked here:

https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/ticket/38949

(background on emulated machine: https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/wiki/SubprojectPegasos2 )

Originally I had both Linux and MorphOS fail after enabling BMDMA before I 
had interrupt controller emulation (so that means it could be a problem 
with that in your case as well so something to check). Now that I've 
implemented interrupts Linux boots with DMA from CDROM but MorphOS is 
still not happy. You saw OpenBSD work but Solaris not so that could be 
similar in case the drivers do something differently or one relies on 
something the other does not care about. It could also be that since Linux 
is working, BMDMA and/or ide-cdrom may not emulate something other drivers 
may need which could cause simlar problems on multiple archs/emulations 
but I could be wrong about that.

An advice I got before to debug this is to try enabling ide traces:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-03/msg05656.html

I've tried that but lacking detailed knowledge about ide controllers I 
could not make much sense of the results so far.

Not sure how much help this is but maybe if more people are looking at it 
we might find something out. I've cc'd the IDE maintainer in case he has 
something more useful to add.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
