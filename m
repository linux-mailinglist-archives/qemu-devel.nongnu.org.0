We have a tests/bench-crypto-hash test but its hardcoded for sha256.
I hacked it to report all algorithms and got these results for varying
input chunk sizes:

IOW, md5 is clearly the quickest, by a considerable margin over
SHA256/512. SHA1 is slightly slower.

Assuming that we document that this command is intentionally
*not* trying to guarantee collision resistances we're ok.

In fact we should not document what kind of checksum is
reported by query-memory-checksum. The impl should be a black
box from user's POV.

If we're just aiming for debugging tool to detect accidental
corruption, could we even just ignore cryptographic hashs
entirely and do a crc32 - that'd be way faster than even
md5.

Daniel
