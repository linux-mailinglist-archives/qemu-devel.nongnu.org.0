We can get rid of CPUClass::cpu_class_by_name() without changing
the external interfaces provided by QEMU.

I don't have a strong opinion about using only QOM types at -cpu,
yet.  But first we need to get rid of the arch-specific CPU model
name exceptions enumerated at the URL above (which would be very
welcome).
