Dear Phil,

As you can see, the board ids are quite controversial, and bcm2837 is
not listed at all. Therefore 0xc44 is just a constant to identify qemu
"board". Feel free to change the id if you'd like.

About the r1 register, you've liked the wrong firmware. That's for
AArch32 mode, not for AArch64 mode which the raspi3 machine type uses.
In AArch64 mode, the firmware
https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/blob/920c7ed2ee/armstubs/armstub8.S
passes only the device tree pointer in x0 and only for the primary
CPU, no board id of any kind.

Yes I know that the real firmware can start a hw raspi3 board in 32
bit mode, but it's better to have 64 bit as default, as raspi2 is 32
bit only anyway. Unfortunately there's no way to autodetect if the
image passed to the -kernel argument was compiled for AArch32 or
AArch64 mode, the instructions are way to similarly encoded and
there's no magic in raw binaries. Real hw board differentiates by
checking the file name of the kernel file on the boot partition (named
kernel7.img vs. kernel8.img) and parsing config.txt for arm specific
options. This is not an option for qemu as it does not emulate VC GPU
bootcode nor does it receive an entire boot partition with the -kernel
argument. Another reason to use AArch64 for raspi3 machine is if a
real board finds both kernel7.img and kernel8.img on the boot
partition, then it will load the AArch64 kernel.

Cheers,
bzt
