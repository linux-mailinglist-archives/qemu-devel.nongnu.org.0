It's definitely me taking the cowardly way out. I did use the exact QEMU 
version in the last spin, because that seemed like the dumbest thing :)

I think qemu.machine would eventually evolve to track the QEMU version 
directly, whereas qemu.qmp would evolve to keep its own independent 
versioning system.

This is just, I guess, one more semantic nudge towards the idea that 
this is really an independent little component. I just want to give it 
some more time in the oven before I declare it truly and genuinely 
supported as its own project. Once it's on PyPI, I am beholden to more 
than the other QEMU contributors. Satisfying both crowds simultaneously 
seems like it will be tough.
