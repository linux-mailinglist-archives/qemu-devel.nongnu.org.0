Yes, this was definitely the idea I had in mind when I suggested that
bdrv_co_delete_file() should take a BDS.

And I think the callers that want to call this function (for failures
during image creation) all already have a BDS pointer, so nobody will
actually need the additional open.

const char *filename only works for the local filesystem (and even then
I think not for all filenames) and some URLs, so this is not what we
want to have in a public interface to identify an image file.
