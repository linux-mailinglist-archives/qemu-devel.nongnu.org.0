Hi, Peter.

Thanks for the helpfully detailed response.  I realized some of the
missing bits due to the Patchew failure and as I look closer into your
patch for qemu-block-drivers.rst.

Ah, noted.  I used the regular :: out of habit from elsewhere, and
didn't even look at the details of qemu-block-drivers.rst.
