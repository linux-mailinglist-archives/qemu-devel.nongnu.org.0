The first sentence makes me expect we'll move these bits to the better
place.  The second then tells me we drop them, without giving a reason.

Suggest:

   Since commit 3264ffced3 (v4.2.0), we have a better place to tell
   users about deprecated and deleted functionality --
   qemu-deprecated.texi.  These "dropped in" remarks all predate it, and
   other feature drops of that vintage are not documented anywhere, so
   moving these to qemu-deprecated.texi makes little sense.  Drop them
   instead.

With something like that
