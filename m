I think we can go with 1a. (See Danial's comment)

Can we simply use dynamic linking here?

I think we need to care about compatibility. E.g we need to enable BTF 
so I don't know how hard if we add BTF support in the current design. It 
would be probably OK it's not a lot of effort.

Yes, let's go 3a for upstream.

We can go with LE first.
