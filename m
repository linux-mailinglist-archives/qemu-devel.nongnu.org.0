OK.  What if we exclude mediated devices?  Its appears they are the only
ones where the kernel may async'ly use the vaddr, via call chains ending in 
vfio_iommu_type1_pin_pages or vfio_iommu_type1_dma_rw_chunk.

The other functions that use dma->vaddr are
    vfio_dma_do_map 
    vfio_pin_map_dma 
    vfio_iommu_replay 
    vfio_pin_pages_remote
and they are all initiated via userland ioctl (if I have traced all the code 
paths correctly).  Thus iommu->lock would protect them.

We would block live update in qemu if the config includes a mediated device.

VFIO_IOMMU_REMAP_DMA would return EINVAL if the container has a mediated device.

That sounds useful when devices support.  Can you give me some function names
or references so I can study this qemu-based "vfio migration interface".

Yes, true of this remap proposal.

I wanted to unconditionally support all devices, which is why I think that

MADV_DOEXEC is a nifty solution.  If you agree, please add your voice to the

lkml discussion.

My existing code is apparently deficient in this area; I close the pre-exec eventfd,
and post exec create a new eventfd and attach it to the vfio device.  Jason and I
are discussing alternatives in this thread of the series:
  https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/0da862c8-74bc-bf06-a436-4ebfcb9dd8d4@oracle.com/

I am hoping that unconditionally injecting a (potentially spurious) interrupt on a 
new eventfd after exec will solve the problem.

BTW, thanks for discussing these issues.  I appreciate it.
