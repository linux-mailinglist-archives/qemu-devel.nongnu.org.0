	Cross-VM is not a lot different from networking.  You can=E2=80=99=
t
use AF_UNIX; and AF_VSOCK and AF_INET do not support FD passing.
You=E2=80=99d either have to add FD passing to AF_VSOCK, which will have
some security issues, or fall back to message passing that will
degrade performance.  You can skip the byte ordering issues, however,
when it=E2=80=99s the same host.
