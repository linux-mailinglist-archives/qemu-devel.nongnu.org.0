Why do we even need to use 'yank' on the receive side ? Until migration
has switched over from src to dst, the receive side is discardable and
the whole process can just be teminated with kill(SIGTERM/SIGKILL).

On the source side 'yank' is needed, because the QEMU process is still
running the live workload and thus is precious and mustn't be killed.

Daniel
