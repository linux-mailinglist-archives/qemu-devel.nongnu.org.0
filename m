Well, I don't know if there is a good method for transversal patchsets=20
like this one. I guess it depends on the area.=20

The overall merging process became more complex that expected after our=20
three simple patchsets (Yours, Joel's and mine) collided.=20

It's not a big issue. We have time to provide fixes before 4.1 is out.=20
Let's put some energy to move on and get code merged.

Peter,=20

do you want me to resend with only the two first patches and include=20
Joel's in the same series ? I would leave out the part Philippe is=20
covering in his object_initialize_child() patchset.

Thanks,

C.
