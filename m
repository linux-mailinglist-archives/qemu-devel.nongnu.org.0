So that is expecting, since the qemu packages version 1:2.11+dfsg-
1ubuntu7 were initially used - the GA version, that's not known to work
- the needed patch came later.

The first qemu packages that should be good are the ones with version 1:2.1=
1+dfsg-1ubuntu7.7.
But (after discussing with cpaelzer) the qemu packages didn't really change=
d since 1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.7, I thought that I now upgrade to the latest =
ones (1:2.11+dfsg-1ubuntu7.22):

$ sudo apt install qemu-block-extra qemu-kvm qemu-system-common qemu-system=

And with that the Commissioning worked and ended correctly,
and I was also able to complete a Deployment afterwards.

I deployed 19.04 (disco, since I think that Sean faced the issue while
he tried to deploy disco, too) and it worked. The system (vm1) came up
and I was able to login:

$ ssh ubuntu@192.168.122.201 =

Title:
  [2.6] Unable to reboot s390x KVM machine after initial deploy

Status in MAAS:
  New
Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  MAAS version: 2.6.1 (7832-g17912cdc9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1)
  Arch: S390x

  Appears that MAAS can not find the s390x bootloader to boot from the
  disk, not sure how maas determines this.  However this was working in
  the past. I had originally thought that if the maas machine was
  deployed then it defaulted to boot from disk.

  If I force the VM to book from disk, the VM starts up as expected.

  Reproduce:

  - Deploy Disco on S390x KVM instance
  - Reboot it

  on the KVM console...
