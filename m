Hi Thanos, this looks great, I just had some minor questions below.

Is it valid for an unrelated server->client message to appear in between a
client->server request/reply, or not? And vice versa? Either way, seems useful
for the spec to say.

Is it valid to re-use an ID? When/when not?

I'm not quite following why we need a bit flag and an error field. Do you
anticipate a failure, but with errno==0?

It seems quite unlikely but this should specify it's strings not floating point
values maybe?

Definitely applies to max_fds too.

Could specify the meaning when absent?

By array I presume you mean associative array i.e. an Object. Does the whole
thing look like this:

 {
   "major": ..
   "minor": ..
   "capabilities": {
      "max_fds": ..,
      "migration
   }
 }

or something else?

I'm curious if there was a specific reason it's this way around, when it seems
more natural for the client to propose first, and the server to reply?

Huge nit, but why are these DMA_*MAP when vfio uses *MAP_DMA ?

Should this clarify it does *not* include the bitmap header in its size, unlike
other size fields?

"Each mappable region entry" ?

I'm finding this makes the sizing a bit confusing between map and unmap, could
we may be separate them out, and always define a vfio_bitmap slot for unmap?

Also, shouldn't the client expect sizeof (header) + (nr_table_entries_in_request
* (each vfio_bitmap's size))  in the server's response?

Does the reply header size field reflect this?

"write to client memory"?

Nit, "DIRTY"
