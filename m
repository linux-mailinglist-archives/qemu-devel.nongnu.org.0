I think that=E2=80=99s for two reasons:

(1) The time line in the block layer is unfortunately apparently
different from what you=E2=80=99re used to.  Or, rather, fortunately for =
you.
It isn=E2=80=99t too rare for me to have patches up for a year or more.

(2) We=E2=80=99ve had discussions on this before and the result was alway=
s the
same.  Yes, we=E2=80=99d like to run the iotests as part of make check, b=
ut we
can=E2=80=99t imagine it would work right now (where =E2=80=9Cright now=E2=
=80=9D is whenever we
have the discussion).

So as for me, I felt bad about plainly saying =E2=80=9Cno=E2=80=9D.  But =
I cannot say
=E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D either.  You=E2=80=99re right that I should=E2=80=99=
ve said something.  There are
more words than =E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cno=E2=80=9D.  Sorry ag=
ain.

I can imagine I had hoped Kevin would speak up (and thus take
responsibility) or you=E2=80=99d become so annoyed with our silence that =
you=E2=80=99d
angrily reach out to us and I=E2=80=99d have to do something.  (Which is =
a
horrible attitude, I realize that.)
I do remember that I didn=E2=80=99t expect that you=E2=80=99d just find s=
omeone else to
merge the patch.  That took me by surprise.

Well, I won=E2=80=99t be at KVM Forum, unfortunately.

I know that one never knows which test turns out to be unstable next.

OK.  Maybe someone else will step up once they see the patch.

Or can we have some middle ground?  Something that runs on some CI
systems (and notifies me and others) but won=E2=80=99t result in pull req=
uests
being rejected or cause make check failures?
