They also do it on their internal tests, but I guess that's because
they want to ensure those tests run with the currently compiled
version of libgcrypt (and not the installed package).

However the info file does make it clear that it's the needed version
not the current version.  The example from the info file is:

       /* Version check should be the very first call because it
          makes sure that important subsystems are initialized.
          #define NEED_LIBGCRYPT_VERSION to the minimum required version. */
       if (!gcry_check_version (NEED_LIBGCRYPT_VERSION))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "libgcrypt is too old (need %s, have %s)\n",
              NEED_LIBGCRYPT_VERSION, gcry_check_version (NULL));
           exit (2);
         }
