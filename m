PART I should not be that difficult. PART II is, however, a minefield. An
implementation of support of a ioctl range from 15 minutes to two months.
The least we wont to happen is that the student is stuck with a problem for
months. Therefore I suggest first some "low hanging fruit" for a student to
get self-confidence and experience. One such group is DM ioctl group ( link
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/dm-ioctl.h#L251>
) (Laurent may confirm, or "unconfirm" that). The next shoudl be something
a little harder, but useful in terms of end user. PART III should be
developed on the fly, but we need to provide a guideline/framework prior to
starting working with a student, IMHO..

Great! I'll try. A very interesting site and method.
