It is slightly tedious, but I was pointed at

  https://scc.suse.com/api/package_search/products

where you find the product ID.

eg SLES 15  is ID 1609

which you can plug into

https://scc.suse.com/api/package_search/packages?product_id=1609&amp;query=python

and that somes some package names like "libpython3_6" so 3.6.5
looks like a match,

This looks like it matches openSUSE Leap 15, which suggest we
probably don't need to look at SLES directly.


SLES 15 was released in July 2018, so with our 2 year overlap for the
previous release, we can consider SLES 12sp2 unsupported from this
release cycle.

Daniel
