Hi, Alex,

The "continue" was there only because I wanted to skip updating remote
IRR and so on, considering that it won't be useful after all if the
userspace irqchip is bypassed here.  However I totally overlooked the
fact that this exact IRQ can be shared by another device that is using
the same IRQ while it was not bypassed by the kernel instead.

Here's my guess on what should have happened...

  - The first IRQ of the virtio-blk device will work, which will set
    IRR bit, and at last it'll also set remote-irr of the IRQ, showing
    that it's in service

  - When the virtio-blk wants to EOI the irq, it noticed that it's
    registered with resamplefd (which is actually the nic's rather
    than the virtio-blk device), then it ignored the update to
    remote-irr assuming that it'll always be zero (but actually it's
    just set).

  - When the virtio-blk wants to send further IRQs (starting from the
    2nd one), it will try to set irr again, but this time since the
    remote-irr is still set, it'll ignore the interrupt because it
    thought the IRQ is still in service (while it's not).  This
    corresponds to where "coalesce=3D=3Dtrue" in ioapic_service():

        if (coalesce) {
                /* We are level triggered interrupts, and the
                * guest should be still working on previous one,
                * so skip it. */
                continue;
        }

With that, I think your proposed solution should be the right fix,
that we should still keep the whole IOAPIC EOI path even if the IRQ is
registered with resamplefd, because that can be used by the other device.

I'll also test this senario tomorrow.

Thanks!
