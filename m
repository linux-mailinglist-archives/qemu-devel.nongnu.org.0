Hi all,

We found that the guest will be soft-lockup occasionally when live migratin=
g a 60 vCPU,
512GiB huge page and memory sensitive VM. The reason is clear, almost all o=
f the vCPUs
are waiting for the KVM MMU spin-lock to create 4K SPTEs when the huge page=
s are
write protected. This phenomenon is also described in this patch set:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11163459/
which aims to handle page faults in parallel more efficiently.

Our idea is to use the migration thread to touch all of the guest memory in=
 the
granularity of 4K before enabling dirty logging. To be more specific, we sp=
lit all the
PDPE_LEVEL SPTEs into DIRECTORY_LEVEL SPTEs as the first step, and then spl=
it all
the DIRECTORY_LEVEL SPTEs into PAGE_TABLE_LEVEL SPTEs as the following step=
.

However, there is a side effect. It takes more time to clear the D-bits of =
the last level
SPTEs when enabling dirty logging, which is held the QEMU BQL and KVM mmu-l=
ock
simultaneously. To solve this issue, the idea of dirty logging gradually in=
 small chunks
is proposed too, here is the link for v1:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11388227/

Under the Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6161 CPU @ 2.20GHz environment, some tests =
has
been done with a 60U256G VM which enables numa balancing using the demo we
written. We start a process which has 60 threads to randomly touch most of =
the
memory in VM, meanwhile count the function execution time in VM when live
migration. The change_prot_numa() is chosen since it will not release the C=
PU
unless its work has finished. Here is the number:

                    Original                 The demo we written
[1]                  > 9s (most of the time)     ~5ms
Hypervisor cost       > 90%                   ~3%

[1]: execution time of the change_prot_numa() function

If the time in [1] bigger than 20s, it will be result in soft-lockup.

I know it is a little hacking to do so, but my question is: is this worth t=
rying to split
EPT huge pages in advance of dirty logging?

Any advice will be appreciated, thanks.

Regards,
Jay Zhou
