If you mean to ask if there is a way to let guest access use no paging at=
 all, that is access host physical addresses directly,
then indeed there is no way, since regular non 'unrestricted guest' mode =
required both protected mode and paging, and 'unrestricted guest' require=
s
EPT.
Academically speaking it is of course possible to create paging tables th=
at are 1:1...
