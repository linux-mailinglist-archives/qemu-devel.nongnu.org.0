No argument.  It's unnecessarily verbose in JSON, too.

The trouble with flattening this one is QMP, where we promise stability.

I'm not sure the connection between maintaining compatibility and
supporting human use is as strong as you seem to imply.

As far as I can tell, the "maybe we don't need any compatibility"
discussion is about the CLI.  I'd rephrase it as "maybe we need a
machine-friendly CLI on par with QMP more than we need compatibility to
the current CLI".

"We don't need any human-friendly interface at all" comes in not because
machine-friendly necessarily precludes human-friendly, but only if we're
unwilling (unable?) to do the extra work for it.

Compare the monitor:

* QMP is primarily for machines.  We promise stability: no incompatible
  changes without clear communicaton of intent and a grace period.  We
  provide machine clients tools to deal with the interface evolution,
  e.g. query-qmp-schema.

* HMP is exclusively for humans.  It may change at any time.

For the CLI, we don't have such a separation, and our offerings for
dealing with interface evolution are wholly inadequate.  We *need* to do
better for machines.

Now, the monitor also informs us about the cost of providing a
completely separate interface for humans.

Elsewhere in this thread, we discussed layering (a replacement for) HMP
on top of QMP cleanly, possibly in a separate process, possibly written
in a high-level language like Python.

HMP predates QMP.  We reworked it so the HMP commands are implemented on
top of the QMP commands, or at least on top of common helpers.  But this
is not quite the same as layering HMP on top of QMP.

If we decide to radically break the CLI so we can start over, we get to
decide whether and how to do a human-friendly CLI, in particular how it
relates to the machine-friendly CLI.
