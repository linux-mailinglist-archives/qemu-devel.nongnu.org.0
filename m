Well I think technically the host is a papr platform which supplies an
environment to the papr guest partition. But the terminology isn't
really important here.

In which case we won't find the device tree property and so we don't
have a reliable way to determine the number of host threads, so we will
omit the property.

No,

There are registers which were previously scaled based on the threads
per core, for example the PURR, but which aren't on POWER9 when running
in lpar per thread mode and instead count per thread. This will look
different to a guest OS, and so for whatever reason the guest might
want to scale these registers based on the host threading mode.
