Seems like the suggestion is that net_failover_pair_id should be an
option on the base class of PCIDevice (DeviceState?) and only if it's a
PCI device would we check the class code.  But there are dependencies
at the hotplug controller, which I think is why this is currently
specific to PCI.

However, it's an interesting point about pci_is_express().  This test
is really just meant to check whether the hotplug controller supports
this feature, which is only implemented in pciehp via this series.
There's a bit of a mismatch though that pcie_is_express() checks
whether the device is express, not whether the bus it sits on is
express.  I think we really want the latter, so maybe this should be:

pci_bus_is_express(pci_get_bus(dev)

For example this feature should work if I plug an e1000 (not e1000e)
into an express slot, but not if I plug an e1000e into a conventional
slot.

Yep, long term it seems very generic, but there's a dependency in the
hotplug controller and it is beneficial that PCI has a class code
feature that allows us to error if this is specified on a non-net
device.  Thanks,
