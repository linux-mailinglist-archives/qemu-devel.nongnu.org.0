By that I mean, as targets are adapted (arm, s390, ...) things can be refactored in a similar was as for x86,
so that the ifdefs disappear, and meson instead controls which pieces are built.

When it comes to the extra field, it was already very useful to have it #ifdef ed,
because it identified quite a few problem with the existing patches, ie, code that was trying to use the field even though it was not there.

So this step helps with finding all the right pieces to refactor away,
and then once things are in their proper place, we can take away the ifdef I think.

Ciao,

Claudio
