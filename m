In a byte-accurate world, no driver should ever report an unaligned=20
size.  If the driver is capable of sub-sector sizes, it is also capable=20
of sub-sector I/O and should state as such in its request_alignment.=20
The block layer then takes care of ensuring that any access of the final=20
unaligned sector or 4k region either leaves the bytes past EOF alone, or=20
at most reads those bytes as zeroes, and maybe permits attempts to write=20
no-op zeroes to those bytes, but gracefully forbids attempts to store=20
data that would cause the file to be resized.

But that's the ideal world, and it requires a lot of code auditing to=20
get there. It probably won't happen in time for the 5.0 release.
