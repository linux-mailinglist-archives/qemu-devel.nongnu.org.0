But we don't really want all of those --disable arguments by default.  It would
be one thing if one explicitly used --enable-gnutls and got link errors.  We
must preserve --static working all by itself.

Well, no, you get link errors.

(As an aside, IMO pkg-config is stupid in being only able to ask "is version X
installed" without also being about to ask "is a static version of X
installed".  pkg-config has a --static option, it just doesn't use it.)

But suppose we add back the patch for --static sanity check from v6.  What are
we left with?  No crypto libraries remain on Fedora 30.  It appears that Ubuntu
Bionic ships a static version of nettle, but nothing else.  Is that useful on
its own?

Well, maybe.  But what are we trying to accomplish?

What use is crypto to the host side of linux-user?  In general, all the crypto
that the application will do is on the guest side, within guest versions of
gnutls etc.  All crypto that the guest expects of its kernel is done passing
off the syscall to the host kernel.

That's why, here in v7, I began to think that perhaps all the faffing about
with pkg-config vs --static was just a waste of time.

Have I missed something?
