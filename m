On second thought, I actually think this version is wrong in the other wa=
y.

There needs to be a bs with bs->backing !=3D NULL and !bs->implicit
somewhere in the chain.  We try to find that node.  It doesn=E2=80=99t ma=
tter
what=E2=80=99s on top of it, though,  If there are implicit node (which w=
e try
to skip here), the user isn=E2=80=99t aware of them.  Consequentially, it=

doesn=E2=80=99t matter whether these implicit nodes use bs->backing or bs=
->file,
we just need to skip them.

What is wrong is the =E2=80=9Cwhile (overlay_bs->backing ...)=E2=80=9D.  =
That needs to
be =E2=80=9Cwhile (bdrv_filtered_bs(overlay_bs) ...)=E2=80=9D.
