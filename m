The trouble is that that approach is inherently s390 specific, and I'm
hoping we can make the configuration at least somewhat common between
platforms.

It also seems a very nasty layering violation to me for changing cpu
properties to affect apparently unrelated devices (like virtio, for
example).  It's still a bit nasty doing it from a machine property,
but it seems more reasonable to me that a machine property could
affect things elsewhere in the.. well.. machine.
