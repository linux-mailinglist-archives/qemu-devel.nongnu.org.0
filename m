Hi Alex, here is a modified proposal to remap vaddr in the face of async requests
from mediated device drivers.

Define a new flag VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_REMAP for use with VFIO_IOMMU_UNMAP_DMA and
VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA.

VFIO_IOMMU_UNMAP_DMA  flags=VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_REMAP
  Discard vaddr on the existing dma region defined by (iova, size), but keep the
  struct vfio_dma.  Subsequent translation requests are blocked.
  The implementation sets a flag in struct vfio_dma.  vfio_pin_pages() and
  vfio_dma_rw() acquire iommu->lock, check the flag, and retry.
  Called before exec.

VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA  flags=VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_REMAP
  Remap the region (iova, size) to vaddr, and resume translation requests.
  Called after exec.

Unfortunately, remap as defined above has an undesirable side effect.  The mdev
driver may use kernel worker threads which serve requests from multiple clients
(eg i915/gvt workload_thread).  A process that fails to call MAP_DMA with REMAP,
or is tardy doing so, will delay other processes who are stuck waiting in
vfio_pin_pages or vfio_dma_rw.  This is unacceptable, and I mention this scheme in
case I am misinterpreting the code (maybe they do not share a single struct vfio_iommu
instance?), or in case you see a way to salvage it.

Here is a more robust implementation.  It only works for dma regions backed by
a file, such as memfd or shm.

VFIO_IOMMU_UNMAP_DMA  flags=VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_REMAP
  Find the file and offset for iova, and save the struct file pointer in
  struct vfio_dma.  In vfio_pin_pages and vfio_dma_rw and their descendants,
  if file* is set, then call pagecache_get_page() to get the pfn, instead of
  get_user_pages.

VFIO_IOMMU_MAP_DMA  flags=VFIO_DMA_MAP_FLAG_REMAP
  Remap the region (iova, size) to vaddr and drop the file reference.

This begs the question of whether we can always use pagecache_get_page, and
eliminate the dependency on vaddr.  The translation performance could be
different, though.

I have not implemented this yet.  Any thoughts before I do?
