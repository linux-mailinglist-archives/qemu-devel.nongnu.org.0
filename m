Thank you for finding this out.

However, this bring to surface another problematic point:

We assume that introduction of SDL 2.0 to Ubuntu is a green light
for deprecating SDL 1.2. In fact, SDL 1.2 is not deprecated by
Ubuntu (at least not by 16.04) - as established by you.

Again, what I find problematic is that we don't take deprecating
of older version of a library by a distribution as our reference point,
but our reference point is introducing of a new version.

Daniel, in any case, thanks a lot for your responses, I will not
respond to another email of yours in this thread, since I would be
just repeating myself - I also responded to Peter and Thomas,
so you can read those responses too for more details.

Many thanks again!
Aleksandar
