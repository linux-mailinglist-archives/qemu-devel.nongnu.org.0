The one that currently is deployed is using the same "list network and hd" =
which should not work.
It will boot network but should not internally fall back to disk.
 10   <os>                                                                 =
          =

 11     <type arch=3D's390x' machine=3D's390-ccw-virtio-bionic'>hvm</type> =
              =

 12     <boot dev=3D'network'/>                                            =
            =

 13     <boot dev=3D'hd'/>                                                 =
            =

 14   </os>

Now lets understand how/what works here...

Qemu is given both boot options (we know it will ignore the second ... or a=
t least we think and are told so).
   ... -boot strict=3Don ... id=3Dvirtio-disk0,bootindex=3D2 ... mac=3D52:5=
4:00:02:a3:f9,devno=3Dfe.0.0001,bootindex=3D1

I'd expect this one to "just" netboot, but we need to understand how it got=
 "up" from there.
Fortunately there was a full log of the serial console on disk.

Title:
  [2.6] Unable to reboot s390x KVM machine after initial deploy

Status in MAAS:
  New
Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in Ubuntu on IBM z Systems:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  MAAS version: 2.6.1 (7832-g17912cdc9-0ubuntu1~18.04.1)
  Arch: S390x

  Appears that MAAS can not find the s390x bootloader to boot from the
  disk, not sure how maas determines this.  However this was working in
  the past. I had originally thought that if the maas machine was
  deployed then it defaulted to boot from disk.

  If I force the VM to book from disk, the VM starts up as expected.

  Reproduce:

  - Deploy Disco on S390x KVM instance
  - Reboot it

  on the KVM console...
