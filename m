Is there any sense in picking the default value based on -cpu selection ?

If user has asked for -cpu host, there's no downside to host-phys-bits=true,
as the user has intentionally traded off live migration portability already.

If the user askes for -cpu $MODEL, then could we set phys-bits=NNN for some
NNN that is the lowest value for CPUs that are capable of running $MODEL ?
Or will that get too complicated with the wide range of SKU variants, in
particular server vs desktop CPUs.

Daniel
