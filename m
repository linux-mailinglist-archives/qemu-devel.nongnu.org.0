fyi, with 5.0 you no longer need -numa!:

-object memory-backend-memfd,id=3Dmem,size=3D2G -M memory-backend=3Dmem

(hopefully, we will get something even simpler one day)

ok! I am quite amazed you went this far with a ldpreload hack. This
demonstrates some limits of gpl projects, if it was necessary.

I think with this work, and the muser experience, you have a pretty
good idea of what the protocol could look like. My approach, as I
remember, was a quite straightforward VFIO over socket translation,
while trying to see if it could share some aspects with vhost-user,
such as memory handling etc.

To contrast with the work done on qemu-mp series, I'd also prefer we
focus our work on a vfio-like protocol, before trying to see how qemu
code and interface could be changed over multiple binaries etc. We
will start with some limitations, similar to the one that apply to
VFIO: migration, introspection, managements etc are mostly left out
for now. (iow, qemu-mp is trying to do too many things simultaneously)

That's the rough ideas/plan I have in mind:
- draft/define a "vfio over unix" protocol
- similar to vhost-user, also define some backend conventions
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/interop/vhost-user.rst#backen=
d-program-conventions
- modify qemu vfio code to allow using a socket backend. Ie something
like "-chardev socket=3Dfoo -device vfio-pci,chardev=3Dfoo"
- implement some test devices (and outside qemu, in whatever
language/framework - the more the merrier!)
- investigate how existing qemu binary could expose some devices over
"vfio-unix", for ex: "qemu -machine none -chardev socket=3Dfoo,server
-device pci-serial,vfio=3Dfoo". This would avoid a lot of proxy and code
churn proposed in qemu-mp.
- think about evolution of QMP, so that commands are dispatched to the
right process. In my book, this is called a bus, and I would go for
DBus (not through qemu) in the long term. But for now, we probably
want to split QMP code to make it more modular (in qemu-mp series,
this isn't stellar either). Later on, perhaps look at bridging QMP
over DBus.
- code refactoring in qemu, to allow smaller binaries, that implement
the minimum for vfio-user devices. (imho, this will be a bit easier
after the meson move, as the build system is simpler)

That should allow some work sharing.

I can't wait for your design draft, and see how I could help.
