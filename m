What about ?

  * Interfaces allow a limited form of multiple inheritance.  Instances are
  * similar to normal types except for the fact that are only defined by
- * their classes and never carry any state.  You can dynamically cast an o=
bject
- * to one of its #Interface types and vice versa.

+ * 'SomethingIf *si' arguments, but not define a 'struct SomethingIf { ...=
 }'.
