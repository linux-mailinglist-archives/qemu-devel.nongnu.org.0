  Hi,

Please use tracepoints.  I'd suggest to use the "log" trace backend
which comes very close to printf-debugging; effectively all trace
points are turned into runtime-switchable printf's.

Mixing (temporary) debug printfs and tracepoints works.

Yes.  There even is a script to keep things in sync and apply some
tweaks like replacing linux kernel types with standard C types
(s/u32/uint32_t/ etc).

See scripts/update-linux-headers.sh

You might consider hooking up your file there, but probably this is
overkill given that the register descriptions are unlikely to see
frequent updates.

I don't think ehci uses larger packets.  I think it simply does more
transfers than physical hardware would be able to do.

uhci is pretty strict here, it counts bytes transfered and simply stops
processing queues when it has transfered enough data for the current
frame.  On the next frame timer tick it resumes work.  There is a
bandwidth=3D property to tweak the transfer limit, you can use that to
make uhci emulation run at the speed you want ;)

ehci and xhci simply don't count bytes and don't have a limit, they go
process queues as long as there is work to do (and they don't have to
wait for host block I/O).

No, there isn't any gadget support yet.

cheers,
