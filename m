That's what you get when you pay premium prices for premium support :D

The real issue when it comes to CPU models on s390x is the variance of=20
features of a specific model across environments (especially different=20
hypervisors).

I mean, all you really want is a way to specify "give me the best=20
haswell you can do with this accelerator", which *could* map to "-cpu=20
haswell,tsx=3Doff,ibrs=3Don,ssbf=3Don" ... but also something else on the H=
W.

I really don't see why we need versioned CPU models for that, all you=20
want to do is apply delta updates to the initial model if possible on=20
the current accelerator. Just like HW does. See below for a simpler=20
approach.

Let me propose something *much* simpler which would work just fine on=20
s390x, and I assume on x86-64 as well.

On s390x we e.g. have the two models:
- "z14-base"
  -> minimum feature set we expect to have in every environment
  -> QEMU version/machine independent, will never change
- "z14"
  -> "default model", can change between QEMU machines
  -> migration-safe

Now, internally we have in addition something that matches:
- "z14-max"
  -> all possible CPU features valid for this model
  -> Includes e.g., nested virt features not in the "z14" model
  -> Can and will change between QEMU versions

Of course we also have:
- "max"
  -> "all features supported by the accelerator in the current host"

What we really want is:
- "z14-best"
  -> "best features for this model supported by the accelerator in the
      current host"

The trick is that *usually* :
=09"z14-best" =3D baseline("z14-max", "max")

Minor exceptions can be easily added (e.g., always disable a certain=20
feature). So, what I would be proposing for s390x (and also x86-64, but=20
I know that they have more legacy handling) is simply implementing and=20
exposing all -best models.


Why is this good in general?

1. No semantic changes of existing models. What was migration safe
    remains migration safe.
2. No CPU versions, less complexity.
3. No changes in the tool stack. Implement it in QEMU and it will be
    supported on every layer. Simply specify/expand "z14-best" and you
    get something that will run and make use of the best (on s390x
    usually all) features available that are valid for this model.

Why is this good for s390x?

1. As discussed, versioning all the different flavors we have is
    not feasible, nor practicable.

2. Features that are typically not around (especially, nested virt
    features) will be enabled similar to the host model when around.


I think I can hack a prototype of that in a couple of hours.
