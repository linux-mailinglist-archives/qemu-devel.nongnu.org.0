Ha. It's definitely "sanitiser" here in the UK (UK English) as opposed to "sanitizer" 
(US English). I don't really mind either way, but I can fix this if it needs a v4 
following Paolo's comments.

Yes that's correct, which is why Fifo8 currently doesn't support wraparound. I 
haven't analysed how other devices have used it but I would imagine there would be an 
ASan hit if it were being misused this way.

That could work, and may even allow support for wraparound in future. I suspect 
things would become clearer after looking at the other Fifo8 users to see if this is 
worth an API change/alternative API.


ATB,
