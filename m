If:
  1. we say we cannot use a Bus as holdable reset entry point (we can
reset it but not (de)assert_reset it without passing by its parent Device)
  2. if there is no additional reset dedicated state (right now a reset
on a bus mostly propagates it to sub-devices)
Then we have no state migration needed for buses and we can probably
find a way to use the parent Device's reset_count.

This is somewhat related to the API TRANSITION part below but I was
wondering if I should add some kind of flag in the interface class to
indicate the support of "migration-during-reset" functionality. It could
be used to at least warn when trying to hold the reset state in such an
class.
This flag will default to false and one would have to set it when
implementing the functionality for a given object class (like I did with
the cadence_uart device).
Maybe a similar flag can be used to allow/forbid using a class as an
holdable reset entry point.

I'll have to handle cold/warm cases but I think it will work.

I'm ok with that. It seems unnecessary at that point given that it was
not used by Device/Bus classes. It will make the series simplier.

I agree, I did not want to commit too much into it before having a more
satisfying API. I'll work on it for the next version.

Thanks a lot for the review,
