This is far away from how our CLI handling works today, since we don't
require left-to-right args. Converting existing binaries to this
approach is going to be hard with a high risk of regressions. This
is especiall true if we try todo an incremental conversion, of
different pieces of the CLI and allow arbitrary mixing of CLI and
QMP throughout.

IMHO a pre-requisite for changing CLI arg processing ordering, is
a fresh binary that leaves QemuOpts behind for its CLI, so any
usage is consistent with QAPI.

Yes, my concern is more about how that gets introduced into the code
for the existing binaries, vs having a clean break where we're 100%
QAPI and no back compat CLI options exist.
