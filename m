Public bug reported:

QEMU emulator version 4.1.94

Documentation states that qemu will create a default nic as long as not
explicitly forbidden (-nic none) or defined ( e.g. -nic <options>).

Observation:
Even though qemu-system-ppc is started with "-readconfig" (which defines a =
nic), another nic gets created. When additionally suppling "-nic none", onl=
y the nic of the config file is created.
As matter of fact, if all items that are defined in config file are supplie=
d as command line arguments, no further nic is created. =


Expectation:
When a nic is defined in config file, the default guest-nic should not get =
created.
That would match behavior when all items, defined in config file are suppli=
ed as command line arguments.


Attached config file.
