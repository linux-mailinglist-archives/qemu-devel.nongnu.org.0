Works for me with "pathname" instead of "path".  I'd also write "schema
file" instead of ".json file", but that's a matter of taste and up to
you.

Aha.

@iterable appears to be a list of docutils.node.literal, whatever that
may be.

The doc string is confusing (I figure you borrowed the it along with the
code).  str.join() works just fine for arrays.  It's not the kind of
iterable that's the problem, it's the kind of thing the iterable yields:
str.join() wants str, we have. docutils.node.literal.

The lazy solution is to delete the confusing doc string.

Here's my attempt at a non-lazy solution:

    """Yield the members of *iterable* interspersed with *separator*."""

_nodes_for_sections() is used like this:

        self._add_doc(WHAT,
                      [self._nodes_for_WHAT(doc, ...),
                       self._nodes_for_features(doc),
                       self._nodes_for_sections(doc, ifcond)])

._add_doc()'s second argument is a list of nodes for sections.

._nodes_for_WHAT() computes the nodes specific to the kind of thing
we're processing: enum, object, alternate, command, event.

._nodes_for_features() computes the nodes for the feature section.

._nodes_for_sections() computes both the nodes for additional sections
and the nodes for the ifcond section.

I'd compute the nodes for the ifcond section in their own function, to
keep .nodes_for_sections() focused on just one purpose.

You could replace

                      [self._nodes_for_WHAT(doc, ...),
                       self._nodes_for_features(doc),
                       self._nodes_for_sections(doc, ifcond)])

by

                      self._nodes_for_WHAT(doc, ...)
                      + self._nodes_for_features(doc)
                      + self._nodes_for_sections(doc, ifcond)

Operator + concatenates sequences.

I'm okay with that.

The visit_ methods take an info argument.  With that:

    raise QAPISemError(info, "the error message")

QAPISchemaGenDocVisitor.freeform() lacks such an argument.  Use
doc.info.

> The current texinfo doc generator doesn't do anything like that.

None of the code generators detects any errors.

I added one to test the advice I gave above.  It doesn't get caught.
Easy enough to fix: move then gen_FOO() into main()'s try ... except.

Oh yes.

If I remember correctly, I disliked "[PATCH 19/29]
qapi/qapi-schema.json: Put headers in their own doc-comment blocks",
because "it sweeps the actual problem under the rug, namely flaws in our
parsing and representation of doc comments."

Our documentation has a tree structure.  Ideally, we'd represent it as a
tree.  I figure such a tree would suit you well: you could translate
more or less 1:1 to Sphinx nodes.

We currently have a two-level list instead: a list of blocks (either
definition or free-form), where each block has a list of sections (see
QAPIDoc's doc string).

My commit dcdc07a97c "qapi: Make section headings start a new doc
comment block" was a minimally invasive patch to get us closer to a
(partially flattened) tree.  Kind of collects the dirt in an (hopefully
obvious) pile next to the rug.

You could finish the job and rework the representation into a tree.
That would be lovely.  I appreciate help with cleaning up existing QAPI
messes very much, but do not feel obliged.

You could work with the two-level list as is, relying on the fact that a
'=' can only occur right at the start of a free-form block.

You could tweak the two-level list just a bit, so that the heading
becomes properly represented, and you don't have to match free-form body
section text to find it.

Does this help you along?

Perfection is not a requirement :)

Errors from TexInfo are arguably worse than that now.  They are rare,
however.  The situation will change when people use reST markup in doc
comments.

Mimicking existing similar extensions makes sense.
