That's a tough one. In theory we can use the cirrus-ci environment to
build for iOS but there's no easy way to get the dependencies. For
UTM, we have this complicated script
https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/blob/master/scripts/build_dependencies.sh
which downloads and builds all the dependencies from source. Adding
something like that to QEMU would tie it to specific versions of those
libraries as well as the download link. Not sure if that's desirable.

I am currently refactoring the code so the bigger changes (mirror JIT)
are separate features that doesn't depend on iOS. Other features work
on Darwin so they can be tested in the macOS builds. But there will be
iOS specific code that I don't think would be easy to CI and that's a
general limitation of open source projects on iOS.
