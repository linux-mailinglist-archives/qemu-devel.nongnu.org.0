My limited understanding on how NVDIMM works in x86 is that x86 NVDIMMs can
work with and without label, but the label has a minimum size of 128kiB.

The current NVDIMM init code always adds NVDIMM_LABEL_SIZE_PROP regardless
of user settings, as you can see in hw/mem/nvdimm.c, nvdimm_init(). I found
this out in my first attempt in this patch when doing


object_property_find(OBJECT(nvdimm), NVDIMM_LABEL_SIZE_PROP,
                      &error_abort) == 0) == NULL


inside spapr_nvdimm.c and finding out that this property is always present. This
means that the way to distinguish between label and label-less NVDIMMs is to
check label_size != 0, as we can see being done in hw/acpi/nvdimm.c. What I did
then was to use this same approach in spapr_nvdimm.c.




Thanks,


DHB
