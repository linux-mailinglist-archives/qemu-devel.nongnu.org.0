Thanks to insist with that point Daniel. I'd rather see every=20
configuration reproducible, so if we loose a hardware sponsor, we can=20
find another one and start another runner.
Also note, if it is not easy to reproduce a runner, it will be very hard=20
to debug a reported build/test error.

A non-reproducible runner can not be used as gating, because if they=20
fail it is not acceptable to lock the project development process.


In some cases custom runners are acceptable. These runners won't be=20
"gating" but can post informative log and status.

[*] Specific hardware that is not easily available.

- Alistair at last KVM forum talked about a RISCV board
   (to test host TCG)
- Aleksandar said at last KVM forum Wavecomp could plug a CI20 MIPS
   (to test host TCG)
- Lemote seems interested to setup some Loongson MIPSr6 board
   (to test interaction with KVM)

[*] To run code requiring accepting License Agreements

[*] To run non Free / Open Source code


Owner of these runners take the responsibility to provide enough=20
time/information about reported bugs, or to debug them themselves.


Now the problem is GitLab runner is not natively available on the=20
architectures listed in this mail, so custom setup is required. A dumb=20
script running ssh to a machine also works (tested) but lot of manual=20
tuning/maintenance expected.
