We have 70 arm machines, 667 devices. IIUC we are roughly testing every
device against everything machine. 46,690 tests.

Most of the time devices are going to behave identically regardless of
which machine type is used. The trouble is some machines are different
enough that they can genuinely trigger different behaviour. It isn't
possible to slim the (machine, device) expansion down programatically
while still exercising the interesting combinations unless we get alot
more advanced.

eg if a have a PCI device, we only need test it in one PCI based machine,
and only need test it on one non-PCI based machine.

I would be interesting to actually get some CPU profiling data for
this test to see if it points out anything interesting about where the
time is being spent. Even if we don't reduce the complexity, reducing
a time factor will potentially greatly help.

Daniel
