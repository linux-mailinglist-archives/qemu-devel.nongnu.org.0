I would say rather than in the physical world reset tends
to happen in parallel -- somebody pulls a reset line high
and everything connected to it simultaneously goes into a
state where it resets its internal state, and stays there.
Things like "don't read PC before memory is initialized" tend
to be handled by "memory is initialized while the CPU is being
held in reset, and then the CPU only reads it when it *leaves*
the reset state". (So the suggested multi-phasing does try
to make our emulation match the real hardware).

There is also some 'tree-like' behaviour in that where a
collection of devices can all be reset at once this is usually
based on the "composition tree", eg if you reset an SoC then
it's resetting all the devices in the SoC. Unfortunately QEMU's
qbus tree does not at all match this "composition tree". Our
QOM object tree gets closer, but I have no idea how you might
get from the qbus-reset world we have today to a world where
reset propagated down the QOM object tree.

In this case we *do* have a clear list of things to fix:
we just need to search for places that are directly calling
qemu_register_reset() (and weed out the handful of "no, really
not a device" false positives). I think that this is actually
the case for most situations where failure-to-qdevify is a
blocker -- it's a blocker because there's a particular API we
want to get rid of or clean up or whatever, and then we just
need to look for uses of the API. If there happen to be non-qdev
devices which (perhaps buggily) don't use the API, we don't
need to care about them because they don't block us from the cleanup.

Probably quite high, given that we don't have very good test
coverage even for 'basic smoke tests', and we certainly don't
have a smoke test that covers every device model. Which doesn't
mean we should be afraid of touching reset ordering entirely:
it just means that for this particular patch I wanted to
play safe, because "remove a TODO comment" doesn't seem like a
solid enough payoff for running the risk.
