Has this been merged yet? There is one patch that I neglected to include
in this series (I didn't realize it until now) that properly sets the
SCCB size in QEMU based on the length provided by the kernel (right now,
these patches allocate a static 4K size for the SCCB struct, which
causes a segfault).

I can post my set with the fix as v5, or I can wait and post the fix as
a bandaid if the patches are already in.
