Thanks for the heads up.

Funnily enough, KVM had the exact opposite bug until c0f0963464c2
("arm64: KVM: Fix AArch32 to AArch64 register mapping"), which was
fixed 5 years ago. We used to actively translate the register numbers
obtained from ESR_EL2, leading to all kind of bizarre bugs if trapping
from non USR/SYS modes.
