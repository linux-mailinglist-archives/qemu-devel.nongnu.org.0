I'll take a stab at doing that and using it for the spapr machine.

I'm seeing the vcpu being KVM_RUN'd too early twice during hotplug.
Both of them are before cpu_reset() and ppc_cpu_reset().

Here's the backtrace for the first of them (redacted for clarity):

#0  in cpu_resume ()
#1  in cpu_common_realizefn ()
#2  in ppc_cpu_realize ()
#3  in device_set_realized ()
#4  in property_set_bool ()
#5  in object_property_set ()
#6  in object_property_set_qobject ()
#7  in object_property_set_bool ()
#8  in qdev_realize ()
#9  in spapr_realize_vcpu ()
#10 in spapr_cpu_core_realize ()
#11 in device_set_realized ()
#12 in property_set_bool ()
#13 in object_property_set ()
#14 in object_property_set_qobject ()
#15 in object_property_set_bool ()
#16 in qdev_realize ()
#17 in qdev_device_add ()
#18 in qmp_device_add ()

Here's the second:

#0  in qemu_cpu_kick_thread ()
#1  in qemu_cpu_kick ()
#2  in queue_work_on_cpu ()
#3  in async_run_on_cpu ()
#4  in tlb_flush_by_mmuidx ()
#5  in tlb_flush ()
#6  in ppc_tlb_invalidate_all ()
#7  in ppc_cpu_reset ()
#8  in device_transitional_reset ()
#9  in resettable_phase_hold ()
#10 in resettable_assert_reset ()
#11 in device_set_realized ()
#12 in property_set_bool ()
#13 in object_property_set ()
#14 in object_property_set_qobject ()
#15 in object_property_set_bool ()
#16 in qdev_realize ()
#17 in spapr_realize_vcpu ()
#18 in spapr_cpu_core_realize ()
#19 in device_set_realized ()
#20 in property_set_bool ()
#21 in object_property_set ()
#22 in object_property_set_qobject ()
#23 in object_property_set_bool ()
#24 in qdev_realize ()
#25 in qdev_device_add ()
#26 in qmp_device_add ()

Looking closely, both of them ultimately stem from the
qdev_realize(DEVICE(cpu), ...) call in spapr_realize_vcpu(). Is there
something wrong with that? I don't know anything about the QEMU device
model to be able to tell.

One other way I found to avoid the spurious KVM_RUN calls is to remove
the cpu_resume() call in cpu_common_realizefn(), which to me seems to
be placed way too early in the CPU hotplug path. Simply removing it
makes CPU hotplug stop working though. :-)  I still have to see if I can
find a better place for it...
