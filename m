As Peter stated, there is no NMI concept on aarch64 hardware. The 
pseudo-NMI in the Linux port is purely a software concept. The OS itself 
decides which interrupts should have the "NMI" properties and sets them 
up accordingly.

For QEMU to inject a pseudo-NMI into the guest would require it not only 
to know that the guest supports that feature. But also how such an 
interrupt has to be set up (currently there is no guaranty that the 
priority used for the NMI and the mask should stay the same across Linux 
version as it is purely internal to GICv3/arm64, no generic kAPI nor 
uAPI have access to it). And also, you would probably need to know what 
is handling the NMI you are injecting.

QEMU shouldn't try to guess "that might be dealt as an NMI, lets raise it".

I'm not familiar with the QMP/HMP nor the inner workings of QEMU, but if 
for some reason QEMU requires to trigger an NMI-like mechanic on 
aarch64, a proper way might be through para-virt. Having some 
"qemu-nmi-driver" in linux which calls "request_nmi()" and does the 
proper handling expected by QEMU.

Cheers,
