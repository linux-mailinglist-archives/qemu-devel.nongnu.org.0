Ah, ok. That's not an issue then.

A few things on this:

Per Daniel's response on the other fork of the thread, I think we can
develop faster if we're not depending on qemu-devel. With the right
set of maintainers on the project, there's arguably more flexibility
in working at a restricted set of code. QEMU can then update the
submodule when a "checkpoint" is ready.

Also, I don't see why SPDK/DPDK would need to build QEMU from source
for their implementations. That is, they will need an up-to-date QEMU
for enabling their development, but they don't provide a QEMU to their
users; they just have to wait for a release.  I talked to Ben Walker
(SPDK), and he confirmed SPDK doesn't really maintain a fork of QEMU.
Apparently there was one when they were doing vhost-user-nvme, but
that's now abandoned.

If they had to add the entire QEMU as a submodule, it could
potentially be an issue, right? That's a lot of code just to get some
headers.

I suppose that challenge is up to the vfio-user/libmuser maintainers
to resolve by tagging rc versions or something along those lines.
Those would be the ones we can add to QEMU master as the work
