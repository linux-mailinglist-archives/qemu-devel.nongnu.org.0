Not that I really care, but I also wonder whether that would be an appropriate 
action to remove this code, as it does not seem to impose anything negative to 
retain it.

How about handling this with an error message at configure stage instead? 
Removing this code does not increase the chance for somebody going to fix 
pre-10.12 support.

Apple currently seems to maintain 4 macOS release branches with security fixes 
(10.15.x, 10.14.x, 10.13.x, 10.12.x):
