I bisected the failure for all but the IEEE6 test to:

commit 602f6e42cfbfe9278be34e9b91d2ceb695837e02
Author: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 28 10:55:16 2019 +0000

    target/arm: Use MVFR1 feature bits to gate A32/T32 FP16 instructions

    Instead of gating the A32/T32 FP16 conversion instructions on
    the ARM_FEATURE_VFP_FP16 flag, switch to our new approach of
    looking at ID register bits. In this case MVFR1 fields FPHP
    and SIMDHP indicate the presence of these insns.

    This change doesn't alter behaviour for any of our CPUs.

Title:
  Regressions on arm-linux-gnueabihf target with some GCC tests

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  Hi,

  After trying qemu master:
  commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
  Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
  Author: Peter Maydell <email address hidden>
  Date: Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

  even with the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1834496,
  I've noticed several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GC=
C testsuite.
  I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed s=
hared libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

  All tests used to pass w/o error, but with a recent qemu, all of them
  make qemu crash.

  This was noticed with GCC master configured with
  --target arm-none-linux-gnueabihf
  --with-cpu cortex-a57
  --with-fpu crypto-neon-fp-armv8

  Thanks
