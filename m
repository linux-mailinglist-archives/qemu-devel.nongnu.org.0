From what i see from the code it is allowed. At the start of the
hw/virtio/vhost.c:vhost_migration_log() routine there is a check:
    if (!dev->started) {
        dev->log_enabled = enable;
        return 0;
    }
So our changes had the same idea. If device isn't started then 0 can be
returned. Please note, that if we want to return error here then the
following assert will be hit (hw/virtio/vhost.c)
    static void vhost_log_global_start(MemoryListener *listener)
    {
        int r;

        r = vhost_migration_log(listener, true);
        if (r < 0) {
            abort();
        }
    }
But as i mentioned we didn't change this logic, we just propogate it on
the whole migration start process during vhost handshake. After it our
tests passed successfully.

In fact i didn't try to use >started field to signal about disconnect.
What i tried to follow is that if device not started (because of
disconnect or any other reason), there is no need to continue
initialization and we can proceed with the next migration step.

Just to be clear here. The assert message i mentioned is described
above. I wanted to explain why we followed the "(!dev->started) return 0"
logic. And in this case we didn't return error and return 0.

But the first error we hit during migration testing was SIGSEGV:
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

I'm not sure that it is correct. VM could be migrated successfully
during device daemon disconnect.

Sorry, but i'm not sure that i've got your point here. We can't stop
disconnect just before vhost_dev_set_features() right now. Or do you
mean that it should be like don't make clean up if device is in the
migration step? Well, it is hard to say. If we can agree that
dev-started logic is correct, then there is no reason for it. But if we
think that this logic is wrong, then yes, we should change smth.

Yes, i agree with you. That is why i mentioned in the commit message
that maybe this code should be reviewed carefully. On the other side
our changes, as i see it:
  - following the same logic with the device state
  - fix the SIGSEGV error in case of disconnect
  - migration/disconnect test passed successfully
Some words about the test:
  - run src VM with vhost-usr-blk daemon used
  - run fio inside it
  - perform reconnect every X seconds (just kill and restart daemon),
    X is random
  - run dst VM
  - perform migration
  - fio should complete in dst VM
And we cycle this test like forever. SIGSEGV during vhost handshake is
hit once per ~30 tries. By adding an artificial delay in the QEMU source
code we were able to hit this SIGSEGV in 100% of times. After this patch
our test passed successfully.

What do you think?
