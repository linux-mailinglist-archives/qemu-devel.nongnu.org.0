Thanks for the explanation. If at the moment the test is simply
being skipped (ie it is not actually failing) then I would
prefer to delay this to 5.0. Otherwise we'll start running
the test and may find that it is actually failing in some
of our CI or test environments. That wouldn't be a problem
a bit earlier in the release cycle, but given we've already
had rc4 and rc5 is going to have the minimum number of
absolutely critical fixes in it I think I'd prefer not to
take that risk.

thanks
