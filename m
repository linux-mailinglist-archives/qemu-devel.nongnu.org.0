After fixing some bugs, RISU can run  some instructions now. Thanks.


IMHO,  the next 2 requests should be satisfied for TCG test.

1. Add a unit test case for any lower level and small function is easy.

    For example, the function in risc-v backend,

    static bool tcg_out_mov(TCGContext *s, TCGType type, TCGReg ret,
    TCGReg arg)
      {
          if (ret == arg) {
              return true;
          }
          switch (type) {
          case TCG_TYPE_I32:
          case TCG_TYPE_I64:
              tcg_out_opc_imm(s, OPC_ADDI, ret, arg, 0);
              break;
          default:
              g_assert_not_reached();
          }
          return true;
      }

    Write a unit test case for it is not easy currently.  I don't know
    how to fill the TCGContext struct and other parameters.
    And there is no test framework where I can reuse.

    The others may say that we can run a lot of benchmark to ensure we
    have a good coverage and don't
    need such a low level test case. Some reasonable. But it will lead
    to a very high test burden and it is very hard to get
    a good coverage only through high level test.


2. Add a unit test case for any high level function is easy, such as 
tcg_gen_code.

    The check-tcg test belongs to the high level testing.

Zhiwei
