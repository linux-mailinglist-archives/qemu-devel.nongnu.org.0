At least the binary size is hardly surprising.

I'm guessing you built in lots of drivers.

It would be educational to try to enable ACPI core but disable all
optional features.

Yes - ACPI generation uses a ton of allocations and data copies.

Need to play with pre-allocation strategies. Maybe something
as simple as:

diff --git a/hw/i386/acpi-build.c b/hw/i386/acpi-build.c
index f3fdfefcd5..24becc069e 100644

     bios_linker_loader_alloc(tables->linker,
