Sure, I am glad to heard this.

point it's x86_64 whole system only, but it should be flexible enough to wo=

setup so it might actually serve for the part II of your proposal. It's not=
 ready yet as it contains many ugly and downstream parts, but I'm replacing=
 the custom modules with Ansible and cleaning things from internal parts as=

allow public upstream testing (again, starting with x86, but more will hope=
fully come).

like the part I, it might catch low-level changes and should lower the vari=

(based on what I saw in my experiment). You have host, host kernel, host sy=
stem, qemu, guest kernel, guest system and than the tested app, which might=
 result in a great jitter. Additionally qemu contains many features that ne=
ed to be utilized, you have various disk formats, block devices, various pa=
ssthrough options, ... as well as host/guest tune settings. It's gonna be h=

My first impression is that your work and this proposal could be
viewed much more as complementary, rather than largely overlapping.

Yes, I am quite aware of the problem of data explosion, and I already
explore different possibilities of dealing with it.

Also, a student realistically can't do aweful lot of difficult work
for 3 or 4 months, so I plan to focus on simplicity, and the community
could further develop something more complex, if needed.

Definitely, and thanks!
