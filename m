hmm, then do we allow vendor specific fields?
or is it a must that a vendor specific field should have corresponding
vendor attribute?

another thing is that the definition of mdev_type in GVT only corresponds
to vGPU computing ability currently,
e.g. i915-GVTg_V5_2, is 1/2 of a gen9 IGD, i915-GVTg_V4_2 is 1/2 of a
gen8 IGD.
It is too coarse-grained to live migration compatibility.

Do you think we need to update GVT's definition of mdev_type?
And is there any guide in mdev_type definition?

ok. we'll use the x.y.z scheme then.
