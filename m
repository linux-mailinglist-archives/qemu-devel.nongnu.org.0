AFAIK those tests did not expose the NetBSD panic that is caused by=20
mainline QEMU (mentioned above).

I have actually run the tests you requested (Herv=C3=A9 described them in a=
n=20
earlier thread). There was no regression. Quite the reverse -- it's no=20
longer possible to remotely crash the NetBSD kernel.

Apparently my testing was also the first time that the jazzsonic driver=20
(from the Linux/mips Magnum port) was tested successfully with QEMU. It=20
doesn't work in mainline QEMU.

Anyway, more testing is always nice, and I'd certainly welcome an=20
'acked-by' or 'tested-by' if Herv=C3=A9 would like to send one.

Please consider backporting this series of bug fixes to QEMU stable=20
branch(es).

Finn
