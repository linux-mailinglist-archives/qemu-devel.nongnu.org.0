Hey Alex!

I agree, in most cases (possibly all of them), a wrong indirect function 
call will end up with something that is catched by ASan or UBSan.
This way, however, you may catch it earlier and it may make debug easier 
(especially with --enable-cfi-debug which is printing an error with the 
calling and, most times, the called function).

UBSan does have a similar feature, -fsanitize=function, but 
unfortunately it works only on C++ code, and therefore is not good in 
the QEMU case.

And, of course, it will also be used to weed out missing functions in 
the CFI filter.
