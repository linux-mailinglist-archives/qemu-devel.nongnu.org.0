There is something more fundamental that seems to be missed by most in this conversation,
ie the distinction between the normal execution path and the error path.

And what do you do with the caller that needs to _know_ whether the module was "there" or not?

This is losing this information along the way, and the callers NEED it.

I really invite, with no offense intended, to read the hunks of my patch and the callers,
there are occasions where we need to _know_ if the module was there or not, and act depending on the context.

The information about "bool is_there" needs to be passed to the caller.

there is a module_load_all.
