nfs_umount itself is a sync call and should only terminate when

the call is done. But there is an independent I/O handler in that

function polling on the fd. (wait_for_nfs_reply in libnfs-sync.c).

This is why I thought the right solution is to stop the Qemu I/O handler

before calling nfs_close and nfs_umount. nfs_close also uses this

sync I/O handler, but for some reason it seems not to make trouble.


The other solution would be to use the async versions of close and umount,

but that would make the code in Qemu more complex.
