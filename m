This would work and be relatively simple.

I'm not sure if rbd_get_size() involves network traffic or other
significant complexity. If so, I'd definitely avoid it.

We need to make sure to run everything that bdrv_co_write_req_finish()
does for resizing an image:

    bs->total_sectors = end_sector;
    bdrv_parent_cb_resize(bs);
    bdrv_dirty_bitmap_truncate(bs, end_sector << BDRV_SECTOR_BITS);

Just duplicating that code wouldn't be good; if something is added, we'd
probably forget updating rbd, too. So I think your solution c would at
least involve refactoring the above code into a separate function that
can be called from rbd.

But solution a might actually be the simplest. In this case, sorry for
giving you bad advice in v1 of the patch.
