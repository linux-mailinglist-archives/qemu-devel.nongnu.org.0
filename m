What are the unique failure scenarios for CFI that these jobs are
likely to expose ? Is it likely that we'll have cases where
CFI succeeds in say, x86_64 target, but fails in aarch64 target ?

If not, then it would be sufficient to just test a single target
to smoke out CFI specific bugs, and assume it covers other
targets implicitly.

Daniel
