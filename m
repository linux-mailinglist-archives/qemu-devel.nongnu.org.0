I've got general idea reading patches in this series.
As I've mentioned before it's hard to generalize MADT since it
mostly contains entries unique for target/board.
Goal here isn't generalizing at any cost, but rather find out
if there is enough common code to justify generalization
and if it allows us to reduce code duplication and simplify.

What I'd like to see is the actual patch that does this,
to see if it has any merit and to compare to the current
approach.
