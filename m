Changes since v4:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20220124171705.10432-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/

Note documentation patch that Alex requested to follow.
I don't want to delay getting this out as Alex mentioned possibly
having time to continue reviewing in latter part of this week.

Issues identified by CI / Alex BennÃ©e
- Stubs added for hw/cxl/cxl-host and hw/acpi/cxl plus related meson
  changes to use them as necessary.
- Drop uid from cxl-test (result of last minute change in v4 that was not
  carried through to the test)
- Fix naming clash with field name ERROR which on some arches is defined
  and results in the string being replaced with 0 in some of the
  register field related defines.  Call it ERR instead.
- Fix type issue around mr->size by using 64 bit acessor functions.
- Add a new patch to exclude pxb-cxl from device-crash-test in similar
  fashion to pxb.

CI tests now passing with exception of checkpatch which has what
I think is a false positive and build-oss-fuzz which keeps timing out.
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/pipelines/460109208
There were a few tweaks to patch descriptions after I pushed that
out (I missed a few RB from Alex).

Other changes (mostly from Alex's review)
- Change component register handling to now report UNIMP and return 0
  for 8 byte registers as we currently don't implement any of them.
  Note that this means we need a kernel fix:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20220201153437.2873-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/
- Drop majority of the macros used in defining mailbox handlers in
  favour of written out code.
- Use REG64 where appropriate. This was introduced whilst this set
  has been underdevelopment so I missed it.
- Clarify some register access options wrt to CXL 2.0 Errata F4.
- Change timestamp to qemu_clock_get_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL)
- Use typed enums to enforce types of function arguements.
- Default to cxl being off in machine_class_init() removing
  need to set it to off in machines where there is no support as yet.
- Add Alex's RB where given.

Looking in particular for:
* Review of the PCI interactions
* x86 and ARM machine interactions (particularly the memory maps)
* Review of the interleaving approach - is the basic idea
  acceptable?
* Review of the command line interface.
* CXL related review welcome but much of that got reviewed
  in earlier versions and hasn't changed substantially.

Big TODOs:

* Interleave boundary issues. I haven't yet solved this but didn't
  want to futher delay the review of the rest of the series.

* Volatile memory devices (easy but it's more code so left for now).
* Switch support. Linux kernel support is under review currently,
  so there is now something to test against.
* Hotplug?  May not need much but it's not tested yet!
* More tests and tighter verification that values written to hardware
  are actually valid - stuff that real hardware would check.
* Testing, testing and more testing.  I have been running a basic
  set of ARM and x86 tests on this, but there is always room for
  more tests and greater automation.
* CFMWS flags as requested by Ben.

Why do we want QEMU emulation of CXL?

As Ben stated in V3, QEMU support has been critical to getting OS
software written given lack of availability of hardware supporting the
latest CXL features (coupled with very high demand for support being
ready in a timely fashion). What has become clear since Ben's v3
is that situation is a continuous one. Whilst we can't talk about
them yet, CXL 3.0 features and OS support have been prototyped on
top of this support and a lot of the ongoing kernel work is being
tested against these patches. The kernel CXL mocking code allows
some forms of testing, but QEMU provides a more versatile and
exensible platform.

Other features on the qemu-list that build on these include PCI-DOE
/CDAT support from the Avery Design team further showing how this
code is useful. Whilst not directly related this is also the test
platform for work on PCI IDE/CMA + related DMTF SPDM as CXL both
utilizes and extends those technologies and is likely to be an early
adopter.

CMA Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210804161839.3492053-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/

DOE Qemu: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1623329999-15662-1-git-send-email-cbrowy@avery-design.com/

As can be seen there is non trivial interaction with other areas of
Qemu, particularly PCI and keeping this set up to date is proving
a burden we'd rather do without :)

Ben mentioned a few other good reasons in v3:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210202005948.241655-1-ben.widawsky@intel.com/

The evolution of this series perhaps leave it in a less than
entirely obvious order and that may get tidied up in future postings.
I'm also open to this being considered in bite sized chunks.  What
we have here is about what you need for it to be useful for testing
currently kernel code.  Note the kernel code is moving fast so
since v4, some features have been introduced we don't yet support in
QEMU (e.g. use of the PCIe serial number extended capability).

All comments welcome.

First CFMWS suitable for up to 2 way interleave, the second for 4 way (2 way
at host level and 2 way at the host bridge).
targets=<range of pxb-cxl uids> , multiple entries if range is disjoint.

With the v5.17-rc1 + patch series listed below.

 cd /sys/bus/cxl/devices/
 region=$(cat decoder0.1/create_region)
 echo $region  > decoder0.1/create_region
 ls -lh
 
 //Note the order of devices and adjust the following to make sure they
 //are in order across the 4 root ports.  Easy to do in a tool, but
 //not easy to paste in a cover letter.

 cd region0.1\:0
 echo 4 > interleave_ways
 echo mem2 > target0
 echo mem3 > target1
 echo mem0 > target2
 echo mem1 > target3
 echo $((1024<<20)) > size
 echo 4096 > interleave_granularity
 echo region0.1:0 > /sys/bus/cxl/drivers/cxl_region/bind

Tested with devmem2 and files with known content.

What follows is a first attempt at explaining how all these components
fit together.  I'll write up some formal documentation shortly.

Memory Address Map for CXL elements.  Note where exactly these regions
appear is Arch and platform dependent.  

  Base somewhere far up in the Host PA map.

LSA backed by additional files for each device (not yet supported)

So currently we have decoders as follows for each interleaved access.
1) CFMW decoder - fixed config so forms part of qemu command line.
2) Host bridge decoders - programmable decoders that the system
   software will program either based on user command or based
   on info from the Label Storage Area (not yet emulated)
3) Type 3 device decoders. Down to here the address used is the
   Host PA.  These decoders convert to the local device PA
   (in simple case - drop some bits in the middle of the address)

Future patches will add decoders in switch upstream ports making
the above diagram have another layer between root ports and
the memory devices.

Note, we've focused for now on Persistent Memory devices as they are seen
as an early and important usecase (and are the most complex one).
But it should be straight forward to add volatile memory
support and indeed that would be backed by RAM.
