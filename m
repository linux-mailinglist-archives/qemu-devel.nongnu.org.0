There is no license issue here. It's only definitions. And if you really=20

The only thing that violates the coding style is "VMX_Type" enum type=20
name instead of "VMXType". And that is right and I will change it in v2.=20
However, the rest doesn't violate coding style.
In addition, I disagree this is confusing. These are official VMX=20
product names defined by VMware. I don't see any value in renaming them.=20
It just results in additional confusion.

Why would the enum constants change tomorrow?
And even if that will happen, it still allows a reader to just search in=20
Google the name of the constant and find results.
Which is better than just making up names that we think our more=20
intuitive than the names VMware decided for their own product.

No I don't. This doesn't matter at all for writing code but matters only=20
to reading it.

Why? Searching for "VMware VM executable" in Google provides completely=20
unrelated results.
In contrast, searching for "VMware VMX" provides concrete related results.
We shouldn't rename terminology given by VMware itself to it's own=20
product. It just adds confusion in my opinion.
> - put in official product names in comments instead of enums
I don't see how it provides extra value. Especially due to the fact that=20
the enum constants have their more common product name next to them in=20
comment.
I provide both reference that can be searched in other VMware projects=20
and web and the more user-friendly well-known name.
> - write code using our coding style
Will do. The only coding style violation I see here is the enum type=20
name. Will change from "VMX_Type" to "VMXType".
The rest seems not violating coding convention. Please tell me if I=20
missed something.

Good idea. Will add a link to open-vm-tools git repo in vmport.c comment=20
in general.

Why is it better to specify a list of all options in a comment than an=20
enum? Isn't enum invented exactly for enumerating all possible values of=20
a field?
Note that even in this simple case, you needed to write "VMware ESX=20
server" twice instead of referring to an enum constant. It doesn't seem=20
more elegant to me.

And again, I disagree with renaming the field to "vm-executable-type"=20
instead of "vmx-type".
