The spec is quite explicit about this:

  2.6.5 The Virtqueue Descriptor Table

  The number of descriptors in the table is defined by the queue size for t=
his virtqueue: this is the maximum possible descriptor chain length.

and:

  2.6.5.3.1 Driver Requirements: Indirect Descriptors

  A driver MUST NOT create a descriptor chain longer than the Queue Size of=
 the device.

If some drivers or devices allow longer descriptor chains today that's
an implementation quirk but a new feature bit is definitely required to
officially allow longer descriptor chains.
