This just means that a single test shouldn't generate more than
128 requests. I guess this is enough for a variety of tests.

This is the case, hence my suggestion to pass count to fs_readdir_split()
instead of the having a vcount[] array.

It would make sense to use this knowledge and come up with
a _good_ default value for 'count'.

I mean that I don't really care to check small values because
they're likely never used by real clients, and we already know
what we might get in the end: the server disconnects.
