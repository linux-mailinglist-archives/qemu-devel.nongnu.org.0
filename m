In my opinion, this is more confusing. Terms should be evaluated based 
on the context you read them.
It seems more confusing that this field is named "vmx-version" on 
open-vm-tools and we name it "vm-exec-version".
So if you don't strongly disagree, I prefer to remain with names similar 
to VMware.

Where do you refer to?

Looking at QEMU code, properties are always named with "bla-bla2-bla3" 
convention.
Also, variables of structs are also named with "bla_bla2" convention.
CamelCase are only used for type definitions.

It's not for debugging. It's for being able to run real VMware VMs as-is 
on top of QEMU/KVM.
I don't see it much different than the existing ability to manipulate 
SMBIOS values from QEMU command-line or add ACPI tables to make a guest 
run properly.
(Which we also manipulated sometimes based on reverse-engineering the 
failed guest and/or examining the original VMware environment).
I can prefix it with "x-" if you wish to signal it's experimental, but I 
don't really think this is the case here.
