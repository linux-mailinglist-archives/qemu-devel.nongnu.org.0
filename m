Looking through old bug tickets... can this issue still be reproduced
with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  Timedrift problems with Win7: hpet missing time drift fixups

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  We've been finding timedrift issues witth Win7 under qemu-kvm on our
  daily testing

  kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_load	FAIL	1	Time drift too l=
arge after rest period: 38.63%
  kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_reboot	FAIL	1	Time drift too=
 large at iteration 1: 17.77 seconds
  kvm.qemu-kvm-git.smp2.Win7.64.timedrift.with_migration	FAIL	1	Time drift =
too large at iteration 2: 3.08 seconds

  Steps to reproduce:

  timedrift.with_load

  1) Log into a guest.
  2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
  3) Run load on the guest and host.
  4) Take a second time reading.
  5) Stop the load and rest for a while.
  6) Take a third time reading.
  7) If the drift immediately after load is higher than a user-
      specified value (in %), fail.
      If the drift after the rest period is higher than a user-specified va=
lue,
      fail.

  timedrift.with_migration

  1) Log into a guest.
  2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
  3) Migrate the guest.
  4) Take a second time reading.
  5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

  timedrift.with_reboot

  1) Log into a guest.
  2) Take a time reading from the guest and host.
  3) Reboot the guest.
  4) Take a second time reading.
  5) If the drift (in seconds) is higher than a user specified value, fail.

  This bug is to register those issues and keep an eye on them.

  Attached, some logs from the autotest tests executed on the guest
