Curious: Is your guest kernel >=3D3.6 with qemu-ppce500 config ie qemu_ppce=
500 defined etc? =

In case u-boot loads/maps uImage format kernel differently have you tried u=
Image vs vmlinux?

And are you able to boot ok with an mpc... machine instead of ppce500 by
specifying a dtb file or dtb compatibility? Do you know if more recent
qemu (2.8 or 3 or 4.2) has same issue for you?

Oh wow I just noticed this is from 2016! It would be nice for such bugs
to have follow-up, closure, or summary of
solution/circumvention/workaround taken by those who posted them :)

Title:
  e500 -bios/-kernel broken with big images

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  This is tested using qemu 2.4.1, but it looks like the code
  qemu/hw/ppc/e500.c has not changed since. This looks like the source
  of the problem:
  http://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dcommitdiff;h=3D3812c71ffaa2cf733c30=
87792b859fef30b7545f

  =

  What works:
  ----------

  Basic invocation qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio
  -bios u-boot.e500 works, I get the uboot prompt and this:

  (qemu) info roms
  addr=3D0000000000f00000 size=3D0x044b8c mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #0: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
  addr=3D0000000000f81000 size=3D0x006b00 mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #1: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"

  =

  Passing u-boot.e500 image as kernel (-bios u-boot.e500 -kernel u-boot.e50=
0) appears to work, $qemu_kernel_addr is filled in, though (as expected) ub=
oot complains about the image format.

  (qemu) info roms
  addr=3D0000000000f00000 size=3D0x044b8c mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #0: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
  addr=3D0000000000f81000 size=3D0x006b00 mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #1: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
  addr=3D0000000002000000 size=3D0x054e8c mem=3Dram name=3D".../qemu/share/=
qemu/u-boot.e500


  What doesn't work:
  -----------------

  However, once I try to load a big image (>=3D32 MiB), uboot doesn't even
  show anything:

  qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio -bios u-boot.e500
  -kernel boot/vmlinux -m 1024

  (qemu) info roms
  addr=3D0000000000f00000 size=3D0x044b8c mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #0: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
  addr=3D0000000000f81000 size=3D0x006b00 mem=3Dram name=3D"phdr #1: .../qe=
mu/share/qemu/u-boot.e500"
  addr=3D0000000002000000 size=3D0x27aeedc mem=3Dram name=3D"boot/vmlinux"

  ...

  The thing is, this used to work +- before the commit, where I'd just
  pass the image as -kernel option, and it booted.

  =

  If I do that now (w/o the -bios option, using the exact same image), the =
kernel gets loaded twice, only at different addresses (the cause is obvious=
 from the commit), causing overlap error:

  qemu-system-ppc -machine ppce500  -monitor stdio  -kernel boot/vmlinux -m=
 1024
  QEMU 2.4.1 monitor - type 'help' for more information
  (qemu) rom: requested regions overlap (rom boot/vmlinux. free=3D0x0000000=
0027492fc, addr=3D0x0000000002000000)
