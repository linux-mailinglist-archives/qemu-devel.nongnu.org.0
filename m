Are you using virtio-blk? I think it only actually enables dataplane
(and moves its node to an iothread) during initialisation of the guest
driver. This makes it quite annoying for testing, I've had the same
problem before.

However, virtio-scsi does what you would expect and puts the node into
the right AioContext directly on creation.

So maybe just switching to virtio-scsi solves you problem?

Sounds like Someone (TM) should have a closer look, yes.
