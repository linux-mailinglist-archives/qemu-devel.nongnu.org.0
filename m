but kernel/KVM usually uses MCEERR_AR(action required) instead of MCEERR_=
AO, because it needs do action immediately. For MCEERR_AO error, the acti=

At least I do not find Linux kernel/KVM deliver MCEERR_AO in the vcpu thr=
eads.

For the MCE errors on other threads, it can only handle MCEERR_AO. If it =
is MCEERR_AR, the QEMU will assert and exit[2].

Case1: Other APP indeed can send MCEERR_AO to QEMU=EF=BC=8C QEMU handle i=
t via the iothread's use of signalfd() through above path.
Case2: But if the MCEERR_AO is delivered by kernel, I see QEMU ignore it =
because SIGBUS is masked in main thread[3], for this case, I do not see Q=
EMU handle it via signalfd() for MCEERR_AO errors from my test.

For Case1=EF=BC=8CI think we should not let guest know it, because it is =
not triggered by guest. only other APP send SIGBUS to tell QEMU do someth=
ings.
For Case2=EF=BC=8Cit does not call call kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu().

Above all, from my test, for MCEERR_AO error which is triggered by guest,=
 it not call kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu().
so I think currently we can just report error. If afterwards  MCEERR_AO e=
rror can call kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu(), we can let the guest know about =
it.

At least I do not find Linux kernel/KVM deliver MCEERR_AO in the vcpu thr=
eads.
In the main thread, signalfd() is not called when it is BUS_MCEERR_AO whi=
ch is triggered by guest.

we can implement MCEERR_AO logic when QEMU can receive MCEERR_AO error wh=
ich is triggered by guest.
