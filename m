Where else do you propose to report command line errors?

This means query-qmp-schema in its current form cannot serve this
purpose.

But let me refine my question.  Could the actual deprecation information
for *schema-defined* entities always be part of the QAPI schema?

"Simple" can become a requirement when the alternative is infeasible or
too costly.

I think you're approaching the "expose deprecation" feature from the
special case of machine types (and possibly CPU types), aiming for a
solution that can be generalized.  That's legitimate.

I'm approaching it from the general QAPI/QMP introspection case.

We've arrived at completely different solutions.  Hardly surprising, as
machine and CPU type introspection are both special cases completely
separate from QAPI/QMP introspection.

Having multiple separate introspection interfaces is undesirable.
However, as long as QAPI/QMP introspection fails to cover QOM, some
separate introspection interfaces for QOM-based stuff are unavoidable.

The separate introspection interfaces we have share basically nothing
with QAPI/QMP introspection.  Also undesirable, but it's what we got.

We've discussed more general QOM introspection, either within a single
introspection interface covering both QAPI/QMP and QOM/QMP, or with a
separate interface designed to share as much as possible.  Desirable,
but we're still in the vague ideas stage there.

Back to the problem at hand: we have two proposals for exposing
deprecation, and I can't see how to reconcile them.

My solution leverages QAPI feature flags we need for other purposes
anyway.  In other words, it's basically free.

As is, your solution involves extending ad hoc query commands that
provide information on whatever is being deprecated.  Adapting this to
general QAPI/QMP introspection involves extending the introspection data
generated from the schema.  This means the additional data must go into
the schema, which takes a QAPI language extension.

I have no capacity for such a QAPI language extension now, and I don't
expect this to change soon enough to matter.

I already committed to QAPI feature flags (for other purposes,
remember).  This involves me merging Kevin's first step (not too bad),
and me implementing the rest (hopefully not bad, either).

Further QAPI needs to be addressed include command line QAPIfication and
general QOM introspection.

I feel all of these are more important than improving machine-readable
deprecation information from a single "deprecated" bit to a full object
type capable of conveying support status, suggested alternative, and
more.  Not least because I can't quite see how the layers above can put
the additional information to productive use.  Logging it doesn't count
for me, because we can do that in QEMU.

This isn't sufficient reason for me to NAK this series.  Your series
"only" takes ad hoc machine introspection further away from general
QAPI/QMP introspection, setting a precedent for other ad hoc
introspection queries.  It could conceivably also influence a more
general QOM introspection interface down the road, but we can hash out
how to expose deprecation there when we have a design to discuss.

It might be sufficient for you to reconsider, but that's up to you.

The one thing I ask for is to adjust documentation to capture some of
our discussion.  Specifically, your SupportStatusInfo's documentation
currently sounds like SupportStatusInfo was the accepted path forward
for exposing feature deprecation.  It isn't.  What about:

##
# @SupportStatusInfo:
#
# This can be used to convey the support status of some feature, such as
# a machine type.
#
