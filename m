Sure, but the consideration about whether there are too many shortcuts,
or just enough of them, is quite subjective. Microvm's code base is
small enough to keep its quirks in check without a becoming a
significant maintenance burden, and doesn't invalidate how other, more
conventional machine types work.

Agreed.

As I said, I'm also in favor of microvm supporting booting from
firmware in the future, as long we keep the simple mode too.

My main concern about supporting SeaBIOS, in addition to boot times, is
having to support ACPI, which due to its complexity and size, is a clear
candidate to be stripped out from a minimalistic QEMU build.

One option would be using the fields MPC_OEM and MPC_PRODUCT_ID from the
MP Table to give a hint to the guest.

AFAIK, qboot can't boot a guest without both ACPI and PCI.
