The user or management tool should know which types of migration a
vhost-user-fs backend supports. That can be passed in as a per-device
parameter.

Then a migration parameter can be used to distinguish between same host and
remote host migration? QEMU already distinguishes between pre-copy and
post-copy migration, so this can be thought of as yet another type of
migration.

=C2=A0 So fundamentally, why do we need this property?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vhost-user-fs is not created by def=
ault that we&#39;d then need opt-in to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the special &quot;migrateable&quot;=
 case.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s why I said it might make=
 some sense as a device property as qemu<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tracks whether device is unplugged =
for us.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But as written, if you are going to=
 teach the orchestrator about<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vhost-user-fs and its special needs=
, just teach it when to migrate and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where not to migrate.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Either we describe the special situ=
ation to qemu and let qemu<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make an intelligent decision whethe=
r to allow migration,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or we trust the orchestrator. And i=
f it&#39;s the latter, then &#39;migrate&#39;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already says orchestrator decided t=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem I&#39;m trying to solve is t=
hat most of vhost-user devices<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now block migration in qemu. And this ma=
kes sense since qemu can&#39;t<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extract and transfer backend daemon stat=
e. But this prevents us from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; updating qemu executable via local migra=
tion. So this flag is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intended more as a safety check that say=
s &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that it is not really necessary =
if we trust the orchestrator<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to request migration only when the migra=
tion can be performed in a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; safe way. But changing the current behav=
ior of vhost-user-fs from<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;always blocks migration&quot; to &=
quot;migrates partial state whenever<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orchestrator requests it&quot; seems a l=
ittle=C2=A0 dangerous and can be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpreted as full support for migra=
tion in all cases.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s not really different from block is i=
t? orchestrator has to arrange<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for backend migration. I think we just assume=

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this is practical for vhost-user-fs so we blo=
