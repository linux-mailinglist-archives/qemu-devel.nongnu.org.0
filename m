The machine cold reset implicitly cold resets the sd-card.

IIRC the sd-bus shouldn't (cold/warm)-reset the sd-card.

Only SDBusClass::set_inserted() can cold-reset the card.

There is only 1 bus, the SDHCI bus lines are muxed with the GPIO ones.

bcm2835-sdhost-bus should not be child of bcm2835-sdhost, the sdbus
might be child of bcm2835-peripherals and shared by both sdhost and gpio
(as a link property?).

I tried to do that 2 years ago. I thought I posted the series and Peter
rejected it but can't find it, maybe we had an IRC chat. I won't have
time until next week to dig for it.
