Title:
  LD_PREFIX option reads directories recursively in an endless loop

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu package in Debian:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  If I run qemu user emulation with -L /path/to/my/sysroot/ in which
  also the proc and dev filesystem is mounted QEMU eats my memory until
  it gets killed by the kernel.

  According to the strace output it follows the symbolic links in the
  proc filesystem running forever in a recursive loop.

  The easiest solution would be to add in the function "add_dir_maybe"
  in the file util/path.c an additional check for symbolic links that it
  don't follow them.

  Also I don't really understand the need of doing this. A lot of
  ressources are wasted everytime QEMU-user is started just by having
  the directory structure in memory. In my case this are more than 20000
  entries which QEMU is loading every time.
