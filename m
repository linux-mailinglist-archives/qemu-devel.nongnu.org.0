This is independent of the ltim patch and I've found this even before 
you've sent that patch as this is in my v5 series which you've replied to. 
I've found this problem before when I've first written this model back in 
2019 and did not understand why it's needed but as now shown also with the 
prep machine there's some other problem somewhere that makes this 
necessary. As the way we had before works for the last few years reverting 
it is the safest bet now but we can try to find out and clean up 
eventually.

I'll try to collect such trace when I'll have time but if you want to 
experiment debian 8.11.0 netinstall cd should boot either with -kernel or 
with the -bios pegasos2.rom (type boot cd install/pegasos at the ok prompt 
in that case but the rom needs to be extracted from an updater as it's not 
freely distributable). I think Thomas Huth also reproduced the same with 
prep or 40p firmware after a similar change on that machine now.

In any case it's unrelated to level sensitive mode which is only needed by 
MorphOS on pegasos2 to fix simultaneous interrupts e.g.with sound and USB 
or PCI cards which all share IRQ9 on that machine. Other guests don't even 
enable that ltim bit so it should not affect anything else.
