Agreed, the Travis integration isn't ideal in this respect. We probably
have to consider to be merely a nice sanity check, rather than fully
gating CI.

The way I've integrated Cirrus CI into GitLab is more useful, because
that uses the GitLab job to directly trigger the Cirrus job, and so
we don't suffer from the asynchronous feedback loop going missing
entirely as with Travis.

It would be nice to integrate Traviss in the same way as Cirrus, but
I'm still not sure it is possible with Travis' REST API.

Daniel
