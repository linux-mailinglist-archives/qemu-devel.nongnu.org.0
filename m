I see.  But then how to read a sector from the block to at least boot
an OS if we use a default-deny policy?  Does it still need a mapping
that is established somehow by someone before hand?

IMHO it's really a matter of whether virtio-iommu wants to have a
device layer besides the domain layer for the initial versions (just
like VT-d has a device context, then it points to a domain, so it has
these two layers).  But I agree for the bypass feature it should work
(though trying to detect "a device is put into an identital domain is
bypassed" is still a bit tricky to me).  And after all virtio-iommu is
always extensible when needs come.
