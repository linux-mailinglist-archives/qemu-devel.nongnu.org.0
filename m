Wouldn't "-e" mostly avoid the inconvenience?

Oh, that's what I was missing.  I thought long term all of it would come 
from pip.  But anyway...

... then neither "system" nor "pip" would not cover the parts of 
"python-qemu" that are always internal, i.e. currently only 
"python-qemu-qmp".  And after

  $python -m venv venv/

you would have

  $python -m pip install -e python/

(That's probably a better way to invoke a pip that's related to $python, 
at least until the venv exists).

By the way, where would you put the python-qemu-qmp submodule?

Yes.

That's usually what we do with missing bits yes; you can use 
--enable-python-qemu to force an error in that case.

Yep.

Yes, it would.  I think that's going to happen less and less since 
configure is on a serious diet; but it might still be annoying.  OTOH 
installing system packages (or also "pip install --user") will speed up 
creating the virtual env, because then pip will not be run in the venv.

Which cases are those?
