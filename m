Right, I am just worried that if I am the only person that shows up in
the get_maintainer.pl output, the submitter will have to know some other
way who a relevant maintainer is that can take the patches otherwise
they won't be CC'd. Or we'll have to hope a relevant maintainer sees
them on the list. Or I'll have to chase down a maintainer myself
assuming the reviews all check out. :-)
