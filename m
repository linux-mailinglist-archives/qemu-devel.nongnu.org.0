We can not redistribute this BIOS.

Daniel, I think there is no problem if Aaron contributes a model of the=20
R300 device to QEMU, right? This doesn't involve redistributing any BIOS.


Aaron: I never received patches 1-4 and 10 of your series, not sure why,=20
maybe they are too big.

I recommend to rebase your series, squashing patch 9 over patch 5.

If you don't know about git-rebase, this blog is quite easy to understand:
