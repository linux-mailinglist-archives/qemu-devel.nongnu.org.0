The TSEG base calculation is not trivial in this environment. The 32-bit
RAM size needs to be read from the CMOS (IO port accesses). Then the
extended TSEG size (if any) needs to be detected from PCI config space
(IO port accesses). Both CMOS and PCI config space requires IO port
writes too (not just reads). Even if there are enough registers for the
calculations, can we rely on these unprotected IO ports?

Also, can we switch to 32-bit mode without a stack? I assume it would be
necessary to switch to 32-bit mode for 32-bit arithmetic.

Getting the initial APIC ID needs some CPUID instructions IIUC, which
clobber EAX through EDX, if I understand correctly. Given the register
pressure, CPUID might have to be one of the first instructions to call.

I agree about that implication, yes. *If* we send an INIT/SIPI/SIPI to
the new CPU, then the new CPU needs a HLT loop, I think.

I think we'll need a separate QEMU tree for this. I'm quite in the dark
-- I can't tell if I'll be able to do something in OVMF without actually
trying it. And for that, we'll need some proposed QEMU code that is
testable, but not upstream yet. (As I might realize that I'm unable to
make it work in OVMF.)

If the default SMBASE area is corrupted due to concurrent access, could
that lead to invalid relocated SMBASE values? Possibly pointing into
normal RAM?
