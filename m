FWIW, I tried to avoid mentioning merge requests, as I didn't want
to derail the discussion & believe use of gitlab for infrastructure
is worthwhile even if you never use merge requests.  I do tend to
think that merge requests would be a reasonable thing to use for
qemu-web in particular.

We don't do any native non-x86 stuff right now.  We do all non-x86
builds using cross-compilers. Obviously that means we don't get any
testing coverage, only build coverage.

We did update our lcitool to be able to build VMs to serve as gitlab
runners, principally to provide us FreeBSD runners. After doing all
the work though, we discovered a way to integrate Cirrus CI into
GitLab CI, using a shim called "cirrus-run".  So now we have macOS
and FreeBSD jobs in GitLab CI, that use a shim to call out to Cirrus
CI todo the actual work:

From this pipeline:

  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/pipelines/164291392

These two jobs actually ran on Cirrus CI:

  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/jobs/628816093
  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/jobs/628816086

We don't get a nice build log output in gitlab but that's just a
limitation of the current cirrus-run impl - we could easily enhance
it to pull the buld log out of Cirrus CI, so it is immediately
visible in GitLab logs.

IOW, the cirrus-run hack shows that even if you can't get a native runner
integration for GitLab CI, you can always use a shim to call out to pretty
much any external system you desire. So that provides a backup plan for
non-x86 CI support.

Even if no one has time todo the work now, if we can spend a bit of time
to categorize current wiki pages and document a desired "plan", then we
can publicise it as a "bite sized task" and potentially motivate future
contributors to do some of the work as a useful way in to the QEMU world.
