Hi,

As Eric reports in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1727347,
qemu-img amend has a bug when it comes to converting qcow2 v2 images to
v3: In v3, every snapshot table entry requires at least 16 bytes of
extra metadata to be present, which isn=E2=80=99t the case for v2 images.
Currently, qemu-img amend doesn=E2=80=99t take care of updating the snaps=
hot
table, so the image is a bit corrupt afterwards (luckily, qemu doesn=E2=80=
=99t
take notice, though).

This yields the following patches:
- Patch 3: Helper patch
- Patch 4: Helper patch, so we can actually do more than just to bump up
  the version number when upgrading a qcow2 image from v2 to v3
- Patch 5: The fix

Eric also points out that qemu-img check does not see any problem with
such images and doesn=E2=80=99t fix them, so:
- Patch 11: Makes qemu-img check report if a snapshot table entry has
  too little extra data, and repair it with -r all
  (Patches 6 and 7 add the necessary infrastructure so we can check and
  repair the snapshot table at all.)

Then I got the glorious idea of =E2=80=9CHey, if I want to see how much e=
xtra
data a snapshot table entry has outside of qcow2_read_snapshots(), I
should add a field that reports that value to QCowSnapshot.  And if I do
that, I might as well make the qcow2 driver interpret the specification
a bit more literally, namely it should ignore all unknown extra data,
that is (as I interpret it), keep it in memory and write it back when
updating the snapshot table.=E2=80=9D

That led to patch 2.  Maybe you find that stupid, in which case we can
totally drop patch 2 (with some changes to other patches).

Anyway.  Because of this, qcow2_read_snapshots() suddenly got more error
case, so I thought now would be a good time to give it an Error **
parameter.  Cue patch 1.

At this point:
(1) I had infrastructure for repairing a snapshot table in
    qemu-img check -r all, and
(2) I had added a new error case if a snapshot table entry has a
    suspiciously large amount of extra data.

I decided that this should be repairable, too.  This is done by patch 8.
(If we drop patch 2, this will go, too.)

Now I was really into it, so I decided even more things needed fixing!
Namely the final two reasons why we would reject a snapshot table:
(1) It has too many snapshots (patch 10),
(2) It is too long overall (patch 9).


Finally, patch 13 adds an overly complicated test (using the new
peek_file* functions added in patch 12).


Max Reitz (13):
  qcow2: Add Error ** to qcow2_read_snapshots()
  qcow2: Keep unknown extra snapshot data
  qcow2: Make qcow2_write_snapshots() public
  qcow2: Put qcow2_upgrade() into an own function
  qcow2: Write v3-compliant snapshot list on upgrade
  qcow2: Separate qcow2_check_read_snapshot_table()
  qcow2: Add qcow2_check_fix_snapshot_table()
  qcow2: Fix broken snapshot table entries
  qcow2: Fix overly long snapshot tables
  qcow2: Repair snapshot table with too many entries
  qcow2: Fix v3 snapshot table entry compliancy
  iotests: Add peek_file* functions
  iotests: Test qcow2's snapshot table handling
