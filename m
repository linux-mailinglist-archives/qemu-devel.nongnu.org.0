Ok.  Kinda weird, but ok.

But.. the thing that bothers me about this is that the guest is
crashing in generic code.  If the generic code can handle a label-less
nvdimm on x86, why is it dying on power.

After a bit of poking, I think the answer is that x86 is explicitly
treating label_size=3D=3D0 as "label not supported" and returning explicit
errors for the get_label_size/read_label/write_label low level
operations, which the generic code is handling.  ppc, I think, is
instead just returning bogus/meaningless values which the generic code
is choking on.

So, I really think we should have the spapr_scm driver on the guest
side check for the zero sized label case and return similar errors,
for robustness.

But, I don't care enough to do it myself.
