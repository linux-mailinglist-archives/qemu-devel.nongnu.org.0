Not maintaining two similar features sounds attractive.

I'm still trying to get my head around the list of issues.  So far they
all look kind of minor to me.  Would you like to summarize them
somewhere?
The appeal of hinting is that it's 0 overhead outside migration,
and pains were taken to avoid keeping pages locked while
hypervisor is busy.

If we are to drop hinting completely we need to show that reporting
can be comparable, and we'll probably want to add a mode for
reporting that behaves somewhat similarly.
