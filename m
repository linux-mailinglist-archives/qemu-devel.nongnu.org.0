Indeed, it also makes me wonder if we should support 
truncate(BDRV_REQ_ZERO_WRITE|BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK), to differentiate 
whether a truncation request is aiming more to be fast (NO_FALLBACK set, 
fail immediately with -ENOTSUP on encryption) or complete (NO_FALLBACK 
clear, go ahead and write guest-visible zeroes, which populates the 
format layer).  In other words, maybe we want a knob that the user can 
set on encrypted volumes on whether to allow zero flags in the qcow2 image.

Indeed, my question is broad enough that it does not hold up _this_ 
series, so much as providing food for thought on what else we may need 
to add for encrypted qcow2 images as a future series, to make it easier 
to adjust the slider between the extremes of performance vs. minimal 
data leaks when using encryption.
