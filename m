Separate chips in the machine (actually not even on the machine mother
board where is the CPU, but on a daughter board card).

So in the composition tree I expect to see them as

  /machine/pca0
  /machine/pca1

The I2C busses is provided by Aspeed peripherals. I counted 19 different
I2C busses on this machine.

"pca0" is connected to i2c bus #11, "pca1" to bus #3.

I still don't think this will be practical, but I'll try your
suggestion.

Phil.
