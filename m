Title:
  golang calls to exec crash user emulation

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  An example program can be found here:

  https://github.com/willnewton/qemucrash

  This code starts a goroutine (thread) and calls exec repeatedly. This
  works ok natively but when run under ARM user emulation it segfaults
  (usually, there are occasionally other failures).
