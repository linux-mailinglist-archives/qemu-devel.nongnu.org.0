Hi Saket and all,

As we are working with automotive platforms, unfortunately we don't plan any 
Qemu reference implementation so far.

Of course we are ready to support the community if any help is needed. Is 
there interest in support for the FWHT format only for testing purpose or you 
want a full-featured implementation on the QEMU side?

Please note that the spec is not finalized yet and a major update is now 
discussed with upstream and the Chrome OS team, which is also interested and 
deeply involved in the process. The update mostly implies some rewording and 
reorganization of data structures, but for sure will require a driver rework.

Best regards,
Dmitry.
