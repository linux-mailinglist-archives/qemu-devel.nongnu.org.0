Thank you for doing this work! Great to see this finally coming along.

What are your plans wrt the per-cpu-lock branch? Given that some of
the races reported here are fixed there, I think it would make sense to
defer those patches to the per-cpu-lock series (i.e. patches 2/19, parts
of 13/19, and 18/19) so that this series goes in first (it is a lot
less likely to break anything).

Also, I would not worry too much about rushing to bring warnings to
0; what's important is that with the warnings we now know where to
focus on, and then we can carefully fix races. In particular I think
all annotations we add must have a comment, since otherwise we are
at the risk of blindlessly silencing warnings of real races.

I've noticed another issue (that I did not notice on my previous
machine), which is that tsan blows up when in qht we lock all
of the bucket's locks. We then get this assert from tsan, since
it has a static limit of 64 mutexes held at any given time:

FATAL: ThreadSanitizer CHECK failed: /build/llvm-toolchain-10-yegZYJ/llvm-toolchain-10-10.0.0/compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_deadlock_detector.h:67 "((n_all_locks_)) < (((sizeof(all_locks_with_contexts_)/sizeof((all_locks_with_contexts_)[0]))))" (0x40, 0x40)

    #7 qht_map_lock_buckets /home/cota/src/qemu/util/qht.c:253:9 (qemu-system-aarch64+0xb1283b)

A workaround for now is to run qemu with TSAN_OPTIONS=detect_deadlocks=0,
although selectively disabling tsan for qht_map_lock/unlock_buckets would
be ideal (not sure if it's possible).

Another warning I'm reliably seen is:
WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: double lock of a mutex (pid=489006)
    #0 pthread_mutex_lock <null> (qemu-system-aarch64+0x457596)

But this one seems safe to ignore.

Thanks,
