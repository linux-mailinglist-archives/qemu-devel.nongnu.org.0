Yes.  I think the only problem with that would be that it=E2=80=99s unintui=
tive
in case the graph is modified while the job is running, but I can=E2=80=99t=
 find
that worse than forbidding that case completely.

(And I think it would be easier to explain if we introduced @bottom-node.)

Hm, did we?  Off the top of my head, I can=E2=80=99t remember any.  Besides=
 the
fact that it would require users to use a different parameter and us to
support two parameters unless we decide to deprecate @base.

I=E2=80=99m not sure whether I agree with skipping filters for the qcow2
metadata, just because then it=E2=80=99s different from the runtime state. =
 But
OTOH I would expect that any application that seriously cares about
filters would override the qcow2 metadata anyway, so I think I do agree
after all.

Yeah, I think skipping filters for the backing file name in the qcow2
header is right.

Who doesn=E2=80=99t...
