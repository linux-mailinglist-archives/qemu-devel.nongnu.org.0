Thanks Eric

Discussed with Jean before, here are some obstacles for vSVA via nested pag=
ing.
Do you think they are still big issues?

Copy "
* PASID support in QEMU, I don't think there is anything yet
// this is not a big issue as your comments.

* Page response support in VFIO and QEMU. With Eric's series we can
inject recoverable faults into the guest, but there is no channel for
the guest to RESUME the stall after fixing it.

* We can't use DVM in nested mode unless the VMID is shared with the
CPU. For that we'll need the host SMMU driver to hook into the KVM VMID
allocator, just like we do for the ASID allocator. I haven't yet
investigated how to do that. It's possible to do vSVA without DVM
though, by sending all TLB invalidations through the SMMU command queue.

Thanks
