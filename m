Hello Philippe,

I have the same questions, and I am trying to understand what is the best way forward.
As a background, ultimately I would like all components of qemu to be highly modular and we are very much on this path I think.

Accelerator-wise, as I mentioned previously I am trying to reach the point where we can say CONFIG_TCG=m,
(and CONFIG_KVM=m, etc...) and be able to install only a simple qemu base,
and have everything else as optional modules, including per-target accelerator modules.

Currently (in master) replay/ is built unconditionally, but I have already a rough patch to make it conditional
on CONFIG_TCG with a lot of stuff added to stub/ .

However, I'd like it even better if it is part of accel/ in the sense that it would be easier then to limit the scope of the overall tcg dynamic module,
which is already quite spread out in the code

(fpu/, tcg/, target/$(TARGET_BASE_ARCH)/, accel/tcg/ , replay/ at least).

Maybe Pavel has some clarification for us on the role and relationships of the replay module with the other components?
Where do we think is the right balance in general in sorting out TCG components?

Thanks,

Claudio
