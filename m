Title:
  [block/vpc] dynamic disk header: off-by-one error for
  "num_bat_entries"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  In current qemu versions (observed in 5.0.0-rc1 as well as
  2833ad487cfff7dc33703e4731b75facde1c561e), disk headers for dynamic
  VPCs are written with an incorrect "block allocation table entries"
  value.

  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3D23850 (the
  corresponding spec) states that:

  "Max Table Entries
  This field holds the maximum entries present in the BAT. This should be e=
qual to the number of blocks in the disk (that is, the disk size divided by=
 the block size)."

  Inside the qemu code, the value is "disk size divided by the block
  size *plus one*".

  Calculating "num_bat_entries" as "total_sectors/(block_size / 512)"
  *should* fix the issue.
