I'd maybe add the links to the virtio-fs and OSv homepage in this paragraph
already, since they are mentioned here for the first time.
For links that you want to use multiple times, you can also declare them at
the end of the file, so that you only have to provide the URL one time. See
e.g. this article as an example:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu-web/-/blob/master/_posts/2017-11-22-ha=
xm-usage-windows.md#L101
In fact I forgot to move the links after I added the introduction. Will fix=
 this in v2, thanks!

Sorry for asking ignorant questions: Does that mean that OSv has a dynamic
linker for Linux ELF binaries?
That's exactly the case: https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/wiki/Dynam=

I'm not a native speaker, but I'd maybe rather say something like:
.. to solve is the burden of the bloat of the modern cload software stack ?
How about "... to solve is the bloated software stack in modern cloud compu=
ting"?

After reading the initial paragraphs of this mail, I was somehow expecting
to see at least a short example / description of how to use virtio-fs with
OSv ... do you maybe at least want to provide a pointer to further
documentation here so that people know where to look next if they want to
try out virtio-fs with OSv?
Unfortunately, documentation is kind of lacking in OSv (the source is the b=
est, if
not only documentation for anything not in the wiki).
I will add brief instructions here for using virtio-fs as the root file sys=
tem in OSv.

&gt; +<br>
&gt; +This article provides an overview of virtio-fs, a novel way for shari=
ng the host<br>
&gt; +file system with guests and OSv, a specialized, light-weight operatin=
g system<br>
&gt; +(unikernel) for the cloud, as well as how these two fit together.<br>
<br>
I'd maybe add the links to the virtio-fs and OSv homepage in this paragraph=
<br>
already, since they are mentioned here for the first time.<br>
For links that you want to use multiple times, you can also declare them at=
<br>
the end of the file, so that you only have to provide the URL one time. See=
<br>
e.g. this article as an example:<br>

&gt; +## virtio-fs<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +[Virtio-fs](https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/) is a new host-guest shared =
filesystem,<br>
&gt; +purpose-built for local file system semantics and performance. To tha=
t end, it<br>
&gt; +takes full advantage of the host's and the guest's colocation on the =
same<br>
&gt; +physical machine, unlike network-based efforts, like virtio-9p.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +As the name suggests, virtio-fs builds on virtio for providing an eff=
icient<br>
&gt; +transport: it is included in the (currently draft, to become v1.2) vi=
rtio<br>
&gt; +[specification](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec) as a new de=
vice. The<br>
&gt; +protocol used by the device is a slightly extended version of<br>
&gt; +[FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse), providing a solid foundat=
ion for<br>
&gt; +all file system operations native on Linux. Implementation-wise, on t=
he QEMU<br>
&gt; +side, it takes the approach of splitting between the guest interface =
(handled<br>
&gt; +by QEMU) and the host file system interface (the device &quot;backend=
&quot;). The latter<br>
&gt; +is handled by virtiofsd (&quot;virtio-fs daemon&quot;), running as a =
separate process,<br>
&gt; +utilizing the<br>
&gt; +[vhost-user](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/interop/vhost-user.html=
) protocol<br>
&gt; +to communicate with QEMU.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +One prominent performance feature of virtio-fs is the DAX (Direct Acc=
ess)<br>
&gt; +window. What is that? It's a shared memory window between the host an=
d the<br>
<br>
I'd rather simply say &quot;This is a shared ...&quot; and scratch the &quo=
t;What is that?&quot;<br>
question.<br>
<br>
&gt; +guest, exposed as device memory (a PCI BAR) to the second. How is it =
used? Upon<br>

&gt; +Virtio-fs is under active development, with its community focussing o=
n a pair of<br>
&gt; +device implementation in QEMU and device driver in Linux. Both compon=

&gt; +## OSv<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +[OSv](https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv) is a<br>
&gt; +[unikernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel) (framework). The=
 two<br>
&gt; +defining characteristics of a unikernel are:<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +- **Application-specialized**: a unikernel is an executable machine i=
mage,<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; consisting of an application and supporting code (drivers, mem=
ory management,<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; runtime etc.) linked together, running in a single address spa=
ce (typically<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; in guest &quot;kernel mode&quot;).<br>
&gt; +- **Library OS**: each unikernel only contains the functionality mand=
ated by its<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; application in terms of non-application code, i.e. no unused d=
rivers, or even<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; whole subsystems (e.g. networking, if the application doesn't =
use the<br>
&gt; +&nbsp; network).<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +OSv in particular strives for binary compatibility with Linux. What t=

&gt; +and as light-weight as possible, based on the assumption that they ar=

 the same<br>

&gt; +<br>
&gt; +## OSv, meet virtio-fs<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +As is apparent e.g. from the container world, it is very common for a=
pplications<br>
&gt; +running in isolated environments (such as containers, or unikernels e=
ven more<br>
&gt; +so) to require host file system access. Whereas containers sharing th=
e host<br>
&gt; +kernel thus have an obvious, controlled path to the host file system,=
 with<br>
&gt; +unikernels this has been more complex: all solutions were somewhat he=
avyweight,<br>
&gt; +requiring a network link or indirection through network protocols. Vi=
rtio-fs<br>
&gt; +then provided a significantly more attractive route: straight-forward=
 mapping of<br>
&gt; +fs operations (via FUSE), reusing the existing virtio transport and d=
ecent<br>
&gt; +performance without high memory overhead.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +The OSv community quickly identified the opportunity and came up with=
 a<br>
&gt; +read-only implementation on its side, when executing under QEMU. This=
 emphasized<br>
&gt; +being lightweight complexity-wise, while catering to many of its appl=
ications'<br>
&gt; +requirements (they are stateless, think e.g. serverless). Notably, it=
 includes<br>
&gt; +support for the DAX window (even before that's merged in upstream QEM=
U),<br>
&gt; +providing [excellent performance](<a href=3D"https://github.com/foxen=
g/diploma">https://github.com/foxeng/diploma</a>), directly<br>
&gt; +rivalling that of its local (non-shared) counterparts such as ZFS and=
 ROFS (an<br>
&gt; +OSv-specific read-only file system).<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +One central point is OSv's support for booting from virtio-fs: this e=
nables<br>
&gt; +deploying a modified version or a whole new application **without reb=
uilding**<br>
&gt; +the image, just by adjusting its root file system contents on the hos=
t. Last,<br>
&gt; +owing to the DAX window practically providing low-overhead access to =
the host's<br>
&gt; +page cache, scalability is also expected to excel, with it being a co=
mmon<br>
&gt; +concern due to the potentially high density of unikernels per host.<b=
r>
<br>
After reading the initial paragraphs of this mail, I was somehow expecting<=
br>
to see at least a short example / description of how to use virtio-fs with<=
br>
OSv ... do you maybe at least want to provide a pointer to further<br>
documentation here so that people know where to look next if they want to<b=
r>
<div>try out virtio-fs with OSv?</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Unfortunately, documentation is kind of lacking in OSv (the source is =
the best, if&nbsp;</div>
<div>not only documentation for anything not in the wiki).</div>
<div>I will add brief instructions here for using virtio-fs as the root fil=
e system in OSv.</div>

&gt; +## Conclusion<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +OSv has gained a prominent new feature, powered by virtio-fs and its =
QEMU<br>
&gt; +implementation. This allows efficient, lightweight and performant acc=
ess to the<br>
&gt; +host's file system, thanks to the native virtio transport, usage of t=
he FUSE<br>

es like<br>
