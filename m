Thanks for checking it, you're right, I'll need to think about this again 
for a bit longer.

I'm not sure I follow the above but I had >= in the check to account for 
this although I've got the check wrong so that doesn't mean much.

What I've used is something like:

base               pitch
+------------------------------------------+
|        ^                                 |
|      y |                                 |
|   x    v      w                          |
|< - - ->+-------------+                   |
|        |             |                   |
|       h|             |                   |
|        |             |                   |
|        +-------------+                   |
|                                          |
+------------------------------------------+

then y * pitch * bypp is the index of the line + x * bypp is index of 
first point which gives:

sb = base + (x + y * pitch) * bypp

then add width * bypp to get past the rect (index of byte after as you say 
above), then moved h lines down that's h * pitch * bypp but maybe that's 
too much because we only want to get to the last line not past that. Then 
using h - 1 is enough.

I think I've already answered that here:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg07650.html

since pixman does left to right that should match the intended operation 
even with overlap when rtl is not set. (Rtl also seems to mean bottom to 
top as well because there's only this one bit for direction.)
