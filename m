I think our deprecation process is not tightly compatible with how 
Python programmers at-large expect packages to work. Semver is more or 
less the norm, despite the fact that it isn't explicitly required.

setting requirements in requirements.txt, setup.[cfg|py], Pipfile, etc 
often hinge on a major version, e.g.

qemu >= 5.0
qemu >= 3.0, < 6.0

would both be common forms of describing a requirement.

Pinning specific versions is considered bad form, but in the context of 
releasing a package, I often see maintainers hedging their bets and 
preventing upgrades across a major version line.

For that reason I am a little weary of adopting the deprecation policy 
as it exists in QEMU directly, and would propose a modification for my 
purposes here:

- Features must be marked as deprecated
- They must remain in a deprecated state for [at least] 2 releases
- Deprecated features may not be removed until a major version change.

In practice, this modification is a change from "2 releases" to "at 
least 2".

However, I didn't intend to pay any mind to the deprecation policy 
"yet", as I have the package metadata listing the package status as 
"Alpha", see below:

Do you think it's fine if I start versioning at, say, "0.5.2", I could 
ignore a deprecation policy for now? I have a lot of changes I want to 
make and expect a lot of breaking changes very quickly.

I just wanted to try -- somehow -- to conjure up a relationship to the 
QEMU package it's designed to work with.

Thanks for your input. This is the trickiest part of the process for me.

I believe there is value in distributing these tools for other 
developers to help them prototype and experiment with new features, but 
realize it's a tightrope walk because we're flying dangerously close to 
providing a management utility that needs to care about cross-version 
compatibility and so on.

I have no interest in providing stringent cross-version compatibility, 
but at the same time, libraries like QMP are not really at risk of 
changing all that much, actually. It will *probably* work for most QEMU 
versions.

I have some further patches where I clean up the scripts in 
./scripts/qmp and move them to ./python/qemu/qmp -- and that work is 
making me consider a rework to this series. I think that rework matches 
the spirit of an earlier suggestion of yours:

- move ./python/qemu/core/qmp.py to ./python/qemu/qmp/qmp.py
- (in a follow-up series) move ./scripts/qmp/* to ./python/qemu/qmp/*
- rename ./python/qemu/core/ to ./python/qemu/machine
     (move accel.py, machine.py and qtest.py to a 'machine' pkg.)


In effect, we'd then have:

qemu.machine -- primarily a test interface for QEMU instances
qemu.qmp -- fairly ageless QMP tools/lib for talking to QEMU

and the different levels of support and "use at your own risk" become 
slightly more clear between the two packages.
