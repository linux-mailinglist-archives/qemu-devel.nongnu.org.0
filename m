Title:
  QEMU S/390x sqxbr (128-bit IEEE 754 square root) crashes qemu-system-
  s390x

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  In porting software to guest Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 VMs for S/390x, I dis=
covered
  that some of my own numerical programs, and also a GNU configure script f=
or at
  least one package with CC=3Dclang, would cause an instant crash of the VM=
, sometimes
  also destroying recently opened files, and producing long strings of NUL =
characters
  in /var/log/syslog in the S/390 guest O/S.

  Further detective work narrowed the cause of the crash down to a single I=
BM S/390
  instruction: sqxbr (128-bit IEEE 754 square root).  Here is a one-line pr=
ogram
  that when compiled and run on a VM hosted on QEMUcc emulator version 4.2.=
0 =

  (Debian 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.1) [hosted on Ubuntu 20.04 on a Dell Precision 792=
0 =

  workstation with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8253 CPU],  and also on QEMU emul=
ator =

  version 5.0.0, reproducibly produces a VM crash under qemu-system-s390x.

  % cat bug-sqrtl-one-line.c
  int main(void) { volatile long double x, r; x =3D 4.0L; __asm__ __volatil=
e__("sqxbr %0, %1" : "=3Df" (r) : "f" (x)); return (0);}

  % cc bug-sqrtl-one-line.c && ./a.out
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  The problem code may be the function float128_sqrt() defined in qemu-5.0.=
0/fpu/softfloat.c
  starting at line 7619.  I have NOT attempted to run the qemu-system-s390x=
 executable
  under a debugger.  However, I observe that S/390 is the only CPU family t=
hat I know of,
  except possibly for a Fujitsu SPARC-64, that has a 128-bit square root in=
 hardware.
  Thus, this instruction bug may not have been seen before.
