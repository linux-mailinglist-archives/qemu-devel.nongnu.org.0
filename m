mbind call in this case should be nop since it's 'reapplying' the same defa=
ult policy
the RAM was allocated with (modulo flags which are not issue in this defaul=
t case).

It looks like there is configuration issue with container (blacklisted mbin=
d) [2]
Is it possible to try run container with '--security-opt seccomp=3Dunconfin=
ed'
to see if it's the issue.

From QEMU side we may skip mbind if hostnodes bitmap is empty to workaround
the issue.
But I'm not sure if it should be done instead of whitelisting mbind in cont=
ainer,
since usecases that are using host-nodes will still be broken due to blackl=
isted mbind.
(looks like mysql has the same [1] problem (but it just warning for them, s=
o it's not so severe issue),
and they were inclined towards fixing container config)

since 5.0 all guest RAM allocation was consolidated around hostmem.
