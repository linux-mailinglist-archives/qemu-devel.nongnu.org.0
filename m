Ok, we had a dedicated mr for interrupt:

memory_region_add_subregion_overlap(MEMORY_REGION(&vtd_dev_as->iommu),
VTD_INTERRUPT_ADDR_FIRST,
&vtd_dev_as->iommu_ir, 1);

So it should be fine. I guess the reason that I'm asking is that I 
thought "IR" means "Interrupt remapping" but in fact it means "Interrupt 
Region"?

But I'm still not clear about the invalidation part for interrupt 
region, maybe you can elaborate a little more on this.

Btw, I think guest can trigger the assert in vtd_do_iommu_translate() if 
we teach vhost to DMA to that region:

     /*
      * We have standalone memory region for interrupt addresses, we
      * should never receive translation requests in this region.
      */
     assert(!vtd_is_interrupt_addr(addr));

Is this better to return false here? (We can work on the fix for vhost 
but it should be not trivial)

Thanks
