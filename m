I think with human-monitor-command, you can have three mappings:

1. The main thread's leader (it is a non-coroutine QMP command) to the
   QMP monitor

2. With a coroutine HMP command, one mapping from the transient HMP
   coroutine to the transient HMP monitor (with a non-coroutine HMP
   command, we'd instead temporarily change the mapping from 1.)

3. The OOB entry

I think the simple approach you had posted could work if you can fill in
the HMP part, but I think it wasn't completely trivial and you told me
not to bother for now, so I didn't. It may still be a viable path
forward if you like it better.
