True.  With that, I'm a bit curious on whether ARM should implement
something like PT mode of Intel's.  For example, have you tried to run
a ARM guest with both a vSMMU and a vfio-pci inside, however keep DMAR
disabled?  IIUC in that case there will be no mapping at all for the
assigned device, then would that work?  Or is there any magic for ARM?
