I prefer to be consistent. QOM's implementation allows this kind
of shortcut where you don't provide everything that a typical
leaf class provides if you don't need all of it, but then it
gets confusing if later on somebody wants to add something
to that leaf class. I think it's less confusing to have
just two standard patterns:
 * leaf class, no subclasses
 * a class that will be subclassed
and then always provide the same set of TYPE_*, cast macros,
structs, etc for whichever of the patterns you're following,
even if it happens that these aren't all needed.
(https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/QOMConventions
does a reasonable job of saying what the standard pattern
is for the subclassed-class case, but is a bit less clear
on the leaf-class case.)

Yes, this is awkward. You pretty much have to inherit from
SysBusDevice assuming you want to get reset (the few cases
we have which directly inherit from Device like CPUs then
end up needing special handling).

I agree that it would be nicer if MachineState inherited from
Device (and if Device got reset properly). But that's a huge
amount of rework. For this series I'm just trying to improve
the setup for the spitz board, and "logic that's more than
just wiring up devices to each other needs to live inside some
device, and can't be in the board itself" is the system we have today.
