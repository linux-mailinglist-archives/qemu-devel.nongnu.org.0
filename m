If we ever add an alternative TLS implementation to gnutls, then the 
abstraction is useful.  But I'm not sure how likely that is, so maybe 
Dan has more insight why he chose this design originally.

I don't, other than the fact that other TLS parameters were also QAPI 
types (such as QCryptoTLSCredsEndpoint).

But that may be moot, as Dan argued that this series adds more 
complexity than it is worth (I originally wrote it while trying to debug 
an nbdkit bug; but in the meantime, I have fixed the nbdkit bug without 
any change to qemu behavior).  So at this point, I will probably not be 
posting a v2 of this series.
