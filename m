Looks like guest assumes this time only moves forward.
So something needs to be done to avoid it moving
backward across migrations.

Neither. Their documentation will be from guest point of view.  Please
look at that code and write documentation from host point of view.
Your documentation for the lag parameter is I think a good
example of how to do it.

Sounds like a good explanation. Maybe we allow -> can
since "we" is hypervisor and it's actually under guest control.

Well close to 100% of users will have no idea what to set it to.

Maybe add " TODO: should this depend on vmare-vmx-type? ".
