Well, yes there is, it saves internal TPM state to an NVChip file:

https://github.com/microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref/blob/main/TPMCmd/Platform/src/NVMem.c

However, if I were running this as a service, I'd condition saving and
restoring state on a connection protocol, which would mean QEMU
wouldn't have to worry about it.  The simplest approach, of course, is
just to keep the service running even when the VM is suspended so the
state is kept internally.

I already told you I tested this and it does work.  I'll actually add
the migration state check to the power on/off path because I need that
for testing S3 anyway.

I could do a blog post, but I really don't think you want this in
official documentation because that creates support expectations.

That's not the only way of doing migration.  This precise problem
exists for VFIO and PCI pass through devices as well: external state is
stored in the card and that state must be matched in some way for the
card to work on resume.  Pretty much any external device coupled to the
VM has this problem.  As I keep saying you're thinking about this in
the wrong way: it's not a system directly slaved to QEMU it's an
independent daemon which must be managed separately.  The design is for
it to function like a passthrough.

Installing a migration blocker would prevent me from exercising the S3
paths, which I want to test.
