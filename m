I'm afraid I have to agree. So the conclusion is that we won't get it
right anyway?

Yes, I think this is the same as I meant by "provide implementations in
block.c".

The job filter nodes have only one child currently, which should be
counted. We'll add other children that shouldn't be counted only later.

But we already have an idea of what possible extensions look like, so we
can probably choose the right function from the start.

Well, you added bdrv_storage_child(). I'd argue this interface is wrong
because it assumes that only one storage child exists. You just didn't
implement it for vmdk so that the problem didn't become apparent. It
would have to return a list rather than a single child. So fixing the
interface and then using it is what I was thinking.

Now that you mention a per-BdrvChild attribute, however, I start to
wonder if the distinction between COW children, filter children, storage
children, metadata children, etc. isn't really what BdrvChildRole was
supposed to represent?

Maybe we want to split off child_storage from child_file, though it's
not strictly necessary for this specific case because we want to treat
both metadata and storage nodes the same. But it could be useful for
other users of bdrv_storage_child(), if there are any.

Yes, that should work.

We should probably still figure out what the relationship between the
child access functions and child roles is, even if we don't need it for
this solution. But it feels like an important part of the design.
