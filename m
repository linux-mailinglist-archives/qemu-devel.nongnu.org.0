Pressing AltGr in graphics mode issues two key modifiers while only one is issued when the guest is in text mode. I'll recheck tomorrow when I have access to a Windows host.

Hi Bernhard,

the keyboard behavior on Windows and Linux is identical. With the QEMU 
window activated and keyboard not grabbed, those key combos like Alt-Tab 
or Alt-F4 are sent to the host. With the QEMU window activated and 
keyboard grabbed they are sent to the guest. I'm not so sure if this 
should be changed only for SDL on Windows.

With best regards,
Volker

I'm running with `-accel whpx -vga none -device virtio-vga-gl -display sdl,gl=on` and I even get decent OpenGL accelleration when the Linux guest is in graphics mode, with wobbly windows etc. Sometimes QEMU aborts when it can't map some OpenGL stuff when the guest enters graphics mode but once that succeeds it runs absolutely stable.
