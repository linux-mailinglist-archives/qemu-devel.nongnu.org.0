I had no plan to send it any time soon. You can base your work on this patch.

OpenPOWER systems use the hiomap protocol for that :

  https://github.com/openbmc/hiomapd/blob/master/Documentation/protocol.md#create_read_window-command

It's based on IPMI but the reads are still done from the LPC bus. We would
need a way to transfer the mem ops between processes.

No. It will be much simpler to run in a single process I think. Memory
operation, gpio lines can cross borders between architectures.

I haven't been following that closely enough but it looked promising.
Having a way to offload mem operations and interrupts should help
modeling in some areas, such as interconnecting external simulators. 
But that might raise some other issues like time control.

These looked good as they were. Were there any objections ? 

Thanks,
