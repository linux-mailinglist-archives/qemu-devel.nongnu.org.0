Sender: "Qemu-devel" <qemu-devel-bounces+lists+qemu-devel=lfdr.de@nongnu.org>

To be precise, as I was doing my own investigation, this only happens
when *both* the following hold:

- a breakpoint instruction is executed in EL2 (as you mentionned).
- ELD is EL1. This does **not** happen **if ELD is EL2**, after setting e.g=
. MDCR_EL2.TDE to 1.

As mentionned above, it's a regression in implementing "AArch64 Self-
hosted Debug, D2.3 Routing debug exceptions".

** Summary changed:

- qemu-system-aarch64: regression: TCG sometimes using wrong values for VBA=
R_EL2 despite it being correctly reported to GDB
+ qemu-system-aarch64: regression in 3.1: breakpoint instructions routed to=
 EL1 from EL2 when ELD is EL1

Title:
  qemu-system-aarch64: regression in 3.1: breakpoint instructions routed
  to EL1 from EL2 when ELD is EL1

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Affects 3.1.0 (latest stable release) and latest commit
  (893dc8300c80e3dc32f31e968cf7aa0904da50c3) but did *not* affect 2.11
  (qemu from bionic ubuntu LTS).

  With the following code and shell commands:

  test.s:

  .text
  mov x0, #0x60000000
  msr vbar_el2, x0
  dsb sy
  isb sy

  $ aarch64-none-elf-as test.s -o test.o
  $ aarch64-none-elf-objcopy -S -O binary test.o test.bin
  $ qemu-system-aarch64 -nographic -machine virt,virtualization=3Don -cpu c=
ortex-a57 -kernel test.bin -s -S

  vbar_el2 is still 0 after the code, instead of being the expected
  0x60000000. (see screenshot).

  This regression doesn't seem to happen for vbar_el1 &
  virtualization=3Doff.
