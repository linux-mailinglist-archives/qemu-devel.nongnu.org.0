Right, and that will always stay the case. OTOH imho microvm is
non-intrusive enough, and small enough, that we'd just put it upstream
after addressing low-level comments.
This will allow more contributions from people interested in boot time.
With no cross-version migration support, or maybe migration
disabled completely, maintainance burden should not be too high.
Not everyone wants to hack on pci/acpi specifically.

I know in the bios we wanted to use memory mapped for pci config
accesses for a very long time now. This makes each vmexit slower but
cuts the number of exits by half. Only affects seabios though.
