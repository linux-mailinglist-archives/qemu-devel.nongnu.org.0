This patchset implements the IE (Invert Endian) bit in SPARCv9 MMU TTE.

It is an attempt of the instructions outlined by Richard Henderson to Mark
Cave-Ayland.

Tested with OpenBSD on sun4u. Solaris 10 is my actual goal, but unfortunate=
ly a
separate keyboard issue remains in the way.

A good explanation by Mark why the IE bit is required.

Thanks all for the feedback.

v2:
- Moved size+sign+endianness attributes from TCGMemOp into MemOp.
  In v1 TCGMemOp was re-purposed entirely into MemOp.
- Replaced MemOp MO_{8|16|32|64} with TCGMemOp MO_{UB|UW|UL|UQ} alias.
  This is to avoid warnings on comparing and coercing different enums.
- Renamed get_memop to get_tcgmemop for clarity.
- MEMOP is now SIZE_MEMOP, which is just ctzl(size).
- Split patch 3/4 so one memory_region_dispatch_{read|write} interface
  is converted per patch.
- Do not reuse TLB_RECHECK, use new TLB_FORCE_SLOW instead.
- Split patch 4/4 so adding the MemTxAddrs parameters and converting
  tlb_set_page() to tlb_set_page_with_attrs() is separate from usage.
- CC'd maintainers.

v3:
- Like v1, the entire TCGMemOp enum is now MemOp.
- MemOp target dependant attributes are conditional upon NEED_CPU_H

v4:
- Added Paolo Bonzini as include/exec/memop.h maintainer

Tony Nguyen (15):
  tcg: TCGMemOp is now accelerator independent MemOp
