Here's what I found out:

Each CPU entry holds info regarding the CPU's address / ID as well as an 
indication of the availability of certain CPU features. With these patches,
we lose a CPU entry for one CPU (essentially what would be the CPU at the
tail-end of the list). This CPU exists, but is essentially in limbo... the
machine cannot access any information regarding it.

So, a VM can run with the original N max CPUs, but in reality we can only
utilize n-1.
