(1) Handy HMP commands while debugging:

- help
- info *
- i/o
- loadvm/savevm
- trace-event/trace-file
- wavcapture/stopcapture
- xp

Eventually also:

- hostfwd_add/hostfwd_remove
- log
- logfile
- print
- sendkey

(2) I suppose these are pre-QMP and wonder about their
    usefulness in the monitor (I'd certainly use a QMP
    equivalent to test).

- migrate_set_capability
- migrate_set_parameter
- migration_mode
- mouse_button
- mouse_move
- mouse_set
- nmi
- pcie_aer_inject_error
- exit_preconfig
- singlestep
- snapshot_blkdev_internal
- snapshot_delete_blkdev_internal

(3) I don't use them, I expect them to belong
    in either (1) or (2).
