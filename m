Hmm I guess I typed "^RPrasad" in my shell to have the last git-publish
command with his email, and I didn't noticed you were also there...

Anyway looking at it again, this patch is wrong because I should check
for addr + blksize < sd_size instead. Can you drop it please?

OK will do.

Title:
  CVE-2020-13253 QEMU: sd: OOB access could crash the guest resulting in
  DoS

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  An out-of-bounds read access issue was found in the SD Memory Card
  emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while performing block write commands
  via sdhci_write(), if a guest user has sent 'address' which is OOB of
  's->wp_groups'. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the
  QEMU process resulting in DoS.
