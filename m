There's no need to change the release schedule IMHO. Subsystem maintainers
should continue to send pull requests as normal. Peter is still processing
PRs, albeit at a lower rate with adhoc CI. From the soft freeze POV what
matters is just that the PRs are posted on the mailing list before the
deadline. If they're posted in time, they're still valid for inclusion in
the release. Our CI allowance is reset at the end of today anyway.

With regards,
Daniel
