Who's everyone?

HW offload requires modifying the user space, too. The offload is not
transparent. Do you know that?

There is a recently spawned effort to create an "XDP daemon" or
otherwise a control application which would among other things link
separate XDP apps to share a NIC attachment point.

Making use of cloud APIs would make a perfect addition to that.

Obviously if one asks a kernel guy to solve a problem one'll get kernel
code as an answer. And writing higher layer code requires companies to
actually organize their teams and have "full stack" strategies.

We've seen this story already with net_failover wart. At least that
time we weren't risking building a proxy to someone's proprietary FW.

It's not hardware unless you JITed machine code for it, it's just
someone else's software.

I'm not arguing with the appeal. I'm arguing the risk/benefit ratio
doesn't justify opening this can of worms.
