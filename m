You'd expect wrong then :-) There's already a real host out there that
implements SVE, but they don't implement any of the optional lengths.

For TCG, yes. But what I recommend userspace to do isn't just to set the
max with sve<max-vl-bits>=on and then all the optional vector lengths,
too, if they want them. I recommend they set *all* vector lengths they
want, e.g. 128,256,384,... even though some of them would be auto-enabled.
If you don't do that, then you don't have a truly migratable command line.
The auto-enabling of required vector lengths makes sense to me, though,
because the code has to detect it anyway, in order to error out when
they're not present. And doing so also gives developers, who may not care
about migration, a more concise command line.

That's true, but what about the bits > 2 * ARM_MAX_VQ - 1? The bitmap is
implemented as an array of longs, so if you don't use a multiple of
sizeof(long)*8 bits, then you're going to have uninitialized parts of
your bitmap. It's safest to use bitmap_clear() for the whole thing at
least once. That said, I'll agree it's a bit subtle and maybe not even
the right way to approach it. It might be better just to audit all the
uses to ensure there's no chance of misinterpretation of unused one
bits > 2 * ARM_MAX_VQ - 1. We could possibly sprinkle more asserts around
to maintain that.

No, you're right, no other value can occur if the 'set' doesn't fail. I
suppose it's 100% safe to remove this assert, but then we'd likely want
to state in a comment that sve_max_vq is now ARM_MAX_VQ, just to make
that clear. Besides catching issues early, asserts are good for
documenting.

I'm not sure "last bit" is descriptive enough. Does it mean last bit
not including the VQ passed in? Or does it include the passed in VQ?
I prefer "next smaller". I'll add a comment above the first assert.

It definitely wasn't "ARM Architecture Reference Manual Supplement The
Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), for ARMv8-A". I'm not being sarcastic!
That manual *should* describe the register, and it *does* list the
register in section 6.1.2 SVE System registers, but there is *no* register
description in the document...

My knowledge of ZCR_ELx comes from reading kernel and qemu code. And
actually seeing it work in practice on real hardware.
