What about having it both ways?

QEMU could always create a PEF object, and if the command line defines
one, it will correspond to it. And if the command line doesn't define one,
then it would also work because the PEF object is already there.

That way, compatibility with AMD SEV is preserved but we also get
command line simplicity where it is not needed.
