Using magic characters in strings to distinguish different types of
objects is always wrong in QAPI. If we interpreted leading '@' this way,
you wouldn't be able to specify a relative filename starting with '@'
any more.

Boolean flags to distinguish different types are better than parsing
strings, but still not optimal. Documentation like "only matters for
abstract sockets" is another hint that we're treating things the same
that aren't the same.

The proper way to distinguish two different types is unions. So I think
the ideal interface would be another SocketAddress variant that could
then also use base64 instead of str to represent arbitrary blobs, like
Markus suggested below.

Probably too late now.
