Yep, these types of bugs don't necessarily bisect cleanly if they're todo w=
ith code layout or dirty memory.
Still, it's good to keep a note of the earliest patches that you find a fai=
lure on - because then we know it must be somewhere before that.

I remember there was a problem reported booting FreeDOS as well; and
I've got to wonder if it's related.

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
