Agreed, unless we warn the user about the model.

I somewhat don't like such options mixed into ordinary feature=20
configuration if we can avoid it. It allows for things like

z13,features=3Dmax,features=3Dbest

The z13 model is migration-safe. So would be "z13,vx=3Doff".=20
"z13,features=3Dbest" would no longer be migration safe.

IOW, reusing an existing model along with that feels wrong, read below.=20
Especially, I dislike that one config option (features=3Dbest) disables=20
and enables features at the same time. Read below.

We already do have feature groups on s390x. So these could behave like=20
"host/accelerator dependent" feature groups. I would prefer that over=20
the suggestion above.

The only downside is that z13,recommended-features=3Don could actually=20
"disable" features that are already in z13 (e.g., "vx" is part of z13,=20
but if it's not available in the host we would have to disable it). I=20
don't like these semantic. Maybe introducing new types of models that=20
don't have any features as default could come into play.

E.g.,

z13-best =3D> z13-raw,recommended-features=3Don
z13-max =3D> z13-raw,recommended-features=3Don,experimental-features=3Don

Maybe we can find a better name for "recommended-features" and=20
"experimental-features" to highlight that these are only "features=20
available via the accelerator in the current host"

We could also expose:

z13-full =3D> z13-raw,all-features=3Don

Which would include all features theoretically valid for a model (but=20
even if not available).

--=20
