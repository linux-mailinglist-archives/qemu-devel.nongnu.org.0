Here's a C program to trigger this behavior. I don't think it matters
what the contents of "file" or its size is.

** Description changed:

  Reading certain files on a 9p mounted FS produces this error message:
  =

  qemu-system-x86_64: VirtFS reply type 117 needs 12 bytes, buffer has 12,
  less than minimum
  =

  After this error message is generated, further accesses to the 9p FS
  hangs whatever tries to access it. The Arch Linux guest system is
  otherwise usable. This happens with QEMU 5.0.0 and guest kernel version
  5.6.11, hosted on an Arch Linux distro. I use the following command to
  launch QEMU:
  =

  exec qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -display gtk -vga virtio -cpu host
  -m 4G -netdev tap,ifname=3Dvmtap0,id=3Dvn0,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno -d=
evice
  virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dvn0 -kernel kernel.img -drive
  file=3Dfile.img,format=3Draw,if=3Dvirtio -virtfs
  local,path=3Dmnt,mount_tag=3Dhost0,security_model=3Dpassthrough,id=3Dhost0
  -append "console=3DttyS0 root=3D/dev/vda rw"
  =

  There's nothing relevant in the guest kernel logs as far as I'm aware of
  with loglevel set to 7.
