I think it depends on the situation. Obviously real code will have
something in the "..." part I snipped.

You have 20 code paths that can result in returning with an error, where
you want to have all variables freed, and only 1 code path for success
Then it makes sense to use g_autofree + g_steal_pointer to eliminate
many goto jumps.

If you have only 1 error path and 1 success path, then a traditional
g_free() call is may well be sufficient.

IOW, as with many coding "rules", there's scope to use personal
judgement as to when it is right to ignore it vs folow it.

Regards,
Daniel
