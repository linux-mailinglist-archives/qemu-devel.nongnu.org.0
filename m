They are not independent. The compatibility interface design depends on 
the migration data design. I ask the uAPI issue in that thread but 
without any response.

No, I think we are talking about different things. What I meant is the 
data carried via uAPI should not opaque userspace. What you said here is 
a good example for this actually. When you expose BAR to userspace, 
there should be driver that knows the semantics of BAR running in the 
userspace, so it's not opaque to userspace.

I meant we can't not assume VFIO is the only uAPI that will be used by Qemu.

We can't even prevent this in kernel, so I don't see how possible we can 
make it for Qemu.

Actually not, it's just question in my mind when looking at VFIO 
migration compatibility patches, since vfio-user is being proposed, it's 
a good time to revisit them.

Thanks
