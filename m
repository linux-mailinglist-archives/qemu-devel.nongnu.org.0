In this case, I think S-o-b is actually correct: I did make some
tweaks to Rich's v2 while preparing my pull request, so Rich is
crediting my addition to his work.  And at the time of my pull request
that included his v2 (before it got dropped for 32-bit build
problems), I had not actually sent my R-b, because I was already
trusting the R-b present from other reviewers.

Oddly enough, even if Rich had dropped my S-o-b line, it will still
eventually reappear, since I'll be queuing this patch through my NBD
tree which requires me to touch it again.  So already having it now
doesn't hurt.

[Many of the patches that go through my tree end up with both my R-b
and S-o-b; but there are patches where I have S-o-b but not R-b,
because I trusted the review of others, and view the act of a careful
review as orthogonal from the responsibility of touching a patch
enough to include it in a pull request]

Good point, and I missed it in v2, in spite of my touching that patch
to avoid silent ignoring when selinux support was not compiled in.

So at this point, I'm less certain whether it is smarter to reject
--selinux-label on non-unix sockets, or whether we try to do the
labeling regardless of socket type; and thus consider it premature for
me to give R-b until we have that resolved.
