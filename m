          ^ validate*d* ?  How does the cert get validated anyway? As a
guest owner what rules can I set about which other host it gets migrated
to?

Actually, thinking about it, I didn't notice anything in the patchset
that checked/gave diagnostics about the guest policy - shouldn't there
be something that nicely says something like:
  'Guest policy has NOSEND set, guest can not be migrated'

?
