In the beginning (v0.4.2), there was -hda and -hdb, and life was simple.

Then there was -hdc, -hdd, -cdrom (v0.5.1), -fda, -fdb (v0.6.0),
-mtdblock, -sd, -pflash (v0.9.1).

All these options do two things: they create a block backend, and they
request the board to create a certain block frontend for it, similar to
other options of this vintage, like -serial, -parallel, and -net.
Boards generally ignore requests they don't understand, but that's just
sloppiness.

For each set of related options, there was a global variable holding the
requests: bs_table[] for -hda, -hdb, -hdc, -hdd, -cdrom; fd_table[]
-fda, -fdb; mtd_bdrv for -mtd; sd_drv for -ds; pflash_table[] for
-pflash.

The options replaced prior ones, except for -pflash, which appended to
its table.

bs_table[]'s index had a peculiar meaning: it's bus * MAX_IDE_DEVS +
unit.  This ensures that -hda (index 0) goes on IDE bus 0 as unit 0;
-hdb on bus 0, unit 1; -hdc on 1, 0; -hdc on 1, 1.

Life was now complicated enough for a generalization (v0.9.1), so there
was -drive (v0.9.1).  All the variables holding requests were fused into
drives_table[].  Table elements are identified by (type, bus, unit),
where type is an enum whose members correspond to the old global
variables: IF_IDE for bs_table[], IF_FLOPPY for fd_table[], and so
forth.  So:

    -hda becomes type =3D IF_IDE, bus =3D 0, unit =3D 0
    -hdb becomes type =3D IF_IDE, bus =3D 0, unit =3D 1
    ...
    -sd becomes type =3D IF_SD, bus =3D 0, unit =3D 0
    1st -pflash becomes type =3D IF_PFLASH, bus =3D 0, unit =3D 0
    2nd -pflash becomes type =3D IF_PFLASH, bus =3D 0, unit =3D 1
    ...

Other mappings from old to new global variables would have been
possible.  I figure this one was chosen because it comes with a
reasonable user interface.  Identifying block devices by (interface
type, bus, unit) is certainly nicer than by index in bs_table[].  Since
bus and/or unit make sense only with some interface types, they are
optional.

Things calmed down for a couple of years, until -device appeared
(v0.12).  Now we needed a way to define just a backend, without
requesting a frontend from the board.  Instead of inventing a new
option, this became IF_NONE, with meaningless bus and unit.

Over the next years, the block layer outgrew -drive's limited
capabilities to define frontends.  -blockdev appeard (v1.7.0) and
matured over several releases.  I don't remember exactly when it became
stable, relegating -drive if=3Dnone to legacy status.

What's *not* legacy is -drive with other interface types, simply because
there is no replacement.  Yet.  We clearly want one.

Questions?
