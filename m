In theory any x86 CPU that meets the ABI level, regardless of vendor
but if any vendor's set of CPUID features diverges too far from other
CPUs of similar level we might have problems.

For example, I had to specially avoid including "aes" in the
x86-64-abi3 because of the Hugon chips lacking it. There might
be other cases like this, since I've only compared CPUID sets
for named CPUs that QEMU includes.

Choice of CPU models is a critical decision in your future ability
to live migrate, so I wanted to call that out specifically.
