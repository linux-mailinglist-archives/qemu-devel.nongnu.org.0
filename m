On s390x, we also glue some magic numbers to the models (e.g., CPU ID,
IBC value, HW generation). IOW, you can't
make a z12 to a z13 just by adding features. The guest is able to
observe these magic numbers. That's also one reason we need distinct
base models.

What would happen right now if you would do a static expansion of e.g.,
"SandyBridge" or of "host"? wouldn't all these knobs also have to be
expanded as well?

I guess we would have to include - but a long list of features wouldn't
really be problematic, right? (at least when tooling just expands and
passes on whatever it gets). Same as when expanding "host".

I don't see a real alternative to get "the best model of a specific
generation for the current accel+hw+firmware". Ack that we should
clarify all implications (and requirements) first, before taking that path.

At least the concept of feature groups should be easy to explain.

>=20

I guess "all-features=3Don"  would only be useful for some sort of
introspection (or testing), but not actually for something else I guess.

One interesting use case of "all-features=3Doff/recommended-features=3Don"
could be

-cpu host,all-features=3Doff,recommended-features=3Don

Would allow us to disable all deprecated features when starting a new VM
that we have to keep in the "host" model to keep baseline/runnability
tests working and migration of old VMs unchanged.
