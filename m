Yes.  But when you consider that sizeof(features) is a compile-time=20
constant, it isn't really dynamic for a given qemu release, but rather a=20
different way to spell things; about the only thing it would buy us is=20
that our cutoff window for what cluster size no longer gets the header=20
may automatically shift from 2k to 4k to 8k as future qemu versions add=20
more qcow2 features.  If we want to write it like that, which size limit=20
do you propose?  Or asked differently, how much space should we reserve=20
for other extension headers + backing file name?
