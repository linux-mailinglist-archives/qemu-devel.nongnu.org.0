Ok, that's graceful, but horrifically useless as an error message :-)

I'd like to think there would be a way to do better.

It looks like the 'drive-add' (or whatever we run to add the
backend) is failing, and then we blindly run device_add anyway.

This means either there's some error message printed that we
are missing, or QEMU is not reporting it back to the monitor.
Either way, I think this can be improved so that libvirt can
directly report the message you found hidden in the log:
