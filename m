Generic solution is of course better.

Hmm. I'm on Ubuntu 22.04.

readelf -n /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64

Displaying notes found in: .note.gnu.property
   Owner                Data size        Description
   GNU                  0x00000020       NT_GNU_PROPERTY_TYPE_0
       Properties: x86 feature: IBT, SHSTK
         x86 ISA needed: x86-64-baseline

OK. But I can't find this build-id in core file..

readelf -n /tmp/cores/core.qemu-system-x86.20351.vsementsov-win.1676544081 | grep -i 'build'  ----  gets nothing

strings /tmp/cores//core.qemu-system-x86.20351.vsementsov-win.1676544081 | grep 4298cd7c2623c58e   ---- nothing as well

So the case is to find the package not having the binary, only by core file.

Probably right solution is to fix our workflow so that if you have core file you always have corresponding binary as well.

Still, having the information exactly inside core file seems good anyway. Maybe there is a generic way to force the system put "Packaging Metadata" into core file on creation of it?
