4.2.0-rc0 has been tagged, i.e. we're in hard freeze already.  Only bug
fixes are accepted during hard freeze.  We've occasionally bent this
rule after -rc0 for borderline cases, e.g. to tweak a new external
interface before the release calcifies it.  Making a case for bending
the rules becomes harder with each -rc.

Ideally, we'd double-check new interfaces for gaffes before a release,
and whether old interfaces that have been replaced now should be
deprecated.  There's rarely time for that, and pretty much never for
releases right after KVM Forum.

So no, I don't have anything in mind for 4.2.

We intend to tag -rc1 next Tuesday.  To make that deadline, we'd need
patches, not just ideas.

See above.

Sounds workable to me, but I'm not the maintainer.

hard freeze.

Unnecessarily risky compared to 1.1.

Not nice.

We do it for QMP, but only because we still lack the means to warn
there.

To have a chance there, we need patches a.s.a.p.
