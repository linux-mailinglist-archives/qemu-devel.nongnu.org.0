Right.  I'm trying to get a better understand of how exactly QOM
is used internally when it's not user-visible.  Not being able to
distinguish internal and external usage when looking at the code
makes it very difficult to clean up external QOM-based
interfaces.

Thanks for the explanation.

Now, how do I locate the code that depends on those QOM
properties to work?  When the property name is visible in the
code, I can grep for the property name.  But I don't know how to
find users of the GPIOs exposed by qdev_pass_gpios().
