The centos7 dockerfile will need to add the extra repo to pull
this in. I don't see any issue with that getting fixed in this
cycle.

As for any CI maintained by third parties outside QEMU tree,
they'll just have to adapt themselves. It is not difficult to
add repos, so again I don't see a big reason to delay. If we
delay chances are they won't bother to update their CI at all
until we make the py3 change in 4.2 anyway.

I don't think there was any hard objection, someone just needs to write
the patch...
