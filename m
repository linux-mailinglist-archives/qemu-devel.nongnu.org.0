How is the "--" line represented in the code?

Please make use of the full line length for the commit text, and add
empty lines between paragraphs.

This fits in a single line.

This is range_covers_byte(dbs->sg->sg[i].base, dbs->sg->sg[i].len, cur_addr=
).

cur_len is now the number of bytes have are not covered by sg[i] yet.
cur_addr is unchanged. It's not used after this, so I guess this
inconsistency is acceptable.

This is range_covers_byte(cur_addr, cur_len, dbs->sg->sg[i].base).

> +                    cur_len =3D dbs->sg->sg[i].base - cur_addr;

cur_len is again the number of bytes not covered by sg[i]. cur_addr is
unchanged, but actually makes sense in this branch.

What stops a guest from adding a zero-length entry?

The if statement requires braces.

You're adding a possibly shortened iovec entry here, and then you
continue to add more iovec entries after it. This is the part where I
think the "--" entries from the commit message are missing.

dbs->io_func doesn't know that some part in the middle of the request is
missing, so you'll operate on the wrong data.

Ok, if we already had something before the "hole", this just splits the
request in two.

How is it possible for dbs->iov.size to be 0, when we just found out
that it overlaps with something?

Ok, if we didn't have anything before it (for whatever reason), we can
just start the request later.

I think the concept of skipping SG list entries makes this patch
relatively complex. Maybe one of these would work better:

1. Instead of skipping, add a temporary bounce buffer to the iovec.

2. Instead of skipping, just exit the loop and effectively split the
   request in multiple parts (like you already do in one case). Then the
   memory will still be written to twice, but deterministically so that
   the later SG list entry always wins.

I think 2. sounds quite attractive because you don't have to manage any
additional state. You can even simplify the loop to use ranges_overlap()
instead of two separate cases: No matter which way the ranges overlap,
you just execute the first part and continue with the overlapping part
in the next dma_blk_cb() callback.
