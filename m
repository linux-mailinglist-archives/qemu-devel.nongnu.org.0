The CAS reboot flag was introduced in QEMU 2.10 to allow the guest
to be presented a new boot-time device tree after CAS negotiation.
CAS-generated resets rely on qemu_system_reset_request() which has
the particularity of dropping the main loop lock at some point. This
opens a window where migration can happen, hence promotting the CAS
reboot flag to actual state that we should also migrate. In practice,
this can't happen anymore since we have eliminated the scenario of
the XICS/XIVE switch and the much less frequent scenario of device
plug/unplug before CAS.

We still have much of the CAS reboot bits around though. The full FDT
rendering we do at CAS is enough to get rid of them once and far all.

Some preliminary cleanup is made before going for the full removal,
for easier reviewing. At some point I had the need to move some code
around in CAS, and Alexey's patch from the "spapr: kill SLOF" (v8)
series proved to be helpful so I've reused it in this patchset.

This series applies cleanly on both ppc-for-5.0 and ppc-for-5.1.
Since it doesn't fix any actual bug, I think this can be delayed
to 5.1.
