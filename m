The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter of the bug
in the new system and thus won't get notified on changes anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Qemu DOS Quake - 640x480 and above resolutions - Unable to load VESA
  palette in dos prompt and game crashing are not working

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I have problem make Quake Demo working with 640x480+, with 320x200 workin=
g fine.
  I tried 3 virtual videocards settings: -vga cirrus 640x480 is not availab=
le, probably emulated GPU has not enough VRAM or some Vesa2 utility is need=
ed. For -vga std and -vga vmware // 640x480 is available in game menu, but =
when i tried to set it, im getting: Unable to load VESA palette in dos prom=
pt and game crashing.
  With vmware svgaII other Q2DOS 640x480 and 1024x768 its working fine, so =
it not working only with some games.

    Qemu 4.2, its same on Linux and Windows.
