At least for the linux guest implementation, I wouldn't think the
uuids would be exposed from the kernel. To me, it seems like something
that should be handled internally by the virtio drivers. Especially
since the 'export' process would be very much a virtio-specific
action, so it's likely that it wouldn't fit nicely into existing
userspace software. If you use some other guest with untrusted
userspace drivers, or if you're pulling the uuids out of the kernel to
give to some non-virtio transport, then I can see it being a concern.

Ah, okay. I misunderstood the original statement. I read the sentence
as 'we can use virtio-gpu in place of the dedicated buffer sharing
device', rather than 'every device can manage its own buffers'. I can
agree with the second meaning.

With the uuid approach, how should this case be handled? Should it be
equivalent to exporting and importing the buffer which was created
first? Should the spec say it's undefined behavior that might work as
expected but might not, depending on the device implementation? Does
the spec even need to say anything about it?

Not just buffers not backed by guest ram, but things like fences. I
would suggest the uuids represent 'exported resources' rather than
'exported buffers'.

I guess this depends on what you're passing around within the guest.
If you're passing around the raw uuids, sure. But I would argue it's
better to pass around unforgeable identifiers (e.g. fds), and to
restrict the uuids to when talking directly to the virtio transport.
But I guess there are likely situations where that's not possible.
