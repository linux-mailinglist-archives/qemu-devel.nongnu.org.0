Welllllllllllllll. At the moment it's library only. but one of the
things you can do with a library is define executable entry-points into
that library.

If you haven't cast an eye at that 32 patch series yet, it basically
creates a structure like this:

> ./python/qemu/lib/[qmp|machine|qtest|accel].py

qemu/ forms a PEP420 namespace; the idea is to be able to modularly
create and independently package subpackages.

qemu/lib forms a proper python package in which there are no
executables, just a library, as you say.

My idea is that anything under python/*/ ought to form a properly
formatted package. So we could, for instance, have a
python/qemu/devtools namespace which packages and collects a bunch of
our little scripts.

Then we could make sure we hit them with the same
mypy/pylint/flake8/whatever as the core libraries those scripts are
using to keep them in sync better.

And, ideally, if they are all using the same kind of paradigms for
import and dependency management it will be easier to use them and keep
them up to date, etc.

For using them as a developer, you could, say,
cd  ~/src/qemu/python
pip3 install --user -e .

and install the source packages to your local environment and then have
access to e.g.

> qmp-shell

right on your CLI, without having to fuss with PYTHONPATH or anything
else. As you update the source repo, you'll get the new versions of the
package living in your python environment automatically.

Of course, this maybe has downsides too; so you can always use a virtual
environment to adopt a context in which you have these tools. For that,

> pip3 install --user pipenv  # or use dnf, or apt, w/e.
> cd ~/src/qemu/python
> pipenv shell
> pip install -e .

And from here you'll have the dev package installed to a development
venv that you can use.

*cough* anyway, that's wildly off-topic.

Generally, you want to format a library such that you have a callable
entry point, maybe named main(). So you'd have some qmp-shell module and
it has a main() function.

Then, in the setup.py script, you'd define qemu.lib.qmp_shell:main() as
an entry point and give it a name like 'qmp-shell'. When pip/setuptools
processes your package installation, it'll create a shim for you in e.g.
~/.local/bin/qmp-shell that will just load the library and execute that
entrypoint for you.

I was thinking I'd do this for all of our python scripts so I could
spend my energy on a pylint/mypy test infrastructure *once* and *in one
place* and then it would be easier to detect regressions for scripts
that don't actually run as part of the test suite.

It would also do well with a fully schema-validated API if we actually
knew exactly what a "QMP Message" was and had some guarantee about
exactly what fields and types it had.

This is where a generated validator would really help for type-safe SDK
tooling.

... We of course do not have that right now, and might not ever, so
yeah, 'Any' type is fine -- but I really want to rewrite this function
because it does stick out as ugly and hard to read, I admit :(

Anything that's hard to type -- by the person who wrote most of it -- is
going to be hard to use or understand. Time for a rework.

Alright, I'll try to hit it halfway -- I spent some time thinking about
a "full" job running framework but ran into some dead-ends I wasn't too
happy with, and wasn't convinced this was a simplification of any kind.

Still, seeing part of the job running code get duplicated in 040 was a
motivation to try and provide some universal job-running monster that
would be extensible for nearly any task.

Unfortunately that complexity does generally make the calling sites look
worse, so I cooled off on the idea since.

So I did intend this as an RFC, because I'm not really 100% happy with
the design.

I assume you mean "Let's just put it in iotests.py for now."

If we do decide to take that 32 patch series to formalize a qemu lib, it
will not be hard to start moving things from here to there.

I will probably take an eye to our iotests and see what functionality
gets duplicated or used a lot and try to push more things down into the
stack where possible.

The QMP event handling stuff in particular seems needlessly split
between qmp.py, machine.py, iotests.py, etc.
