So, that's not something I'd considered particularly in this context,
but it has bothered me in other contexts.  The fact that all the QOM
interfaces are freely user-inspectable, but are also used for a bunch
of interaction between qemu components means that we (arguably)
routinely make a bunch of stuff into user-visible API which we
probably don't really need or want to.
