Jobs that require a custom runner should not be set to run by default,
but individual contributors must absolutely be able to opt-in to running
those jobs simply by registering a runner on their account.

I don't really know what yiu mean here, but "Inherantly different"
does not sound like a desirable property.

The key goal of CI is to reduce the burden on maintainers. The biggest
cost is if we merge code and failure is noticed after merge. IT is
still a large cost, however, if Peter only finds a CI failure when he
attempts the pre-merge test. He has to throw out the pull request
putting more work on the subsystem maintainer. The subsystem maintainer
may have to throw it back to the original author.

The ideal scenario that we need to strive towards is that the original
author has tested their code with 100% coverage of all the CI jobs QMEU
has defined.

Any time there is a job that is not run by authors, but only by the
maintainers, we are putting increased burden on the maintainers, so
must be minimize that.

IOW, layered testing is not desirable as goal. Rather layered testing
is just a default setup, but we'd encourage contributors to run the
full set of CI jobs, especially if they are frequent contributors.
The more they run themselves, the less burden on subsystem maintainers
and Peter, and thus the better we all scale.

I don't think we should be structuring jobs around organizations. We
should be defining a set of desired jobs we wish to be able to run.
Any organization can bring a runner that is capable of running the
jobs and donate it to the QEMU project for our formal CI runner
The organization is not defining the job though - QEMU is  defining
the jobs we expect to have used for testing.

This is key because any contributor needs to be able to spin up an
identical envrionment to replicate any build failures. We don't want
runners for merge testing that are built as a blackbox by someone.
That is the single biggest painpoint with Peter's current merge
jobs - we can't easily replicate Peter's merge env even if we had
the matching hardware available.

Daniel
