I tried to strangle them in their crib, but failed.

object_initialize_child() and its users like sysbus_init_child_obj()
violate this rule: they add a child property to the subtree's parent.
Correct?

Textbook example is the 1:1 connection between device frontend and
backend: block frontend's property "drive", char frontend's property
"chardev", NIC frontend property "netdev", ...

Can we come up with some guardrails for what property setting may do?
Affecting guest-visible state is off limits.  What else is?

One possible answer the question what should be done in realize() is
whatever must not be done earlier.  Is that the best we can do?
