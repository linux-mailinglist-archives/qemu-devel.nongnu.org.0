This is my prefered way. I think it's pretty simple and explicitly
follows the spec.

I don't prefer this option, but if others feel strongly I'm not
completely opposed to it.

My preference would be the "target/riscv: Update check for
Zca/zcf/zcd" patch, which I think is what you picked. So that seems
like the way to go

That's also fine
