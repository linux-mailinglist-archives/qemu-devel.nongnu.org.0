We usually refer the datasheet in the implementation header, see:

$ git grep -F .pdf hw/ | wc -l
62

You can cite the datasheet globally in hw/arm/allwinner-h3.c, and then=20
the particular chapters or source files in the other hw/*/allwinner-* files=
.

See docs/microvm.rst which is a recent example of machine documentation,
the obvious name is docs/orangepi.rst.

Maybe refer to this file in hw/arm/orangepi.c header for completeness.

Documentation is certainly welcome!

There are 2 different schools over the codebase, one that document the=20
declarations, and another that documents the implementation/definition.

I personally prefer to document the headers, which is where I look when=20
I want to consume an API.
The implementation school says this can lead to documentation getting=20
outdated.

So if you are willing to document, I'd suggest to document your=20
include/hw/ files.

Happy new year!

Phil.
