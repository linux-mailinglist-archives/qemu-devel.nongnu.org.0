I think oss-fuzz is using a bleeding edge version of Clang, so that
might not be a problem.
Here is the oss-fuzz build-log from earlier today:
https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/log-1747e14f-6b87-43e0-96aa-07ea159e7eb2.txt

...
Step #4: C compiler for the host machine: clang (clang 12.0.0 "clang version 12.0.0 (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git c9f69ee7f94cfefc373c3c6cae08e51b11e6d3c2)")
Step #4: C linker for the host machine: clang ld.bfd 2.26.1
Step #4: Host machine cpu family: x86_64
...

I'm not sure what the status of LTO/LLD support is on oss-fuzz/libfuzzer. There
are some sparse mentions of lld/lto in the repo:
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/933
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/3597

I haven't found any projects actively using lld on oss-fuzz, but I might
not be grepping hard enough. I personally haven't tried building the
fuzzers with LTO yet, but it seems like a good idea. I'll try it out.
