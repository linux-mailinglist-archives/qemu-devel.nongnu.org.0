Whoops. Yep, no good to go from one kind of broken to a different kind 
of broken.

Yeah, honestly I'm a bit confused about the error plumbing myself. We 
like to return "None" a lot, and I have been trying to remove that 
whenever possible, because the nature of what None can mean semantically 
is ambiguous.

I need to sit down with this code and learn all of the different ways it 
can actually and genuinely fail, and what each failure actually 
semantically means.

I suspect it would probably be best to always catch socket errors and 
wrap them in QMPConnectError just to be consistent about that.

I also need to revise the docstrings to be clear about what errors get 
raised where, when, and why. I almost included that for this series, but 
decided against it because I need to also adjust the docstring 
formatting and so on -- and pending discussion in the qapi series -- 
felt it would be best to tackle that just a little bit later.

Here's a docstring convention question:

I think that any method that directly raises an exception should always 
mention that with :raise X:. How far up the call chain, however, should 
anticipated exceptions be documented with :raise:?

My gut feeling is that it should stop at the first public call boundary, 
so accept() should repeat any :raise: comments that appear in private 
helpers.

Thanks for the review! Things seem like they're looking good.
