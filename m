But in those cases where a later option takes priority, at least those
that I'm thinking of right now, it actually completely overrides the
first option as if it hadn't been given.

This one seems to be different in that a later option actually just adds
to the list. Processing a list backwards isn't necessarily less
confusing than what we have.
