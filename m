Hi Maxim,

Thanks much for your reply.

It is still not clear to me why GPAs are not the same as the
corresponding HVAs in my experiment. Since two-dimensional paging
(Intel EPT) is used, GPAs should be the same as their corresponding
HVAs. Otherwise, I think EPT may not work correctly. What do you
think?

Thanks,
Harry
