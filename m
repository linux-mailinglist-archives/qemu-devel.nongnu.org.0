Not really. What I meant here is that the device which originally
creates the clock is the only device which can interact with the clock.
And it will never gives this right to another device even if
qdev_pass_clock() is used.

There are 2 interactions, depending on the clock direction (input or
output). If it is an input clock, it can register a callback on
frequency changes; and if it is an output clock, it can updates the
frequency of the clock.
