Are you sure about that ?

The EGD impl looks like it is requesting entropy in an async manner.

Any problem with rng-random would also affect rng-builtin, as depending
on platform / build options,  rng-builtin may just use /dev/urandom
directly.  It should only block with /dev/random really and that's only
with Linux's impl of /dev/random - some OS effectively have /dev/random
behave identically to /dev/urandom.

Daniel
