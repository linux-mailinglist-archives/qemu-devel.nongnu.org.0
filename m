/me wonders what gnome shell is doing there ...

It is the number of scatter list entries for resources.  Even in the worst =
case (no chunks are continous in memory so each single page needs an entry)=
 this is enough for 64 MB.  An 4k display
framebuffer needs less than that.

Removing the limit isn't an option.  Raising maybe.

Title:
  "nr_entries is too big" when using virgl

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I have a bootable image where GNOME Shell fails because it hits a
  limit in virtio-gpu.

  In `hw/display/virtio-gpu.c`, there is a limit for `nr_entries` at
  16384. There is no explanation for that limit. But there does not seem
  to be any limit on the kernel side.

  Raising this limit with a patch to 262144 solves the issue.

  Could there be an explanation why this limit is needed? And why this
  value? Or could this limit be just removed?
