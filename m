For microwatt I was going to implement HW support as well via JTAG
but the user linux-user bits are less obviously useful to me.

That said, most of that code can trivially be made arch neutral by
replacing the use of the arch specific CPU type with CPUState as
the first argument to most functions. There are only a handful of arch
specific helpers needed from there to extract the op & arg, set the
result etc..

It will be on microwatt once I add support for it. We could probably
make it work on real power9 if the systems give access to the external
debug facilities of the processor as well. I'm no longer involved with
powerpc in a professional capacity but I can ask Anton or Paul to help
there.

Cheers,
Ben.
