I think patches 1 and 3 are good to be committed either way if people
think they are useful. They make sense without the async snapshot code.

My concern with the interface in patch 2 is both that it could give
people a false sense of security and that it would be tempting to write
inefficient code.

Usually, you won't have just a single call into the block layer for a
given block node, but you'll perform multiple operations. Switching to
the target context once rather than switching back and forth in every
operation is obviously more efficient.

But chances are that even if one of these function is bdrv_flush(),
which now works correctly from a different thread, you might need
another function that doesn't implement the same magic. So you always
need to be aware which functions support cross-context calls which
ones don't.

I feel we'd see a few bugs related to this.

Yes, there is no doubt that this is useful functionality. There has been
talk about this every now and then, but I don't think we ever got to a
point where it actually could be implemented.

Vladimir, I seem to remember you (or someone else from your team?) were
interested in async snapshots as well a while ago?

It doesn't even look that bad in terms of patch size. I had imagined it
a bit larger.

But it seems this is not really just an async 'savevm' (which would save
the VM state in a qcow2 file), but you store the state in a separate
raw file. What is the difference between this and regular migration into
a file?

I remember people talking about how snapshotting can store things in a
way that a normal migration stream can't do, like overwriting outdated
RAM state instead of just appending the new state, but you don't seem to
implement something like this.
