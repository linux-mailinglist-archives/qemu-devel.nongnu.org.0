Yes, testing is done in a loop.

I made an experiment where I started MAC OSX 10.4 in QEMU system mode 
and I found out that vpkpx instruction is widely used to display 
different graphical elements. With that in mind, this performance 
improvement is of great importance.

Also, vpkpx instruction is often used in a loop, to process big amount 
of pixels at once. That's why testing performance of this instruction in 
a loop should give good insight of how this instruction perform overall.

Kind Regards,

Stefan
