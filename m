The QEMU CLI may sometimes be confusing?!?  I'm shocked, sir, I'm
shocked!

Of course we should consider reasonable user expectations.

Grumpy aside: when I do, I commonly run into objections that users
reasonably expect things not to change.

My preferred way to address QemuOpts parsing madness is replacing it
wholesale by keyval.c, but that's some time off, I'm afraid.

This series merely aims for more method to the same old madness.
