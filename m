Great, thanks for testing!

Yeah.

I completely agree with your analysis and solution.

So, for now we need to patch vhost-vsock-pci and vhost-user-vsock-pci,
and queue the patches in stable.

Do you prefer to send them? Otherwise I can do that.

Thanks again for the help and the test with s390x guest!
