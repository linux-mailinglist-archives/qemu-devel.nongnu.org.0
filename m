This is (QMP).

This is (HMP-CO).

This is (OOB).

To get 1. (QMP) and 2, (HMP-CO) at the same time, the in-band,
non-coroutine QMP command needs to execute interleaved with the in-band,
coroutine HMP command.

Such an interleaving contradicts "In-band execution is one command after
the other", which is a fundamental assumption in-band commands may make.
If the assumption is invalid, we got a problem.  Is it?

Correct.  I decided to go with the code you already tested.
