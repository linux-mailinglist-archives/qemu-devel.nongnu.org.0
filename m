I played with this for the PMU, i.e. I removed 'has_pmu' and used its bits
in id_aa64dfr0. Everything worked, so it's possible. I think the changes
to convert the PMU, VFP, and NEON are too far outside the scope of this
series to do them now, but I'll attempt to add a has-sve boolean without
adding a "has_sve" boolean in this series by using id_aa64pfr0.
