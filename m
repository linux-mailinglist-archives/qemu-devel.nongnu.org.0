Error.h's big comment:

 * Error reporting system loosely patterned after Glib's GError.
 *
 * =3D Rules =3D
 [...]
 * - Whenever practical, also return a value that indicates success /
 *   failure.  This can make the error checking more concise, and can
 *   avoid useless error object creation and destruction.  Note that
 *   we still have many functions returning void.  We recommend
 *   =E2=80=A2 bool-valued functions return true on success / false on fail=
ure,
 *   =E2=80=A2 pointer-valued functions return non-null / null pointer, and
 *   =E2=80=A2 integer-valued functions return non-negative / negative.

blk_log_writes_find_cur_log_sector() does return such an error value
before the patch: (uint64_t)-1.

The caller does not use it to check for errors.  It uses @err instead.
Awkward, has to error_propagate().

Avoiding error_propagate() reduces the error handling boileplate.  It
also improves behavior when @errp is &error_abort: we get the abort
right where the error happens instead of where we propagate it.

Furthermore, caller has to make an error code (-EINVAL), because
returning (uint64_t)-1 throws it away.  Yes, a detailed error is stored
into @err, but you can't cleanly extract the error code.

Using a signed integer for returning "non-negative offset or negative
errno code" is pervasive, starting with read() and write().  It hasn't
been a problem there, and it hasn't been a problem in the block layer.
8 exbi-blocks should do for a while.  Should it become troublesome, we
won't solve the problem by going unsigned and adding one bit, we'll
double the width and add 64.

Additional rationale for returning recognizable error values:

    error: Document Error API usage rules
   =20
    This merely codifies existing practice, with one exception: the rule
    advising against returning void, where existing practice is mixed.
   =20
    When the Error API was created, we adopted the (unwritten) rule to
    return void when the function returns no useful value on success,
    unlike GError, which recommends to return true on success and false on
    error then.
   =20
    When a function returns a distinct error value, say false, a checked
    call that passes the error up looks like
   =20
        if (!frobnicate(..., errp)) {
            handle the error...
        }
   =20
    When it returns void, we need
   =20
        Error *err =3D NULL;
   =20
        frobnicate(..., &err);
        if (err) {
            handle the error...
            error_propagate(errp, err);
        }
   =20
    Not only is this more verbose, it also creates an Error object even
    when @errp is null, &error_abort or &error_fatal.
   =20
    People got tired of the additional boilerplate, and started to ignore
    the unwritten rule.  The result is confusion among developers about
    the preferred usage.
   =20
    Make the rule advising against returning void official by putting it
    in writing.  This will hopefully reduce confusion.

    error: New macro ERRP_GUARD()
   =20
    Introduce a new ERRP_GUARD() macro, to be used at start of functions
    with an errp OUT parameter.
   =20
    It has three goals:
   =20
    1. Fix issue with error_fatal and error_prepend/error_append_hint: the
    user can't see this additional information, because exit() happens in
    error_setg earlier than information is added. [Reported by Greg Kurz]
   =20
    2. Fix issue with error_abort and error_propagate: when we wrap
    error_abort by local_err+error_propagate, the resulting coredump will
    refer to error_propagate and not to the place where error happened.
    (the macro itself doesn't fix the issue, but it allows us to [3.] drop
    the local_err+error_propagate pattern, which will definitely fix the
    issue) [Reported by Kevin Wolf]
   =20
    3. Drop local_err+error_propagate pattern, which is used to workaround
    void functions with errp parameter, when caller wants to know resulting
    status. (Note: actually these functions could be merely updated to
    return int error code).

We assign the error code returned by
blk_log_writes_find_cur_log_sector(), which seems proper to me.

Care to suggest a better variable name?

I prefer this patch.  But it's up to the block maintainers.
