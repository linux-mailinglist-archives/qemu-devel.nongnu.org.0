AFAICT from testing it, when '--system-site-packages' is set
for the venv, then 'pip install' appears to end up being a
no-op if the package is already present in the host, but
installs it if missing.

IOW, if we default to --system-site-packages, but still
also run 'pip install', we should "do the right thing".
It'll use any  distro packages that are available, and
augment with stuff from pip. In the no-op case, pip will
still try to consult the pipy servers to fetch version
info IIUC, so we need to be able to stop that. So I'd
suggest a  --python-env arg taking three values

 * "auto" (the default) - add --system-site-packages, but
   also run 'pip install'. Good for developers day-to-day

 * "system" - add --system-site-packages but never run
   'pip install'.  Good for formal package builds.

 * "pip"  - don't add --system-site-packages, always run
   'pip install'. Good for testing compatibility with
   bleeding edge python versions, or if explicit full
   independance from host python install is desired.

With regards,
Daniel
