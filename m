Right.  I should say "bitmap to track ...".  I'll reword.

Right.  It seems a bit awkward to use that directly.  Also note that
the other value can be different with this one when it's illegal
(e.g., bigger than CLEAR_BITMAP_SHIFT_MAX or smaller than
CLEAR_BITMAP_SHIFT_MIN).  This value will always be legal and we don't
need to check/assert it every time.

(Hmm, could bmap_shift be different for different ramblocks?  I never
 thought about that but actually, it can, of course)
