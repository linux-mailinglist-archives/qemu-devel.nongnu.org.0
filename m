This series adds a new tool 'qemu-storage-daemon', which can be used to
export and perform operations on block devices. There is some overlap
between qemu-img/qemu-nbd and the new qemu-storage-daemon, but there are
a few important differences:

* The qemu-storage-daemon has QMP support. The command set is obviously
  restricted compared to the system emulator because there is no guest,
  but all of the block operations are present.

  This means that it can access advanced options or operations that the
  qemu-img command line doesn't expose. For example, blockdev-create is
  a lot more powerful than 'qemu-img create', and qemu-storage-daemon
  allows to execute it without starting a guest.

  Compared to qemu-nbd it means that, for example, block jobs can now be
  executed on the server side, and backing chains shared by multiple VMs
  can be modified this way.

* The existing tools all have a separately invented one-off syntax for
  the job at hand, which usually comes with restrictions compared to the
  system emulator. qemu-storage-daemon shares the same syntax with the
  system emulator for most options and prefers QAPI based interfaces
  where possible (such as --blockdev), so it should be easy to make use
  of in libvirt.

* While this series implements only NBD exports, the storage daemon is
  intended to serve multiple protocols and its syntax reflects this. In
  the past, we had proposals to add new one-off tools for exporting over
  new protocols like FUSE or TCMU.

  With a generic storage daemon, additional export methods have a home
  without adding a new tool for each of them.

I'm posting this as an RFC mainly for two reasons:

1. The monitor integration, which could be argued to be a little hackish
   (some generated QAPI source files are built from a separate QAPI
   schema, but the per-module ones are taken from the system emulator)
   and Markus will want to have a closer look there. But from the IRC
   discussions we had, we seem to agree on the general approach here.

2. I'm not completely sure if the command line syntax is the final
   version that we want to support long-term. Many options directly use
   QAPI visitors (--blockdev, --export, --nbd-server) and should be
   fine. However, others use QemuOpts (--chardev, --monitor, --object).

   This is the same as in the system emulator, so we wouldn't be adding
   a new problem, but as there was talk about QAPIfying the command
   line, and I wouldn't want later syntax changes or adding lots of
   compatibility code to a new tool, I thought we should probably
   discuss whether QAPIfying from the start would be an option.

I would like to have something merged for 4.2, but I'm considering
marking the whole tool as experimental and unstable ABI by requiring a
command line option like --experimental for the tool to even start if we
know that we want to change some things later.

This series is based on:
* [PATCH] blockdev: Use error_report() in hmp_commit()
* [PATCH 0/7] qapi: Cleanups and test speedup
