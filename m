Instead of just asserting that no requests are in flight in
bdrv_replace_node(), which is a requirement that most callers ignore, we
can just drain the source node right there. This fixes at least starting
a commit job while I/O is active on the backing chain, but probably
other callers, too.

Having requests in flight on the target node isn't a problem because the
target just gets new parents, but the call path of running requests
isn't modified. So we can just drop this assertion without a replacement.

Fixes: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1711643
