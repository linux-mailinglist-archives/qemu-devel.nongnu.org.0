For 64 kB clusters, I have on XFS:
- with: 30.3 - 31.3 MB/s
- without: 27.4 - 27.9 MB/s

On ext4:
- with: 34.9 - 36.4 MB/s
- without: 33.8 - 38 MB/s

For good measure, 2 MB clusters with aio=3Dthreads (but still O_DIRECT) on
XFS:
- with: 25.7 MB/s - 27.0 MB/s
- without: 24.6 MB/s - 26.7 MB/s

On ext4:
- with: 16.7 MB/s - 19.3 MB/s
- without: 16.3 MB/s - 18.4 MB/s

(Note that the difference between ext4 and XFS is probably just because
these are two different systems with different SSDs.)

So there is little difference, if any significant at all (those were all
just three test runs).  There does seem to be a bit of a drift for
aio=3Dthreads, but then again it=E2=80=99s also just much slower than aio=
=3Dnative
for ext4.

(Also note that I ran this on an unfixed kernel.  Maybe the XFS fix will
slow things down, but I haven=E2=80=99t tested that yet.)

So unless there are realistic guest benchmarks for ext4 that say we
should keep the patch, I=E2=80=99m going to queue the revert for now (=E2=
=80=9Cnow=E2=80=9D =3D
4.1.1 and 4.2.0).
