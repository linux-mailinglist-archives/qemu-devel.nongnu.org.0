I got the latest DSDT from one of the latest builds 19041

     Device (\_SB.VMOD.VMBS)
     {
         Name (STA, 0x0F)
         Name (_ADR, Zero)  // _ADR: Address
         Name (_DDN, "VMBUS")  // _DDN: DOS Device Name
         Name (_HID, "VMBus")  // _HID: Hardware ID
         Name (_UID, Zero)  // _UID: Unique ID
         Method (_DIS, 0, NotSerialized)  // _DIS: Disable Device
         {
             STA &= 0x0D
         }

         Method (_PS0, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PS0: Power State 0
         {
             STA |= 0x0F
         }

         Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)  // _STA: Status
         {
             Return (STA) /* \_SB_.VMOD.VMBS.STA_ */
         }

         Name (_PS3, Zero)  // _PS3: Power State 3
         Name (_CRS, ResourceTemplate ()  // _CRS: Current Resource Settings
         {
             IRQ (Edge, ActiveHigh, Exclusive, )
                 {5}
         })
     }

So things looks the same...
