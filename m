Hi Ben and Jonathan,

Thanks for your replies. I'm looking forward to the patches.

For QEMU, I see hotplug support as an item on the list and would like to=20
start working on it. It would be great if you can provide some pointers=20
about how I should go about it.
Also, which version of kernel and QEMU (maybe Jonathan's upcoming version)=
=20
would be a good starting point for it?

Thanks,
Saransh

Hi Ben, Saransh

I have a forward port of the series + DOE etc to near current QEMU that is=
=20
lightly tested,
and can look to push that out publicly later this week.

I'd also like to push QEMU support forwards and to start getting this=20
upstream in QEMU
+ fill in some of the missing parts.

Was aiming to make progress on this a few weeks ago, but as ever other=20
stuff
got in the way.

+CC qemu-devel in case anyone else also looking at this.

Jonathan
