the plan was/still is to have memdev for main ram and deprecate
"-numa node,mem=3D..." for new machine types (can't be done for
old ones due to migration breakages and old libvirt which uses
it). So new machines will be forced to use "-numa memdev"
For old machines '-m memdev' provided memory region will used to
keep "-numa node,mem=3D..." working as it's now (however broken it is).
