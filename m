Not really. Since we can't simply remove sve-max-vq from the 'max' cpu
type, then we'd still need conditions to check when we can use it. The
restriction that it has to come first reduces the complexity
substantially, and I think restricting to not being allowed
at all, when sve<vl-bits> are used, would only give us a net check
reduction of one or two.

I don't want to put any final checks at the end of parsing all options,
because that won't work with the QMP query.

I can't think of any issue with the parsing, but the QMP query only using
the property get accessors, without any finalizing, does put constraints
on what we can do.

sve-max-vq already exists, so it'd have to be deprecated if we don't want
it anymore. And I think sve<vl-bits> is the right naming to go with for
that. Of course using sve-max-vq is completely optional. If you don't want
it for backward compatible reasons, or as a shorthand to restrict the
lengths, then you can just use the sve<vl-bits> properties. Indeed, with
KVM, if you use the 'host' cpu type (the default for use with KVM), then
you won't even have the sve-max-vq property. As 'host' never had it, I
didn't have to keep it, nor adopt it. And of course I didn't want to
adopt it.

Thanks,
