Does this reply add that tag already or do I need to submit a v2 with it 
(or the maintainer could add it when merging)?

I've tried that first but it does not work. The reason is that ati_mm_read 
is recursively called for indexed access via MM_DATA which causes the 
problem that happens when MM_INDEX is set to a non-aligned value. No 64 
bit access, just 32 bit with offset of 2 bytes as can be seen from the 
stach trace I've attached to the bug. Fortunately indexed access is 
documented to only support aligned access by not allowing setting low bits 
of MM_INDEX so unless we find a client needing it my patch should do it.

I think this would not work either because not all registers are the same, 
some only can be read all 32 bits, some also 16 or 8 bits and clients do 
access these with less than 32 bits and accessing parts of the reg may 
trigger actions so the current way is probably better and necessary to 
correctly support different valid and invalid unaligned accessses.
