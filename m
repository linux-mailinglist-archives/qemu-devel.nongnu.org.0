Hello, Paolo!

Thank you for your answer. I would like to clarify something about the =
qmp
commands.
For example, consider SCSI controller "lsi53c895a". For getting =
information
we use two commands: "device-list-properties" and "qom-list-properties".
Output consists of many properties, but there is no information about
provided buses by this device. Is there a qmp command which provides =
this
information?


Best regards,
Natalia

Hi!

Bus data is implicit in the parent class provided by QMP.  For example,
pci-device is the superclass of PCI devices, scsi-device is the
superclass of SCSI devices, etc.

qgraph is indeed similar, but it is only used by test cases, not by QEMU
itself.  The difference is that qgraph links together _drivers_ for the
devices, and so it is limited to those devices that have tests.  For
some ideas behind qgraph, see
https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/qtest_driver_framework.
