I don't think that's very helpful description. The HMP interface has
some limitations, but it isn't bonkers - it just doesn't cope with
all the use cases we want. Many people use it succesfully without
issue

Yes, I guess so.

Yes, replacing is quite likely to be a mistake.

"@force" could mean many things, so "replace-existing: bool" is
probably a clearer name.

Yes, the actual snapshot is synchronous with return of the command.

This ties in with the previous point. If feel if we don't document
the use of events here, then people are likely to blindly assume
synchronous completion. By explicitly telling them to wait for the
JOB_STATUS_CHANGE they are nudged towards a correct solution that
won't break if it becomes async later.

I don't know when I'll have time, as I've not looked at just how
complex the conversion is. It is *highly* desirable to fix this
otherwise debugging failures is an exercise in extreme pain through
lack of useful information.

Both of these makes QEMU just "do the right thing" with the majority
of QEMU guest configurations with no special knowledge needed by
the mgmt app.

It makes it possible for all existing apps to immediately stop using
the loadvm/savevm commands via HMP passthrough, and convert to the
QMP commands.

Without this, applications will need to first convert to use -blockdev
before they can use the load-snapshot/save-snapshot commands, because
the devices are specified exclusively using blockdev node names, not
the legacy drive IDs. I didn't want to make blockdev a mandatory
dependancy unless apps want to opt-in to the fine grained control
over disk choices

I feel it is more important to be symetric with save-snapshot.  ie if you
supply or omit the same args for save-snapshot and load-snapshot, you
know both will work, or neither will work. You dont get into a situation
where you can succesfully save the snapshot, but not restore it.

I guess it can abort if the file is corrupt perhaps. Generally
thogh if the named snapshot doesnt exist in the block device, it
is considered success, not an error.
