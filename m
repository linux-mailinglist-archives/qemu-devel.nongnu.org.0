Yes.  Notable exceptions: containers /machine/peripheral,
/machine/peripheral-anon, /machine/unattached.

We sometimes use object_new() + object_property_add_child() instead.
Extra indirection.  I guess we'd be better off without the extra
indirection most of the time.  Implementation detail.

We sometimes use object_new() without object_property_add_child(), and
have qdev_realize() put the device in the /machine/unattached orphanage.
Meh.  I guess the orphanage feature exists to make conversion to QOM
slightly easier.  Could we ban its use for new boards at least?

Plugged devices (the ones created with -device / device_add) have
/machine/peripheral or /machine/peripheral-anon as QOM parent.

True, but only because QOM's design opts for generality, efficiency be
damned :)

The QOM graph's edges are properties.

The child edges form the QOM composition tree.  The property contains
the child in ObjectProperty member @opaque.  To go from parent to child,
you have to get the property by name (hash table lookup), then follow
@opaque.  Except that would be too simple (and way too efficient), so we
convert pointers to QOM path names and back with visitors for accessing
a single child, or iterate over all properties (hash table iteration)
for accessing all children.

There is also a pointer from child back to parent, which is not a
property.  That one is actually fast and easy to use from C.

The remaining QOM graph edges are link edges.  Compared to child edges,
there's a further indirection through the LinkProperty struct, and no
support for iterating over link edge targets.

This design supports adding arbitrary children and links at run time,
with the actual object none the wiser.

A less general and more efficient design would put pointers right into
the objects' structs, then wrap what we call class properties around the
pointers.  C code for specific objects could then simply follow the
pointers.  Generic code could still use properties.  If efficiency
matters there, we could avoid the detour through path names.

Properties backed by a (pointer-valued) struct member are less general,
of course: you can't add this kind of property without first adding the
struct member.  The property needs to be declared at compile time rather
than built at run time.

I never quite understood why we need to build properties at run time.
It's makes reasoning about properties harder, and introspection brittle.
