This series of patches adds support for 8 bit Atmel (Microchip) AVR microcontrollers.
All documented instructions except DES, SPM, and WDR are implemented.
These patches include very incomplete peripheral emulation, and only a single example board definition.

All instructions except LAC, LAS, LAT, XCH, BREAK, and SLEEP have been tested by comparing their behaviours against hardware.
The test programs used were designed specifically to exercise as many instruction variants as possible.
More details, source code, and results are available here: https://github.com/seharris/qemu-avr-tests/tree/master/instruction-tests

Additionally, it has been confirmed that this emulation can run FreeRTOS (an open source realtime operating system).
AVRs don't have memory management hardware and typically only have a few kilobytes of RAM so booting something more standard, e.g. Linux, wasn't feasible.
Two peripherals were needed (USART and 16 bit timer) for this test and are included in these patches.
The implementations are somewhat limited, mostly because QEMU doesn't seem to have much in the way of facilities to handle low-level electrical interfaces like GPIO pins.
A simple LED indicator peripheral was also used, but is not included because it isn't likely to be generally useful.
The FreeRTOS build and LED patch are available here: https://github.com/seharris/qemu-avr-tests/tree/master/free-rtos

These patches are based on work by Michael Rolnik, last discussed here in 2017: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-06/msg02290.html
This series is derived from the version found in this repository: https://github.com/michaelrolnik/qemu-avr
Changes from that version:
- rebase onto current master
- fixes for some accumulated bitrot (including a crash at startup)
- minor improvements to sample board firmware loading
- fixes for bugs in instruction translations (POP, ASR, LSR, ROR, FMUL, FMULS, FMULSU, MUL, MULS, MULSU, OR, SBC, SBCI)
- new instruction decoder to avoid some awkward dependencies
- general cleanup (style fixes, fixing unclear comments, making code easier to follow)

On a personal note, I'm unfamiliar with this style of submission so I hope I haven't broken anything!
