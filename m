Hi David,

Thanks for your quick response!

Completely agree. I've revisited that section many times now and still=20
find the descriptions of these properties almost incomprehensible.

The only way I've been able to make sense of it comes from reading the=20
implementation, or experimentally tweaking the code/device tree to see=20
if distances behave the way I expect.

Sure, that makes sense. I'll try making the change conditional on a flag=20
that can be set on new machine types.

Again, I'm no authority but it seems to be (b):

   "To determine the associativity between any two resources, the OS
scans down the two resources associativity lists in all pair wise=20
combinations counting how many domains are the same until the first=20
domain where the two list do not agree."

FWIW, using the same number for id at multiple levels has been working=20
in practice.

It's not necessary to use it at all levels--that was me trying to=20
completely replicate that old firmware change. Strictly speaking, since=20
only reference-points 4 (and now 2) are significant, that part could=20
just be:

@@ -362,7 +362,7 @@ void spapr_phb_nvgpu_ram_populate_dt(SpaprPhbState *sph=
b, void *fdt)
          uint32_t associativity[] =3D {
              cpu_to_be32(0x4),
              SPAPR_GPU_NUMA_ID,
-            SPAPR_GPU_NUMA_ID,
+            cpu_to_be32(nvslot->numa_id),
              SPAPR_GPU_NUMA_ID,
              cpu_to_be32(nvslot->numa_id)
          };

I think the rationale is that if those other levels got added to=20
reference-points in the future, you'd likely want the GPU to be distinct=20
there too.
