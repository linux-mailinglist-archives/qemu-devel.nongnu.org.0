	This is very similar to our multi-process QEMU implementation =
before
we looked into using muser.  The differences are:

We use one object per emulated device type in QEMU rather than having a =
single
VFIO type that can masquerade as any PCI device.

We don=E2=80=99t pin guest memory; we pass the QEMU file descriptors =
used to create
guest memory to the emulation program, and it mmap()s them itself. (ala
vhost-user).
