Hm, doesn't it make sense in a way for qmp_block_resize() at least? It
means that you can't resize just a filter, but you need to resize the
image that actually provides the data for the filter.

Of course, there is no reason for it to be the _first_ non-filter as
long as BLK_PERM_RESIZE is shared, but just some non-filter node.

Two more random observations:

* quorum uses bdrv_filter_default_perms(), which allows BLK_PERM_RESIZE.
  I think this is wrong and quorum should make sure that all children are
  always the same size because otherwise it can't tell what its own size
  is. (Or vote on size...? :-/) Probably not a problem in practice as
  long as we check bdrv_is_first_non_filter().

* child_file and child_backing don't implement .resize. So if you resize
  a non-top-level image, parents (in particular filters) don't get their
  size adjusted. This is probably a bug, too, but one that isn't
  prevented by bdrv_is_first_non_filter() and should be visible today.

Never mind, I just didn't understand that .is_filter is the thing that
defines a R/W filter. In fact, I didn't really understand what
=2Eis_filter was supposed to mean at all because I was so confused. For
some reason I was sure it had to mean any kind of filter, but that
assumption just didn't match up with its use at all.

Yes, I wrote "nodes", thought "child nodes" and should have said
"children" because edges are not nodes. My bad, sorry.

No, certainly not. If my mails seemed confusing or pointless, it just
shows how thoroughly confused I was.

Well, I saw that the special cases in the patches that I had reviewed so
far seemed to be converted correctly, but I just didn't understand the
whole concept behind it. It's possible to both understand that a
transformation is correct and to fail to grasp the concept behind it.

And your first answer only confused me more because you gave definitions
for R/W and COW filters that honestly ended up a bit misleading,
possibly as a result of your endeavour to make R/W filters and COW
sound like the same thing. (Which made me lose sight of basic facts like
that R/W filters must forward _every_ request without exception to their
filtered child even though COW doesn't.)

Aye.

I agree, and this is the condition that I mentioned somewhere above, but
failed to actually find guaranteed somewhere. We should probably make
this explicit.

Of course, quorum and similar things intend all their children to
provide the same data, but the whole point of the driver is that this is
not always guaranteed, so they aren't actually filters.
