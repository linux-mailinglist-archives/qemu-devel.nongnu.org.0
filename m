Any new connections to qmp will be accept()ed and show the greeting
({"QMP":{"version"...}}), but not respond to any messages sent
afterwards (though in my tests sometimes (after a few more attempts to
reconnect/talk to the same qmp socket), not even the greeting would
appear anymore).

We can't, because suspend()/resume() employ a counter, which would
become unbalanced and could easily become negative by queuing a command
without filling the queue up and quickly disconnecting.

We'd still need to make sure the suspend counter is balanced out with
the corresponding suspend() calls.
