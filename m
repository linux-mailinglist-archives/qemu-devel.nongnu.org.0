Reply-to: Cameron Esfahani <dirty@apple.com>

I had a look at this failing test case after running applying Cedric's =
patch =
(https://github.com/legoater/qemu/commit/d57ac950c4be47a2bafd6c6a96dec2922=
c2ecd65).

It looks like this is just a bug in the test case.  The test case is =
attempting to verify that the CNF registers are programmed correctly by =
sampling the first and last CNF register.  The bug is that =
NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END doesn't actually refer to the start of the last =
valid CNF register.  It refers to the last byte of the last valid CNF =
register.  So either NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END needs to be adjusted to =
0x77C or we need to subtract 3 to get to the start of the register.  =
Considering the NRF51 doesn't appear to support unaligned access, it =
seems like changing NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END to 0x77C is reasonable.

Here's a patch which seems to fix it for me:

diff --git a/include/hw/gpio/nrf51_gpio.h b/include/hw/gpio/nrf51_gpio.h
index 337ee53..1d62bbc 100644

Considering this change works for pre-Cedric patch and post, I'll post =
at official version shortly.

And hopefully this unblocks review of Cedric's patch...
