Feel free to call that pain however you want.  I'm going to call it
"lasting aftereffects of the flag day" :)

The fact that we all need to cope with this class of issue doesn't mean
we should create more instances unthinkingly.

We should only when we believe the benefits are worth it, and can't find
a cheaper way to get them.

We've discussed "is it really that bad" at some length.  What I'm
missing so far is a clear writeup of the benefits beyond "editor works
out of the box" (which is quite a desirable benefit, but can also be had
without a flag day).
