Yep, checking that it is really a FD is sufficient to avoid the
assert in nonblock.

As for whether it is really a tap device, I think we just need to
improve error reporting of the functions that come later, instead
of doing a literal "is it a tap" check.

That's what I'd tried in my old patch from a few years back

   https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10029443/

I can't remember why we didn't merge this back then
