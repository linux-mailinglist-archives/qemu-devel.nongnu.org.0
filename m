I am still running into this issue when compiling QEMU on Windows using
MSYS2. I can manually apply the fix per the Capstone commit above and
compile just fine.

For moving forward, how should this be handled in the codebase to get
the MSYS2 build cleanly working? I imagine wholesale pulling the latest
Capstone may break quite a bit. Is it possible to cherry-pick this one
change into the submodule?

Title:
  Compilation on MSYS2/MinGW-w64 fails with error: "No rule to make
  target capstone.lib"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I submitted this bug to Capstone directly but I figured it'd be useful
  to post it here too. The IS_MINGW check in the Makefile for Capstone
  fails under MSYS2 MinGW-w64 because cc --version doesn't have mingw in
  the output anymore:

  $ whereis cc
  cc: /mingw64/bin/cc.exe

  $ cc --version
  cc.exe (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 8.3.0
