Well, we try, at least.  At least we hide them from query-block.

The theory is that qemu may decide to add nodes at any point, but at
least when managing chains etc., they may not be visible to the user.  I
don=E2=80=99t think we can get rid of them so easily.

One example that isn=E2=80=99t implemented yet is copy-on-read.  In theor=
y,
specifying copy-on-read=3Don for -drive should create an implicit COR nod=
e
on top.  The user shouldn=E2=80=99t see that node when inspecting the dri=
ve or
when issuing block jobs on it, etc.  And this node has to stay there
when the user does e.g. an active commit somewhere down the chain.

That sounds like a horrible ordeal to implement, so it hasn=E2=80=99t bee=
n done
yet.  Maybe it never will.  It isn=E2=80=99t that bad for the job filters=
,
because they generally freeze the block graph, so there is no problem
with potential modifications.

All in all I do think having implicit nodes makes sense.  Maybe not so
much now, but in the future (if someone implements converting -drive COR
and throttle options to implicit nodes...).

Hm.  Backup job actually doesn=E2=80=99t sound that wrong.

[1] Thinking more about this, for normal backups the target file does
not reflect a valid disk state until the backup is done; just like for
qemu-img convert.  Just like qemu-img convert, there is therefore no
reason to flush the target until the job is done.

But there is also the other case of image fleecing.  In this case, the
target will have another parent, so bdrv_flush_all() will be done by
someone.  Still, it intuitively makes sense to me that in this case, the
backup-top filter should flush the target if the guest decides to flush
the device (so that the target stays consistent on disk).

backup-top currently cannot differentiate between the cases, but maybe
that is generally a useful hint to give to it?  (That is, whether the
target has a consistent state or not.)

Oops.  My bad.
