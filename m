Hi Phil,

I think the issue on this thread was more on the server mirror side,
than on the *cache* side of things, right?  Still, it's an open issue
that needs to be discussed indeed.

I understand it has been a year, which is a lot of time specially when
it comes to an urgent need such as more and better testing and CI.
But some things can be patched quickly, while others need further
structural work.  More on that later...

What I can say is that the Avocado developers have been working
on a major overhaul to address those issues.  I'm not sure this
is the place/time to go over each of those items, but there may be
some confusion going on some of those issues.  For instance, your
point about "why download all artifacts to run a single test".
It shouldn't, and it doesn't:

  $ du -hcs ~/avocado/data/cache/

  JOB TIME   : 3.22 s

  $ du -hcs ~/avocado/data/cache/
  8.3M    /home/cleber/avocado/data/cache/
  8.3M    total

About Avocado being hard to understand, I'm a bit saddened by that,
because the team spent a lot of effort in:

 * Restructuring / rewriting / reviewing the documention
 * Normalizing the command line options
 * Deprecating and removing a lot of non-relevant functionality

I've probably said the same thing in a few different channels and
contexts, but for the last ~9 months, the Avocado project had been
working on a new architecture that was highly influenced by the
limitations we found while using Avocado in QEMU.  Version 82.0 was
the result of that work, and it'd be very bad timing if, instead of
integrating this "new Avocado", QEMU would start "from scratch" again.

I've been looking for an opportunity to present what this "new
Avocado" is.  Maybe this or another BoF would be a good place?

I understand this is your PoV with regards to how much value you
believe exists in those particular utility modules.  The challenge is
how to combine other people's PoV with regards to the same matter, and
manage them accordingly as a group.  One example is how Pavel Dovgaluk
may find the "gdb" utility module important.

Now consider that Red Hat is vested to have some of the functional /
integration tests that run downstream (and which are based on
Avocado+Avocado-VT) migrated upstreamed.  Then, all of a sudden, a
much larger group of "practical classes" arise.

Finally, these are, as you mentioned in another thread, utility
libraries (such as python/qemu) are commonly needed in other projects
(specially those related to QEMU).  I understand that suggesting to
have more code infrastructure code living in the QEMU would actually
make it harder to solve similar problems once.

Absolutely!
