The dependencies are not identical. Would you want two lines, one with the
shared dependencies, i.e. something like:

  libqemuutils.a libhost-user.a: $(util-obj-y) $(stub-obj-y)
  libqemuutils.a: $(trace-obj-y)
  libvhost-user.a: $(libvhost-user-obj-y)

Or do you mean something else?

I believe that what you are saying is that by passing the required libraries
automatically, the binaries that use libqemuutil.a will inherit undesired
ldd dependencies. Indeed, a quick experiment shows that if you pass a -l
option, the library dependency is recorded even if no symbol in that library
is used. I saw no obvious linker option to address that.

Maybe add a comment, then, because otherwise it is surprising to have an
unsat despite something like:

  foo.o-libs = -lbar

As I pointed out in my commit comment, there is at least one case where this
is used, dbus.o-libs, suggesting that this is expected to work. This seems
to be the only case that goes in util-obj-y today. Apparently, this works
because the link of qemu-system-x86_64 already gets $(GIO_LIBS) from
some .o file that is not going through libqemuutil.a

Yes. The alternative being that you get unsatisfied symbols if you do use
the .o file.

If that's the intent, then util/mp3encoder.o should ideally not be lumped
into the library. Otherwise, you will get unsatisfied symbols when you use
it through the library, but not when you use it directly.

One can certainly argue that it's better to have an explicit "unsatisfied
symbol" error than a silent addition of an unwanted library dependency. If
that's the consensus, then, just add a comment explaining how this works.

Given that discussion, I'm now inclined to believe that the correct solution
is:

a) add a comment in the makefile explaining that .o-libs flags are not
   passed through .a files with a pointer to this discussion.

b) remove the existing dbus.o-libs line which has no effect, to avoid
   monkey-do copy-paste inheritance
