Yea.

How much of this is due to 'rng-egd was not set up properly; the
backend did not appear in time' -- ie a setup problem; vs a problem we
can expect to recur?

The current patch affects *all* requests from the guest.  The problem
being seen though is just during the driver probe.  Is the current
patch doing much more than is required?  Say the device runs out of
randomness to provide after setup - the guest's read calls will just
block and remain killable.  It's the probe currently that is not
killable.

Other options to explore are:

1. Ensure setup is ready (ie the device's backend is set up before
plugging in the device), so that the device is ready to serve requests
as soon as it's plugged in

2. Make the add_early_randomness optional for virtio-rng.  (This is a
big hammer, and working around bad setup problems.)

Could be achieved via a control command?  But all that sounds quite
ugly (and also requires host+guest modification).
