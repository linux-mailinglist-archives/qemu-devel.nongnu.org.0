Ah.. yes, that one might be a bit tricky.

Well, we want to be robust and it's at least theoretically possible
that the guest will request different things on subsequent reboots.
However I believe that the original rationale for this check was that
while we could add things to the device tree for added capabilities,
we didn't have a way to roll back the changes for removed
capabilities.

Now that we fully rebuild the device tree at CAS, I think this test
can probably just go, although there's some double checking to do.
