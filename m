I'm basically fine with your patch, but let me ask one more thing: Won't we 
still have the problem if the user pushes to different branches 
simultaneously? E.g. the user pushes to "foo" with changes to dockerfiles, 
containers start to get rebuild, then pushes to master without waiting for 
the previous CI to finish, then the containers get rebuild from the "master" 
job without the local changes to the dockerfiles. Then in the "foo" CI 
pipelines the following jobs might run with the containers that have been 
built by the "master" job...

So if we really want to get it bulletproof, do we have to use the git branch 
name as the container image tag?
