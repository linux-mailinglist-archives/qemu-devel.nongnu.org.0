It may be for some, but it isn't for all, perhaps we should not =
generalise and get the wrong conclusions.

In the xPack Build Box (a set of Docker images) that I use for the =
binary xPack builds, I probably have some tens of libraries and tools, =
and most of them use separate build folders, no problem with this.

With these docker images I build, on the same 64-bit linux machine, =
multi-platform QEMU binaries (and other complicated things like =
toolchains), and for them I use separate build folders for each target =
platform (win32, win64, linux32, linux64) and a common source folder.

For my use case it isn't, automatic creation will break my folder =
structure and I'll not be able to use the common source folder and =
multiple target build folders structure that I use now.

I agree, if 'build' can be anywhere, not necessarily inside the source =
tree.

I just tested, and meson creates the build folder where it is instructed =
to, it can be inside or outside the source folder, so I think that the =
QEMU build procedure should preserve his freedom, and not enforced the =
use of a specific folder, otherwise performing multi-platform builds =
will be more complicated than necessary.
