I was thinking more of letting the simulation decide when to signal the
second eventfd in each pair, but now I understand you are trying to make
everything synchronous and ioeventfd is async by definition.

What are the semantics of returning from the calendar?  Does it mean
"it's now your turn to run?", "your entry has been added and you'll be
notified later when it's time to run?", or something else?

>      <-[return]--

What are the semantics of returning to the CPU?  Does it mean the
submitted I/O request is now complete?

Sorry for these questions.  If this becomes tedious for you I will look
into the paper you linked.
