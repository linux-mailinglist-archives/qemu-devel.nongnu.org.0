Maybe look for DEFINE_PROP_ to find out, For example:

qemu/target/arm/cpu.c:2757:
static Property arm_cpu_properties[] = {
     DEFINE_PROP_BOOL("start-powered-off", ARMCPU, start_powered_off, false),
     DEFINE_PROP_UINT32("psci-conduit", ARMCPU, psci_conduit, 0),
     DEFINE_PROP_UINT32("midr", ARMCPU, midr, 0),
     DEFINE_PROP_UINT64("mp-affinity", ARMCPU,
                         mp_affinity, ARM64_AFFINITY_INVALID),
     DEFINE_PROP_INT32("node-id", ARMCPU, node_id, CPU_UNSET_NUMA_NODE_ID),
     DEFINE_PROP_INT32("core-count", ARMCPU, core_count, -1),
     DEFINE_PROP_END_OF_LIST()
};

then qemu/hw/arm/bcm2836.c:138:
         /* start powered off if not enabled */
         object_property_set_bool(OBJECT(&s->cpu[n].core), n >= s->enabled_cpus,
                                  "start-powered-off", &err);


There's probably also a way to query and set these from monitor, info 
qtree command lists properties of instantiated devices I think. There's 
also some device_add option to get info on other devices but I don't know 
how that works. Maybe help device_add in monitor tells you.

Same as above, but look for property definition in device model under 
qemu/hw.

You need to find the appropriate device model or write it if does not 
exist then set it up in the board code to appear at the right addresses 
(or attach to right bus e.g. for i2c devices). The info mtree monitor 
command is useful to see what's mapped where and you can compare it to 
memory map of real hardware. For writing device models look at exising 
similar examples. Also enabling #define DEBUG_UNASSIGNED in qemu/memory.c 
is useful to get logs about guest attempting to access missing devices 
(although logged address can be relative to a memory region so may not be 
actual memory address in some cases). There's also a placeholder 
unimplemented device model that you can map over known unimplemented 
areas before you actually implement them, see for example 
hw/arm/xlnx-versal.c for how it's used.

This works, for telnet I'm afraid that's the simplest way. There's 
-monitor stdio or -serial stdio that can be useful.

>    7.  Ditto above comment for the -d option.

I think there's -D logfile to specify log file, these are somewhat 
documented in --help.
