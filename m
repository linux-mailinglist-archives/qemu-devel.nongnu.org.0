That's already not working today unless you add extra args to disable
build of the system emulators and tools.=20

Yeah it is very frustrating that it isn't actually useful in the way
you'd expect.

nettle isn't useful from POV of RNG.

With this v7, if building dynamically we get some parts of QEMU using
the full crypto/ impl and thus GNUTLS for RNG, and some parts of QEMU
using just the rng-platform.o.  I'd like it all to use the full crypto
impl when building dynamically.

Similarly if building statically, it should again result in the same
fallback choices. If a static gnutls is available it should use that,
but if none is present everything, it will get build with rng-platform.o

IOW, either we just document need to pass

   --disable-gnutls --disable-gcrypt --disable-nettle

if the distro lacks static versions of those libs - we already need
thus documented as we already suffer from that problem when building
statically.

Or we need to make configure more clever and check if static linking
actually works for these libs.
