I think I can guess how this could work for reporting features (I
haven't checked my guess against the code), which is what the
query-cpu-model-* do: suppress individual features when their group is
complete.

But "'-cpu' setup" doesn't seem to be about reporting features.  Am I
confused?

While testing, I noticed that

    $ s390x-softmmu/qemu-system-s390x

flashes a window at me, then terminates successfully, without printing
anything.  With -S, it behaves like other targets.  Bug?
