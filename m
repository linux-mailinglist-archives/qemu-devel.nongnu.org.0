OK understood. However this is specifically about PPC emulation where som=
e=20
bits exists in FPSCR that's hard to emulate with hardfloat but until=20
recently these weren't correctly emulated in my understanding and things=20
still ran OK so it's believed that these bits are seldom used. It was onl=
y=20
fixed due to some tests revealing it not because of actual negative=20
effects seen.

Unfortunately enabling hardfloat without any other changes would make the=
=20
default softfloat case a bit slower so that's why I was asking about also=
=20
making hardfloat case the default.

I can try to try some other approach to avoid always setting inexact bit=20
and only keep it set as other archs do but not sure when will I have time=
=20
to get there. Some help in this would be appreciated by those who know PP=
C=20
FPU and interested in running it faster in QEMU.
