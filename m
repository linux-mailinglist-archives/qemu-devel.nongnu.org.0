This has just recently been proposed:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-01/msg03617.html

I'm also working on a patch that I will post soon that extends the NBD 
protocol to advertise this information (it will help the situation where 
the destination is NBD, but as that requires a new enough server to 
advertise the information, having the feature as a command-line option 
allows the same speedup even without the server supporting the extension).

Multi-conn for reading the source allows better parallelism.  Multi-conn 
for writing is a bit trickier - it should be safe if the different 
connections are only touching distinct segments of the export (no 
overlaps), but as qemu does not advertise multiconn in such situations, 
you may still need a command-line switch to force multiple writers in 
spite of the server not advertising it.  Here, I'm not aware of anyone 
with patches underway, but I also think it would be a good ground for 
exploring.

Would be nice, but I'm not aware of anyone currently planning to add it.

How are you intending to use this? I'm guessing you have some way of 
feeding in information to qemu-img of which portions of the source image 
you want to copy, and ignore remaining portions.

Note that it IS already possible to use qemu's copy-on-read feature as a 
way to copy only a subset of a source file over to a destination file. 
When demonstrating incremental backup, I wrote this shell function:

copyif() {
if test $# -lt 2 || test $# -gt 3; then
   echo 'usage: copyif src dst [bitmap]'
   return 1
fi
if test -z "$3"; then
   map_from="-f raw nbd://localhost:10809/$1"
   state=true
else
   map_from="--image-opts driver=nbd,export=$1,server.type=inet"
   map_from+=",server.host=localhost,server.port=10809"
   map_from+=",x-dirty-bitmap=qemu:dirty-bitmap:$3"
   state=false
fi
$qemu_img info -f raw nbd://localhost:10809/$1 || return
$qemu_img info -f qcow2 $2 || return
ret=0
$qemu_img rebase -u -f qcow2 -F raw -b nbd://localhost:10809/$1 $2
while read line; do
   [[ $line =~ .*start.:.([0-9]*).*length.:.([0-9]*).*data.:.$state.* ]] 
|| continue
   start=${BASH_REMATCH[1]} len=${BASH_REMATCH[2]}
   echo
   echo " $start $len:"
   qemu-io -C -c "r $start $len" -f qcow2 $2
done < <($qemu_img map --output=json $map_from)
$qemu_img rebase -u -f qcow2 -b '' $2
if test $ret = 0; then echo 'Success!'; fi
return $ret
}

The key lines here are 'qemu-io -C -c "r $start $len" -f qcow2 $2', 
which is performed in a loop to read just targetted portions of the 
destination qcow2 file with copy-on-read set to pull in that portion 
from its backing file, and '<($qemu_img map --output=json $map_from)' 
which was used to derive the extent map driving which portions of the 
file to read.

We also have 'qemu-img dd' that can copy subsets of a file, although it 
is not currently the ideal interface, and probably needs to be enhanced 
(I have a branch where I had tried working on patches for it, but where 
the feedback was that we want the improvements to be more generic, or 
even teach 'qemu-img convert' to support offsets the way 'qemu-img dd' 
tries to; I'd need to revisit that branch...)

Although you could still couple things together: nbdcp for new features 
plus qemu-nbd to drive an NBD wrapper around qcow2 (as source or as 
destination).

I could see all of these being viable additions to qemu-img, but also 
wonder if writing nbdcp would get those features available in a faster 
manner.

These make sense for any qemu-img format.

These might make more sense as tunables for how to set up NBD client 
(destination) or server (source), rather than directly as qemu-img 
options.  That is, I could imagine that we'd use qemu-img 
--image-format, and then expose new blockdev-style knobs for setting up 
the NBD endpoint to enable multiconn usage of that endpoint.

>                'nbd://...'|DISK.IMG 'nbd://...'|DISK.IMG

And these options also seem like they are useful to qemu-img proper.

Again, depending on how we want to mix-and-match things, using qemu-nbd 
to create the NBD endpoint for the nbdcp source or destination may be 
worthwhile (which is different than directly using qemu-img); we'd want 
some decent examples of building such chains between tools.  Or it could 
help us decide whether we can cut out some overhead by consolidating 
typical uses into one tool rather than requiring convoluted chains.

Could we also teach this to parse 'qemu-img map --output=json' format? 
And/or add 'qemu-img map --output=XYZ' (different from the current 
--output=human') that gives sufficient information?  (Note: 
--output=human is NOT suitable for extent lists - it intentionally 
outputs only the data portions, and in so doing coalesces 'hole' and 
'hole,zero' segments to be indistinguishable).

Supporting optional arguments to long options is okay, but supporting 
optional arguments to short options gets tricky when using getopt.  I 
would recommend two separate options, '-p' with no argument as shorthand 
for progress to stderr, and '-P description' with mandatory option for 
where to send progress, rather than trying to let '-p' have optional 
argument.
