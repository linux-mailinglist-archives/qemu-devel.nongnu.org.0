Since both the generic PCI IDE and CMD646 Linux drivers mention irq is 
cleared on reading status I think using ide_ioport_read in hw/ide/pci.c 
may be correct for the generic case. Not sure if the CMD646 has some 
pecularity but maybe the difference in drivers is to avoid bugs not 
because of CMD646 not clearing irq. The wikipedia page of CMD640:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMD640

mentions some versions of it has a bug similar to RZ-1000 for which 
there's a doc referenced that says the problem is that it forgets last 
data word after raising (or clearing?) IRQ and a workaround is to avoid 
checking status until all data transferred. This may explain why Linux 
checks alt status and clears interrupt instead of reading status register.

I don't know but sounds plausible that reading the status reg clears irq 
but reading the pci config words that mirrors it won't clear it. But the 
traces you had show that ide_ioport_read was called so driver was likely 
reading status and not the config regs?

I've found some further logs:

https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-270357.html
https://www.redhat.com/archives/axp-list/2000-October/msg00070.html
https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_beginner_books/debian_linux_desktop_survival_guide/Docking_Station.shtml

These show Linux messages for early CMD646 revisions that had bugs but 
what I've noticed is that they say something about not 100% native mode 
which seems to be similar to what I had with via-ide when it uses IRQ14-15 
even in native mode. Could your problem be similar? Maybe you could search 
for more such logs for Linux booting on Sun Ultra machines and see what 
those say and check how it determines which IRQ number it should use. This 
may depend on some setting that's not emulated correctly.

I think this may be to avoid bug with CMD646U.

I'm not sure either but from what I've seen so far I think CMD646 either 
refers to the whole family (i.e. all versions) or early versions depending 
on context while there are at least two more newer versions referred to as 
CMD646U and CMD646U2 but probably there are more revisions within these as 
U2 seems to be rev5. QEMU sets the revision field to 7 but I'm not sure 
that's the same Linux checks for. There's some more info on this here:
