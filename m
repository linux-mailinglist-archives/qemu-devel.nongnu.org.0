Hi Darren,
If I move the definition of SEPARATOR to Patch 9, I would need some
different way to parse commands here, to keep everything bisectable. I
don't think the separator is only important in the context of the
Crossover functionality (Patch 9) - it is useful in general as a
"stable" way to parse an input into multiple commands.
Is it OK if I keep SEPARATOR in this patch and add the comments you
mention to both this patch and patch 9?
Thanks
-Alex
