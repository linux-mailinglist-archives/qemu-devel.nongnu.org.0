Would this actually make the implementation simpler, though?

I mean, the original idea was anyway that we'd just add new fields to
the header instead of using header extensions. Header extensions were
only meant for dynamically sized things like strings. That we would add
new fields to the header is why the header_length field even exists.

So in this case, we could consider using bytes 104-107 of the header for
compression_type instead of adding a new header extension.
