Not really; it definitely works for all memories that we've touched.  My
previous exmaple wanted to let the guest app use a not-yet-allocated page.  I
figured mlockall() might achieve that, hence I proposed such an example
assuming that may verify the zero page issue on live snapshot.  So if my
understanding is correct, if we run above scenario, current live snapshot might
fail that app when we do the "check" command at last, by finding non-zero pages.
