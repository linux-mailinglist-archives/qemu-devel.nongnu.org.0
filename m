Traditionally, I think migration assumes that frontends (guest devices)
must match exactly, but backends may and usually will differ.

Of course, dirty bitmaps are a backend feature that isn't really related
to guest devices, so this doesn't really work out any more in your case.
BlockBackend names are unusable for this purpose (especially as we're
moving towards anonymous BlockBackends everywhere), which I guess
essentially means node-name is the only option left.

Is bitmap migration something that must be enabled explicitly or does
it happen automatically? If it's explicit, then making an additional
requirement (matching node-names) shouldn't be a problem.

blk_name has to be assumed to be "". The BdrvChild path changes when
filters are inserted (and inserting filters on the destination that
aren't present on the source, or vice versa, sounds like something that
should just work).

So both parts of this are not great ways for addressing nodes.

I'm afraid node-name is the only thing that could possibly work reliably
for identifying nodes.
