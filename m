This has both a positive and a negative effect: Now you don't have to
modify another file when you add a new test, but it will be picked up
automatically. However, if you want to disable a test, you could
previously just remove it from groups (or comment it out), and now you
have to delete the test instead.

Downstream, I think we still disable a few tests because we're compiling
out features that are required for some tests to pass, and deleting the
test cases completely would probably move conflicts just to a different
place.

So I think we need a method to distuingish an enabled test that is in no
group from a disabled test.

This one would also require us to be able to distinguish test case files
from arbitrary other files.

We lose these comments without a replacement. I wonder whether it's
important or if we can think of another way to make sure that numbers
aren't reused. (I'm not completely sure any more why we decided that we
don't want to reuse numbers. Maybe because of backports?)
