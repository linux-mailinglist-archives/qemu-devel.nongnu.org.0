I'm not sure what the exact definition of "end of life" of a distro is
that we're using. I seem to remember that the reason for using Python
3.5 was Debian Stretch. Its official end of life is in about three
weeks, but then there is still some LTS thing with reduced support done
by a different group.

If we read our policy literally and use the regular end of life, I guess
we could just move QEMU to 3.6 for everything.

It's kind of obvious that this can't require user interaction because we
want ./configure; make to work. So I guess this means the venv needs to
be set up automatically by configure/make?

Yes. And you'll have many dependencies on it, so it would be a separate
target anyway.

Sure. I'm not overly familiar with all of this, but I guess my point was
just that a venv is needed rather than a global installation into the
user directory. If nobody ever suggested the latter, blame the
misunderstanding on my non-existent experience with more complex Python
setups.
