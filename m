Ubuntu do actually put a sub-version number in here; if you
do 'lsb_release -a' on a properly upgraded 16.04 LTS system
it will tell you it's 16.04.6.

We do effectively assume that to some extent (ie I don't
think we need to support the very first 16.04 release), and
I think that's not unreasonable, because if you're not updating
then you have a huge pile of security vulnerabilities you haven't
patched against. The vastly common use case is to stay up to date
within an LTS type release.

We don't dictate to users how they should use or update their
OS. But we do have to define a policy which balances the
amount of effort we as upstream would have to do (limiting
the set of systems we support is less work for us), against
the benefit to users of having support for a wider range of
systems. The deprecation-policy is where we've set that balance.
It is inevitable that there will be some set of users that are
left unsupported by the point we've chosen. We hope that that
set of users is fairly small, because we include LTS distros
in our supported set and give a 2 year grace period for users
to move forward; and many users who for stability reasons want
to stick with an older distro will also be staying with the
older QEMU and not moving forward to the most recent one.
But, yes, there will be some who are stuck on the older LTS and
still want the newer QEMU. That's unfortunate for them, but
we can't support everybody on the planet on every version of
Linux ever shipped since the 1990s. Those users get to
make a choice between remaining with their stable environment
(the QEMU we shipped to them originally still works and won't
evaporate) or moving forward to both a newer QEMU and perhaps
a newer version of their host OS.
