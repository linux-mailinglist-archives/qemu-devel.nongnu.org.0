I agree. Currently, it's unsafe to do any hot(un)plug.
But I thought (and wanted to clarify) it would be nice to make it safe.
Hold the RCU around the entire migration is not the only way actually.
For example, we can defer RAMBlock deletion: refcount RAMBlocks before
migration and unref them after migration.

Hm... Yeah, that's a problem, thanks for mentioning it!

I see that hot(un)plug during migration has many issues.
But generally it has three groups (if I didn't miss something):
1) RAMBlock add/del
2) Device add/del
3) VMState add/del

IIUC, RAMBlocks are not always connected to some devices.
So, in theory, it might become possible to hot(un)plug a block
without hot adding/removing a device. It's why I wanted to clarify
is there a sense to fix separately the problems related to RAMBlocks.

But, if you think there is no sense to fix all related problems
to let hot(un)plugging during migration be allowed, I think we can add
an assert(!migrate_is_idle()) in qemu_ram_free.

1) Guest: writes to slot's pci config
2) QEMU: pcie_cap_slot_write_config -> pcie_unplug_device

So, it's only guest driven action and qdev_unplug doesn't help here.
