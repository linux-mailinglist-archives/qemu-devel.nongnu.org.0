I am not using anything related to migration, just launching with a
simple flat qcow2 file, no snapshots, backing stores or anything like
that.

The host is Archlinux x64 but I'm running inside of a docker container
that runs Ubuntu 18.04.

The command-line is:

qemu-system-i386 -spice port=3D5800,disable-ticketing=3Don -cpu pentium -m
128 -vga std -no-kvm -hda Win95C.qcow2 -nodefaults -no-hpet -no-acpi
-cdrom Win95C.iso -nodefaults -M isapc -monitor stdio

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
