I like the grouping - you can then do a 4-byte read and comparison to 0 
to see if the entire cluster reads as zeroes or is unallocated.

With 32k clusters, this results in 1k subclusters.  In cluster 1 (offset 
32k), which bits map where?  (The obvious choices are that sub-cluster 
32k maps to bit 0, 33k maps to bit 1, ...; or that sub-cluster 32k maps 
to bit 31, 33k maps to bit 30, ...)

/me reads ahead

okay, in patch 5, you said you map the most significant bit to the first 
cluster. That feels backwards to me; I wonder if the math is any easier 
if you map sub-clusters starting from the least-significant, because 
then you get:

bit = (address >> cluster_size) & 32

rather than

bit = 31 - ((address >> cluster_size) & 32)

Again reading ahead, I see that patch 5 requires a 16k minimum cluster 
for using extended L2.  Could we still permit clusters smaller than 
that, but merely document that subclusters are always a minimum of 512 
bytes and therefore for an 8k cluster we only use 16 bits (leaving the 
other 16 bits zero)?  But I'm also fine with the simplicity of just 
stating that subclusters require at least 16k clusters.

I think you've got more flexibility with the two bits per sub-cluster 
than you would with just 1 bit and 64 subclusters, so I don't think this 
direction is going to get us far.

Agreed.

Looks promising!

How do subclusters interact with external data files?
