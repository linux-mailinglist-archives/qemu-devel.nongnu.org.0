The distinction between short life and long life Linux distributions
turned out to be redundant. They can both be covered in a simple way
by noting support will target the current release, and the previous
release for a period of two years or until its EOL. This rule can also
apply to the other UNIX based distros, leaving only Windows needing a
different set of rules.

This also clarifies that Debian LTS is out of scope, because the LTS
support is provided by a separate group from the main Debian maintainer
team.

+-----------------------------------------
 
-For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases, the project
-will aim to support all versions that are not end of life by their

-versions, the project will look at Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE distros.
-Other short- lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar software
-versions.
+The project aims to support the most recent major version at all times. Support
+for the previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new major
+version is released or when the vendor itself drops support, whichever comes
+first. In this context, third-party efforts to extend the lifetime of a distro
+are not considered, even when they are endorsed by the vendor (eg. Debian LTS).

-The project supports building with current versions of the MinGW
-toolchain, hosted on Linux.
+For FreeBSD and OpenBSD, decisions will be made based on the contents of the

-macOS
------
+For macOS, `HomeBrew`_ will be used, although `MacPorts`_ is expected to carry
+similar versions.
