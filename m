true, but it's user policy which is defined by user not by QEMU.

user doesn't have to be a human, it could be some mgmt layer that would
automate retry logic, depending on what actually user needs for particular task
(i.e. fail immediately, retry N time then fail, retry with time out - then fail,
don't care - succeed, ...). The point is for QEMU to provide means for mgmt to
implement whatever policy user would need.

PS:
but then, I know close to nothing about PCI, so all of above might be nonsense.
