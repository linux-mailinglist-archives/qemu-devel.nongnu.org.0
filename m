It is the same pattern.  However, one of the two synchronized variables
is a counter rather than just a flag.

Got it.

I'd also prefer the one with just fences, because we only really control
one side of the synchronization primitive (ctx_notify_me in my litmus
test) and I don't like the idea of forcing seq-cst MO on the other side
(bh_scheduled).  The performance issue that I mentioned is that x86
doesn't have relaxed fetch and add, so you'd have a redundant fence like
this:

	lock	xaddl $2, mem1
	mfence
	...
	movl	mem1, %r8

(Gory QEMU details however allow us to use relaxed load and store here,
because there's only one writer).

This helps a lot already; I'll work on a documentation and code patch.
Thanks very much.
