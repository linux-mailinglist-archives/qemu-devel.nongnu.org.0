+1

Also, I believe it's more modern nowadays to express the same example
with "blockdev" syntax, rather than "drive". (Not that I could suggest
the exact spelling for that :)) I don't expect the modern syntax to
behave differently, I just guess it's better to stick with the new in
examples / commit messages etc.

Great questions!

Thanks!
