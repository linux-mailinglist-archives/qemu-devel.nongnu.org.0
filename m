It does still crash on current QEMU. The proximate cause of the crash is
that you are trying to read from an address which is way outside RAM:

where the insn at 0x400195d8 is (inside strcmp)
0x400195d8:  f8408402  ldr      x2, [x0], #8

You can see that x0 is is 000000104010ca28, so QEMU is correct to give
the data abort here. Further diagnosis would require working back
through the log to find out where that address came from, which will be
easier for you to do since you have the source.

NB: I recommend these options for producing the logfile:
 /tmp/q.log -d in_asm,int,cpu_reset,exec,cpu,guest_errors,nochain -singlest=
ep
Execution will be slower, but the crash here is pretty quick so that's not =
a problem, and these options mean that every insn executed will produce a "=
Trace" line and a CPU register dump. That's easier to understand and read (=
especially reading backwards) than logs produced when QEMU is doing its nor=
mal optimisations of chaining TBs together and putting multiple guest insns=
 in each TB.

Title:
  Spurious Data Abort on qemu-system-aarch64

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When running RTEMS test psxndbm01.exe built for AArch64-ilp32 (this code =
is not yet publically available), the test generates a spurious data abort =
(the MMU and alignment checks should be disabled according to bits 1, 0 of =
SCTLR_EL1). The abort information is as follows:
  Taking exception 4 [Data Abort]
  ...from EL1 to EL1
  ...with ESR 0x25/0x96000010
  ...with FAR 0x104010ca28
  ...with ELR 0x400195d8
  ...to EL1 PC 0x40018200 PSTATE 0x3c5

  The ESR indicates that a synchronous external abort has occurred.
  ESR EC field: 0b100101

  From the ARMv8 technical manual: Data Abort taken without a change in
  Exception level. Used for MMU faults generated by data accesses,
  alignment faults other than those caused by Stack Pointer
  misalignment, and synchronous External aborts, including synchronous
  parity or ECC errors. Not used for debug related exceptions.

  ESR ISS field: 0b10000

  From the ARMv8 technical manual: Synchronous External abort, not on
  translation table walk or hardware update of translation table.

  The following command line is used to invoke qemu:
  qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt -cpu cortex-a53 -m 256M -no-reboot -nog=
raphic -serial mon:stdio -kernel build/aarch64/a53_ilp32_qemu/testsuites/ps=
xtests/psxndbm01.exe -D qemu.log -d in_asm,int,cpu_reset,unimp,guest_errors

  This occurs on Qemu 3.1.0 as distributed via Debian and on Qemu 4.1 as
  built by the RTEMS source builder (4.1+minor patches).

  Edit: This bug can be worked around by getting and setting SCTLR
  without changing its value before each data abort would occur. This
  test needs 6 of these workarounds to operate successfully.
