In
https://virtualization.linux-foundation.narkive.com/q6XOkO76/rfc-0-3-virtio-iommu-a-paravirtualized-iommu

I found

"
(Note: the semantics of unmap are chosen to be compatible with VFIO's
type1 v2 IOMMU API. This way a device serving as intermediary between
guest and VFIO doesn't have to keep an internal tree of mappings. They are
a bit tighter than VFIO, in that they don't allow unmap spilling outside
mapped regions. Spilling is 'undefined' at the moment, because it should
work in most cases but I don't know if it's worth the added complexity in
devices that are not simply transmitting requests to VFIO. Splitting
mappings won't ever be allowed, but see the relaxed proposal in 3/3 for
more lenient semantics)
