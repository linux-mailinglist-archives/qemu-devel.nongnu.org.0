In the course of trying to do some conversions of devices to
the new API I've proposed, I figured out the other part of what
this "to avoid reentrancy issues" probably is referring to:
if the device's 'triggered' callback itself calls a ptimer
function like ptimer_run() then potentially it could recurse:
 ptimer_trigger() -> trigger callback -> ptimer_run() ->
  ptimer_reload() -> ptimer_trigger() -> ...

I need to think a bit more carefully about what is supposed
to happen here and what we want to have happen. I guess at
the moment we'll just schedule the QEMU BH to run again,
so the trigger callback is called again, but not recursively.
So we should probably cause that to happen in the new scheme
(conceptually, something like "the trigger callback is
implicitly considered to be called from within a tx begin/
commit block, so (a) it doesn't need to do begin/commit itself
and (b) if it does something resulting in a repeat trigger
the second call will happen after it returns, not recursively" ?)
