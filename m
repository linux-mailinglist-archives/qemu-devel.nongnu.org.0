But I don=E2=80=99t know whether that explanation is actually correct.  I m=
ean,
that would apply for enabled active bitmaps just as well.  But we do
allow resizing an image with such bitmaps so it seems clear that we have
some idea on what to do.  (Or at least we pretend we do, for better or
worse).

(Which is that bdrv_dirty_bitmap_truncate() just calls
hbitmap_truncate(), which fills the new space with zeroes.)

The real reason we can=E2=80=99t resize with certain kinds of bitmaps prese=
nt
seems more like:
(1) There are some bitmaps that can=E2=80=99t be written to, but we=E2=80=
=99d have to if
we wanted to resize the image and they=E2=80=99re persistent,
(2) The second case are bitmaps that are persistent but present in
memory; we just haven=E2=80=99t implemented that case, I presume.

So it seems less like a case of =E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t know what to do=
=E2=80=9D, but more a
combination of =E2=80=9CWe can=E2=80=99t=E2=80=9C and =E2=80=9CWe haven=E2=
=80=98t implemented this case, but
it=E2=80=99s clear what to do if we did=E2=80=9D.

Yeah.  I don=E2=80=99t think anyone even would have realistic use for
transactional amends.  I suppose all users can easily split their amend
calls with multiple options into multiple amends in the order that would
be most likely reversible, if something went wrong along the way.  (And
that also works.  I.e., downgrading/upgrading is probably the most easy
to revert, but maybe you can only downgrade if your image has the
correct size, so you potentially need to truncate it first.  OTOH, I
can=E2=80=99t imagine many people actually use qemu-img amend to downgrade =
qcow2
images anyway...)

I agree, but to me that seems to suggest that it might not be ideal to
consider the amend interface a =E2=80=9CThis is a description of the post-a=
mend
state I want=E2=80=9D interface, because implementing that correctly seems =
to be
very complicated.  The alternative would be =E2=80=9CThis is a description =
of
what I want to change=E2=80=9D, and you can give multiple things at once, b=
ut
there is no guarantee of whether that works or not.

I feel very much reminded of the LUKS keyslot discussion...

(That is to say, my thoughts on this have little to do with this
specific patch at this point.)
