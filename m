Thanks.

Would this unavailable-features property contain only canonical names of
the features or all possible aliases of all features? For example,
"tsc-adjust" can also be spelled as "tsc_adjust". When calling
query-cpu-model-expansion, we have a way to request all variants by
running full expansion on the result of a previous static expansion. Can
we get something like this for unavailable-features too?

As you mentioned, there are two interesting QOM properties:
filtered-features and feature-words and both are used by libvirt. We use
feature-words to get CPU features which were enabled in the guest CPU on
top of what we expected. This is the case of, e.g., a feature added to a
given CPU model for new machine types. I guess we could switch to
checking QOM properties for individual features as a replacement for
feature-words which covers both CPUID and MSR features.
