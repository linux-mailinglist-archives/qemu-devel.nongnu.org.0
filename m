Slirp is a different scenario. That was functionality that was historically
integrated into QEMU and was then spun out into a standalone project. Since
we had existing users on existing distro releases dependant on Slirp, we wanted
to give a smooth upgrade experiance by bundling Slirp. Essentially the goal was
to avoid the regression if someone deployed new QEMU on existing distros.

Meson is a fairly similar scenario. We wanted to swap the build system in
QEMU over to Meson, and that change would affect all existing users of QEMU.
Many distros didn't have a new enough meson, and so bundling it in QEMU enables
us to give a smooth upgrade path without any regression for existing users
on existing distros.

This patch, however, is proposing an entirely new piece of functionality
that has no existing users and even once present will be used by relatively
few users compartively speaking. As such there is no upgrade compatibility /
regression scenario that we need to worry about. Anyone interested in the
new functionality can be reasonably asked to either wait for the distro to
package it, or build it themselves. 

With regards,
Daniel
