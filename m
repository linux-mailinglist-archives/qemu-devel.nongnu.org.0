OK, I expected users to come in a separate patch.

But that was my point on IRC.  Is it really more useful if
bdrv_make_zero() is just as quick?  (And the fact that NBD doesn=E2=80=99t =
have
an implementation looks more like a problem with NBD to me.)

(Considering that at least the code we discussed on IRC didn=E2=80=99t work=
 for
preallocated images, which was the one point where we actually have a
problem in practice.)

How is it a shame?  I think only management tools would use convert -n.
 Management tools want reliable behavior.  If you want reliable
behavior, you have to use --target-is-zero anyway.  So I don=E2=80=99t see =
the
actual benefit for qemu-img convert.

The thing is, I don=E2=80=99t see the user effort.  I don=E2=80=99t think u=
sers use
convert -n or backup manually.  And for management tools, it isn=E2=80=99t
really effort to add another switch.

But the user can=E2=80=99t know when qemu isn=E2=80=99t smart enough.  So u=
sers who care
have to always give the flag.

I=E2=80=99m sure it is, but the question I ask is whether in practice we
wouldn=E2=80=99t get --target-is-zero in all of these cases anyway.


So I=E2=80=99m not sold on =E2=80=9Cit works most of the time=E2=80=9D, bec=
ause if it=E2=80=99s just
most of the time, then we=E2=80=99ll likely see --target-is-zero all of the=
 time.

OTOH, I suppose that with the new qcow2 extension, it would always work
for the following case:
(1) Create a qcow2 file,
(2) Immediately (with the next qemu-img/QMP invocation) use it as a
target of convert -n or mirror or anything similar.

If so, that means it works reliably all of the time for a common case.
I guess that=E2=80=99d be enough for me.
