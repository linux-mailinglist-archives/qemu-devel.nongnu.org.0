It's documented here:

https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/wiki/SubprojectPegasos2#h2-Current.20status.20and.20outstanding.20issues

but pegasos2 is not in QEMU master yet, I'm just trying to clean it up and 
submit it so testing likely comes after I have a set of patches to send to 
add pegasos2. The version in qmiga repo is not the latest but one that 
works in itself, my current vt82c686c work is to upstream the vt8231 part. 
After that the rest should be simple: add mv64361 model and pegasos2 board 
code. The only problem I see with those is if it's OK to have board 
needing ROM image or if Mark torpedoes it for some reason :-). For the ROM 
I have plans to use vof (virtual open firmware emulation within QEMU, 
unmerged on qemu-ppc list currently for a while) but I couldn't get to 
that yet. Maybe Linux can be used via -kernel but I think it also needs 
Open Firmware client interface on pegasos2 so it won't work without some 
kind of firmware. (All this is also documented on above page if you scroll 
up.)

(By the way I've created the qmiga.osdn.net project with the intent to 
share work with interested people on these but so far nobody seemed to be 
interested enough to join and help. There were about 2 or 3 people 
interested in ati-vga but got scared away when saw how much work is needed 
yet. Contributions are still welcome otherwise it will take another few 
years to finish.)
