I think my concerns were really only about error_abort and "normal"
non-NULL errp losing some information about the origin of the error. And
from this thread, it seems that I misremebered and the normal one is
actually supposed to just work.

In any case, wrapping NULL and error_fatal should be fine, so I agree
that a single macro should do.

Hm, I think it's more obviously correct if done at the top, but I also
can't see any reason why using it only in a block wouldn't work. So I'd
put it at the top just as a matter of style.

> Kevin, is something bad in propagation, when it not related to error_abort?

Probably not, unless I didn't misremember, but we misread the code.
