Correct - we only use hardfloat when we know it will give the same
result which is broadly when the inexact flag is already set and we are
dealing with normal floating point numbers.

We added a whole bunch of testing to ensure we maintain accuracy when
the code went in.

About the only comparison I can think of is the thread=3Dsingle:multi
flags for TCG which is mostly there to help developers eliminate causes
of bugs. The default for MTTCG is it is enabled when it's safe. If you
enable it via the command line where QEMU hasn't defaulted it on you
will get lots of loud warnings about potential instability. The most
commonly used case is thread=3Dsingle when you want to check it's not a
MTTCG bug.

I'm as cautious as Peter here about adding a "faster but broken" command
line flag because users will invariably read up to the "faster" and then
spend a lot of time scratching their heads when things break.
