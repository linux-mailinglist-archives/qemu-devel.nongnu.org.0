Stating requirements is much appreciated.  Design rationale would be
even better :)

As pointed out many times, shared memory is not a solution to any
communication problem, it's merely a building block for building such
solutions: you invariably have to layer some protocol on top.  In your
KVM Forum talk, you mention layering virtio on top.  Makes sense to me.
But why does *this* virtio transport have to be an independent device?
Other transports aren't.

Now let me indulge in spec nitpicking :)

Isn't "same memory content" redundant with "shared memory"?

Are these the "unidirectional sections" mentioned previously?

Use case for legacy INTx?

For what it's worth, we removed INTx support from ivshmem v1 in rev 1,
QEMU 2.6.

Same as ivshmem v1.  Revision ID (offset 08h) disambiguates.

ivshmem v1 is rev 0 before QEMU 2.6, rev 1 since.  Rev 1 is
backward-compatible to rev 0 for guest software.  Is rev 2 intended to
be backward-compatible, too?

You should probably explan how your v2 relates to v1 in more detail,
possibly in its own top-level section.

FFh means "device does not fit any defined class."  For what it's worth,
ivshmem v1 uses 05h "Memory Controller", with sub-class and interface
00h "RAM Controller".

ivshmem v1 leaves these blank.

"If MSI-X is available"?

A PCIe device always provides MSI-X, and may additionally provide legacy
INTx.  A conventional PCI device may provide either or both.  In any
case, the Interrupt Pin register is zero when legacy INTx is not
provided,

Is this an example of where the device does not conform to the PCI Local

Length is 20h when Base Adress is present, else 18h.  Worth spelling

Well, the other bits of that register are writable, they're just
ignored.

For what it's worth, existing ivshmem-spec.txt uses the terms read-only,
write-only, read/write and reserved bits rigorously: "Software should
only access the registers as specified [...]  Reserved bits should be
ignored on read, and preserved on write."

Rationale for not wanting to support relocatable shared memory?

This vendor-specific capability must always be present, I presume.

I'm confused.  Does that mean the device shall support either MSI-X or
legacy INTx, but never both?

I guess this means a polling mode of operation is not possible.

"can be mapped as a single page" depends on the host system, not the
device.

For what it's worth, ivshmem v1 fixes the size of BAR0 to 256 bytes.
Any particular reason to keep its size so loosely specified in v2?

Definitely not backwards compatible to rev 1.  I figure that means v2
should use a different Vendor ID / Device ID, not just bump the Revsion
ID.

No interrupt status register?

I presume this applies only to legacy INTx.  Correct?

ivshmem v1 calls this Interrupt Mask.

That's because all peers use the same number of vectors.  Worth spelling ou=

"the remote device"?  Do you mean all peers?

"interrupt vector 0" assumes MSI-X.  With legacy INTx, it simply
triggers an interrupt.

How can guest software distinguish between "interrupt due to remote
state change" and "interrupt due to doorbell"?

Things become so much easier when you ditch INTx: reserve vector 0 for
state change, done.

I guess the meaning of state values depends on the protocol type.
Correct?

Are you sure this use of PCI class code is kosher?

Final request: please break your lines around column 70 for readability.
