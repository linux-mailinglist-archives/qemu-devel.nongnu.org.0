>=20

	The reason we have message IDs is so the client knows which =
request
is being acknowledged if it has more than one non-ack'd request =
outstanding.
Requests are executed in-order; the only time parallelism can happen is =
if
multiple client threads send requests in parallel.  A single thread can
pipeline requests, but those requests are not executed out of order by =
the
server.

	I=E2=80=99ll try to re-word it to be clearer.

	I=E2=80=99m not sure we=E2=80=99ll be able to improve on device =
reset, since
the client does not know what operations were completed before the
server died, and some region reads and writes may not be idempotent. =20

	I=E2=80=99d like to give Thanos a chance to reply before we =

a change.

	I=E2=80=99d like to re-think the versioning a bit to avoid some =
of
the indeterminism.  I think it might be better to have the fields that
must exist to bootstrap the protocol (major & minor) be enumerated in
the version packet body.  Then, for each major/minor we can specify the
objects and their types that may exist in the JSON array.

	This list would initially only have the =E2=80=9Ctype=E2=80=9D =
string.
