FWIW, I'd probably stop at Ethernet class devices, vfio doesn't really
expose whether a device is a VF, so we'd likely need to resort to
getting that info through sysfs.  It also seems like there might be
some limited-use cases of copying the MAC from a PF to the virtio nic
or use of utilities on the host for modifiying a PF MAC, perhaps via
eeprom.  So while we expect the typical use case to be a VF, it's
probably ugly and unnecessarily restrictive to enforce it.  Thanks,

Alex
