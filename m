OK. I'm mostly concerned about modeling the chips I know about for
now. If a chip with four AXI endpoints and four chipselects on SPI0
appears, it will be a fairly small change to move these arrays into
the SoC class struct, but I'd rather not do that without evidence that
such a chip exist.

The IP blocks may be identical for all I know, but they are not wired
up identically, and that's really what matters here in the SoC-level
model.

I mean I don't like how the semantics of ssi_transfer changes
implicitly in the middle of the transfer. One call shifts a whole
byte, the next 8 shift individual bits, then it's back to bytes again.
If a mistake is made, the flash controller might end up thinking it's
shifting 16 bits, but if the flash device only expects 8 dummy bits,
it will see 8 bits + 8 bytes for a total of 9 bytes of dummies. This
differs a lot from what would happen on a real device.

For example, I wrote up a test for the aspeed flash controller against
a Winbond flash chip in Dual I/O mode. The data ended up getting
shifted by 15 bytes because of, I think, bugs in the dummy logic on
both sides. I took a lot of head scratching to figure out what's going
on.

Here's where aspeed_smc figures it needs to send 2 dummy bytes (aka 16
dummy bits) for a DIO read:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/latest/source/hw/ssi/aspeed_smc.c#L803

And here's where the Winbond model decides to expect one dummy _bit_:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/qemu/latest/source/hw/block/m25p80.c#L862

The difference is 15 ssi_transfers, which is what I see in the test.

IMO they're both wrong -- they should both expect one dummy byte, or
four dummy cycles in x2 mode. But the real problem, also IMO, is that
they can't even agree on whether one ssi_transfer means one bit or one
byte.

While ssi_shift_dummy_bits is strictly nicer than open-coded loops of
ssi_transfer, it doesn't fix the underlying problem that the dummy
cycles need to be treated specially by both the flash controller model
and the device model, and if they're not 100% synchronized (which is
particularly interesting when you have flash chips with configurable
dummy cycles), the result is like nothing you'd ever see on a real
system.

Hmm, I see what you mean. It can do 16-byte bursts. I'm not sure if
that looks more like a single 16-byte access or four 4-byte accesses
on the SPI bus. I was assuming it's the former, but I could be wrong.
