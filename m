I will come back to you once I've figured that patch-set out.

I don't know. Janosch could answer that, but he is on vacation. Adding
Claudio maybe he can answer. My understanding is, that while it might be
possible, it is ugly at best. The ability to do a transition is
indicated by a CPU model feature. Indicating the feature to the guest and
then failing the transition sounds wrong to me.

I'm with you. I hoped to get changing features on the fly approved first
before setting out to solve this. But I will look into it.
