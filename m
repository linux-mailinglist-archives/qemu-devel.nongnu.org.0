That is what I am doing now but have not completed yet. Actually, when 
we insert the COR-filter for a stream job, the cases with concurrent 
jobs fail in the iotests:030. I am trying to cope with the issues and 
still in progress. The problem I am forseeing is that if a user 
specifies the filter node as a base for a job, the name of the filter 
will be written down to the QCOW2 header on the disk. It can happen if 
bdrv_refresh_filename() returns the json-name of the filter. Max 
separated the backing file of QCOW2 header from the one, let's say, in 
the running program with this series. Imagine, If the user doesn't 
specify the backing file in a QAPI command, the program will use the 
name of the filter read from the QCOW2 header. Let me please finish the 
experiment and I will back to you with results or issues...
