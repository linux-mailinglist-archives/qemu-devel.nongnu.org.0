Good point.  I'll respin this series where v2 never writes the implicit 
format except for a raw image (because probing raw is not only safe to 
record, but also prevents the guest from ever changing that probe, and 
the real risk we are interested in preventing is when a formerly raw 
image later probes as non-raw).

Making it mandatory will require the completion of the deprecation 
period.  For 5.0 and 5.1, the best we can do is the warning, but for 5.2 
(assuming v2 of this series is acceptable), it WILL become a hard error.

Hmm.  json:{"driver":"qcow2",...} encodes the format, but your argument 
is that json:{"driver":"file",...} encodes only the protocol but not the 
format.  We want the warning when there is no format, but with json:, it 
becomes harder to tell if a format is present or not.  I'll have to 
think about what to do in that case.

Point taken. v2 will address this differently.
