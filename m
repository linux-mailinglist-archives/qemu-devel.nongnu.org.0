Hi Cosmin,

The thread that you are pointing to is Stefan's initial work on this
subject, but it is not the last update. Since 2018, a lot of things have
happened. I have personally put a lot of effort on pushing this further
and with the help of the community we are trying to get this merged into
QEMU eventually. You can find an overview of the up-to-date state here
[1]. Note also that, recently, we had a discussion on various on-going
inter-VM device emulation interfaces (have a look at this [2]).

In brief, the current step/goal is to get the device spec merged into the
VIRTIO spec (have a look at these [3][4]).

For more details, please just do a simple search on the spdk, dpdk,
qemu-devel and virtio-dev mailing lists. You will find a lot of threads
on this subject. If anything doesn't make sense or is not clear enough,
feel free to ask.

Nikos

The problem is that most of the time I forget to update the vhost-switch, and I run into other problems.

> If I could use a VM as a vhost-switch instead of the DPDK app, then I hope that in my endpoint code which runs on the VM, I can add functionality to make it also run as a switch, and forward the packets between the other VMs like the current DPDK switch does. Doing so would allow me to catch this out-of-sync between the VM endpoint code and the switch code at compile time, since they will be part of the same app.

This will not work in my case, as the endpoint VMs could start and stop at any time, and I don't even know how many network interfaces the endpoint VMs will have.
>
> I then found the virtio-vhost-user transport protocol [2], and was thinking that I could at least start the packet-switching VM, and then let the DPDK app inside it do the forwarding of the packets. But from what I understand, this creates a single network interface inside the VM on which the DPDK app can bind. The limitation here is that if another VM wants to connect to the packet-switching VM, I need to manually add another virtio-vhost-user-pci device (and a new vhost-user.sock) before this packet-switching VM starts, so this is not dynamic.

> I realize I made a big story and probably don't make too much sense, but one more thing. The ideal solution for me would be a combination of the vhost-user socket and the vhost-pci socket. The Qemu will start the VM and the socket will wait in the background for vhost-user connections. When a new connection is established, Qemu should create a hot-plugable PCI network card and either the guest kernel or the DPDK app inside to handle the vhost-user messages.
