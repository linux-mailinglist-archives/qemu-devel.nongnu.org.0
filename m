We have "unknown" type of error, but we should also pass an address in
the MCE event log. Strictly speaking this address should be a valid
address in the current CPU context as MCEs are synchronous errors
triggered when we touch a bad address.

We can pass a default address with every nmi, but I am not sure whether
that will be practically helpful.

If we support nmi-register and nmi-interlock calls without the monitor
command wire-up then we will be falsely claiming the nmi support to the
guest while it is not actually supported.
