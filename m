After some fiddling around, I don=E2=80=99t think this is worth it.  As I=
 said,
this is an extremely rare case anyway, so the main goal should be to
just being able to access the active layer to copy at least that data
off the image.

The other side is that this would introduce quite complex code that
basically cannot be tested reasonably.  I=E2=80=99d rather not do that.
