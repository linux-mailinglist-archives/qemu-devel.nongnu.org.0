That's right; not only are there no plans to implement virtio-mmio/1.0
for OVMF (to my knowledge), I'd even argue against such efforts.

OVMF is a heavy-weight guest firmware, which I see entirely out of scope
for "micro VMs". And so virtio-mmio/1.0 would seem like a needless &
unwelcome complication, from the OVMF maintainership perspective.

(This should not be construed as an argument against "micro VMs" -- I
always say, identify your use case, then pick the right components for
it. I never try to convince people to use OVMF indiscriminately.)

This approach makes me happy (with the understanding that edk2 guest
firmware is not going to target the new machine type(s) in question).

Thanks!
