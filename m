Yes, but I don't see how this could be done without the basic callback
infrastructure I propose here. Also forcing existing code to be
translated to coroutine-aware is probably even more complicated.

We could have the generator do that for you eventually, and spawn the corou=
tine.

thanks for looking at this old series!

That's not much change honestly. I am not sure sneaking a coroutine
behind its back is going to be simpler, I would need to look at it.

If various places of code start doing that, we are in trouble, the
stack may grow, cancellation becomes hairy.

Furthermore, in the case of screendump, IO is not necessarily within
the coroutine context. In this case, we need to wait for the QXL
device to "flush" the screen. Communicating this event back to the
coroutine isn't simpler than what I propose here.

Thanks!
