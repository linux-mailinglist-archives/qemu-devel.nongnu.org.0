Ah, I do get the overflow in the calculation of the length for
qcow2_cluster_zeroize(), but size_to_clusters() inside the function
overflows back the other direction, so this ends up with
nb_clusters =3D 0 and we don't do anything bad.

We could probably trigger a bad case with data_file_raw=3Don, but then we
don't have a backing file, so nothing sets BDRV_REQ_ZERO_WRITE.

So I guess the bug isn't even really testable, but we just add the test
in case something else in the same scenario breaks?

Kevin
