Good point.

All display devices (frontends) emulated by QEMU have to set bounds for
the permissible resolutions, for the guest. And those limits must never
break the capabilities of the display backends. So this is not a new
problem. How is it handled with other frontends? Like bochs-display, for
example -- I assume bochs-display too is purely virtual, i.e. the
resolution is fully controller (between bounds) by the guest. How is the
guest currently prevented from setting a bochs-display resolution that
"breaks SDL" (whatever that means)?

I'm inclined to agree that we're just seeing two sides of the same bug
-- the first state was too lax, and the current state is too strict.

Thanks
Laszlo
