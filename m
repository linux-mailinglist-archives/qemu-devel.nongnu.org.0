I am wondering can we block usage of "system" and "security"?  What
about guest setting acls over virtiofs files. These will have to
go through and that means we need to allow system xattrs.

Similarly setting file capabilities inside should trigger
setxattr(security.capability) and that means we need to allow security
xattr as well.

Thanks
