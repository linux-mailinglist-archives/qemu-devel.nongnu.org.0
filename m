Hm, right, I already forgot about the nested event loop again...

The AioContext lock must be held anyway, so I don't think this would be
a new requirement. As for draining, I'll have to see.

I'm currently still auditing all the callers of qcow2_cache_do_get().
The synchronous callers I already know are the snapshot functions. I
think these happen to be in a drained section anyway (or should be at
least), so AioContext lock + drain seems like a very reasonable option
for them.

For other synchronous callers, if any, maybe conversion to a coroutine
would make more sense.
