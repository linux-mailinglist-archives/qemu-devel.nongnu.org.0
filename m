At FSF, we've been working on this issue recently. I was planning to
send a general message to qemu-devel, but someone brought it up in a
thread below, so I'm doing it now.

Currently, a message sent to qemu-devel from a domain that publishes a
strict DMARC policy gets what mailman calls "Munge From". For example,
for a message sent to the list:

From: Anne Example Person <exampleperson@examplepersonsdomain>

Is modified my Mailman and sent to subscribers as:

From: Anne Example Person via Qemu-devel <qemu-devel@nongnu.org>
Reply-To: Anne Example Person <exampleperson@examplepersonsdomain>

We've recently made possible an alternative solution that does not need
munging and I call the unmodified message fix. Currently, mailman adds
"[Qemu-devel] " to the subject of messages. Modifying the message breaks
DKIM message signature and thus DMARC. In short: turn that off, and we
can stop from munging. Many lists are already this way, including most
popular @gnu and @nongnu lists, and this week we are doing a mass
conversion of lists which never touched DMARC related list settings (not
qemu-devel). Instead of using the subject prefix to identify a list,
subscribers can use the List-Id, To, and Cc headers.  List information
can also be be put in the welcome email to subscribers and the list
information page by list administrators.

Without going into all of the details, here's a few points about why we
concluded the unmodified message fix is better for discussion
lists. Email clients don't all treat munged messages the same way as
unmunged, and humans read these headers so it can confuse people,
causing messages not to be sent to the expected recipients. GNU Mailman
has an option to do "Munge From" always, but does not recommend using
it[1]. While we're not bound by what others do, it's worth noting that
other very large free software communities like Debian GNU/Linux have
adopted the unmodified message fix[2]. The unmodified messages fix
avoids breaking DKIM cryptographic signatures, which show the message
was authorized by the signing domain, which seems generally better for
security. Additionally, patchew has problems, as seen in the below
thread, subject was "[PATCH v6 0/4] 9p: Fix file ID collisions".

There is a small additional wrinkle. Very rarely, someone will send a
message to the list with a bad DKIM signature and publish a strict DMARC
policy, and in that case, we are forced to munge. I've searched all
messages posted to nongnu and gnu lists and, its always by someone
sending via their own mail server, or small enough to consider it that,
so its reasonable to ask them fix their DKIM signatures or turn off
their strict DMARC. I plan to setup an autoresponder to do that
automatically. Another case is if someone sends an html only email,
qemu-devel is configured to convert it to plaintext. That modifies the
message, and if its from a strict DMARC domain, the from munging is
done. Again, you can tell them to stop sending html only email.

I don't know who has the Qemu-devel list admin password, but whoever has
it can adopt the unmodified message fix by changing
dmarc_moderation_action to Accept here:
https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/admin/qemu-devel/privacy/sender and
remove subject_prefix here
https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/admin/qemu-devel/general

If the list admins went missing, email mailman@gnu.org and we can sort
out new ones eventually.

A few additional notes for completeness. We announced some of this at
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/savannah-hackers-public/2019-06/msg00018.html,
which includes information about other kinds of lists. For the unusual
cases of munging I described, we do from munging through exim because
mailman is not smart enough to only munge in these edge cases, and I'll
document that soon here[1].
