Leon3 uses the GRETH ethernet IP core for networking. You would need to
write a qemu emulation model of it to get networking support. The GRETH
is fairly well described in the GRLIB IP manual, so it should not be
impossible. The core is also available in open-source (VHDL) if you need
to look up some finer details ... :-)
