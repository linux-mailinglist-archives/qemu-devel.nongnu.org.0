Hmm. Should we blindly always fail for v2, or can we be a little bit 
smarter and still discard a cluster in the top layer if the backing 
layer does not also have it allocated?  In other words, is it also worth 
checking bdrv_is_allocated(), and avoiding the -ENOTSUP failure in the 
case where the backing chain does not have any allocation of the same 
range (at which point, discarding the cluster in the top layer will read 
as zeroes rather than as stale data)?

But that's a minor optimization for an older file format; it's just as 
easy to tell users that if they want maximum discarding power on their 
active layer, then they should be using v3 images.
