- Defined MIGRATION region type and sub-type.
- Used 3 bits to define VFIO device states.
  Bit 0 => _RUNNING
  Bit 1 => _SAVING
  Bit 2 => _RESUMING
  Combination of these bits defines VFIO device's state during migration
  _RUNNING => Normal VFIO device running state. When its reset, it
              indicates _STOPPED state. when device is changed to
              _STOPPED, driver should stop device before write()
              returns.
  _SAVING | _RUNNING => vCPUs are running, VFIO device is running but
                        start saving state of device i.e. pre-copy state
  _SAVING  => vCPUs are stopped, VFIO device should be stopped, and
              save device state,i.e. stop-n-copy state
  _RESUMING => VFIO device resuming state.
  _SAVING | _RESUMING and _RUNNING | _RESUMING => Invalid states
  Bits 3 - 31 are reserved for future use. User should perform
  read-modify-write operation on this field.
- Defined vfio_device_migration_info structure which will be placed at 0th
  offset of migration region to get/set VFIO device related information.
  Defined members of structure and usage on read/write access:
* device_state: (read/write)
    To convey VFIO device state to be transitioned to. Only 3 bits are
    used as of now, Bits 3 - 31 are reserved for future use.
* pending bytes: (read only)
    To get pending bytes yet to be migrated for VFIO device.
* data_offset: (read only)
    To get data offset in migration region from where data exist
    during _SAVING and from where data should be written by user space
    application during _RESUMING state.
* data_size: (read/write)
    To get and set size in bytes of data copied in migration region
    during _SAVING and _RESUMING state.

    Migration region looks like:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
    |vfio_device_migration_info|    data section                      |
    |                          |     ///////////////////////////////  |
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     ^                              ^
     offset 0-trapped part        data_offset

Structure vfio_device_migration_info is always followed by data section
in the region, so data_offset will always be non-0. Offset from where data
to be copied is decided by kernel driver, data section can be trapped or
mapped depending on how kernel driver defines data section.
Data section partition can be defined as mapped by sparse mmap capability.
If mmapped, then data_offset should be page aligned, where as initial
section which contain vfio_device_migration_info structure might not end
at offset which is page aligned.
Vendor driver should decide whether to partition data section and how to
partition the data section. Vendor driver should return data_offset
accordingly.

For user application, data is opaque. User should write data in the same
order as received.
