I would go a step further and say that the QMP monitor socket should be 
created by whoever invoked QEMU and passed down via systemd's socket 
activation protocol, with a fallback to stdin/stdout.

I agree with Mark here that configuration is beyond QEMU's role.  QEMU's 
JSON-based API isn't quite REST, but the idea is the same: the user 
talks to a tool which converts the configuration to QAPI commands.  The 
QAPI commands can be:

- invocations of qmp_* functions in the case of a command-line based 
configuration

- invocations of QMP commands on a socket if startup is mediated by a 
management tool

Where Markus and I disagree is whether the two cases should be covered 
by one binary or two.  Personally I don't see much advantage in having a 
single binary, just like I don't care if /bin/ls and /bin/dir are 
symlinks, or they're separate binaries, or one invokes the other.

What matters to me is the maintainability of the command-line based 
startup code.  Actual experience says that, as more and more options are 
supported via QMP-based configuration, the command-line based startup 
code gets simpler or at least more self-contained.

In the terms of my KVM Forum talk, this is obtained by converting 
"one-off" options (typically global variables) to a combination of a 
"shortcut" option (typically a qemu_opts_set or qemu_opts_parse 
invocation) and a QOM property or a QMP command.  Examples from recent 
QEMU versions include -no-shutdown, -no-hpet, -no-acpi.

There are two kinds of incremental changes.  Incremental changes to the 
UI are one thing; incremental changes to the implementations aka 
refactoring is another.

I agree that further incremental changes to the UI (in the style of 
-preconfig) are impractical, but incremental changes to the 
implementation are totally practical.  The reason for that is that there 
*is* a way forward for decoupling the options from the command line 
parsing code, and this way forward has *already* proved itself.

This is what I have in my tree, though it's called climain.c and 
qmpmain.c. :)  There is one major difference though: refactoring bits of 
vl.c to use more of QMP/QOM *is* the way you add functionality in qmpmain.c.

I disagree that vl.c is hard to refactor.  Sure there were some issues 
in 6.0/6.1, but at this point a lot of the hard parts have been done. 
The conversion of -smp to a QOM option, for example, was largely painless.

I'm not sure if this is possible if the new binaries provide exclusively 
a machine-oriented (JSON) interface.  But as you said, the pressure to 
keep a backwards-compatible command line would be much less with a good 
machine-oriented binary.

I agree.  Though in my case I'd still go for two binaries: one with good 
CLI and limited QMP, and one with limited CLI and good QMP.

Agreed, but I would set the beginning of the "2 years or so" at last year...

... and if you compare vl.c in 5.2 and now, and consider current vl.c to 
be horrible, my knowedge of English does not include an adjective to 
describe the 5.2 state.  Some incremental work _is_ possible or even 
necessary, and has been done already.
