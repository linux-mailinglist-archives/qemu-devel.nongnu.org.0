My goal when I wrote the patch was to make the doc-building work out of
the box on systems where sphinx-build gets you a Python 2 Sphinx, which
does not work for us, and sphinx-build-3 gets you one that does.

I patterned the Sphinx check after the Python check: first the -3. and
only then the indeterminate version.

I won't object to a patch that makes things better for you without
making them worse for me :)
