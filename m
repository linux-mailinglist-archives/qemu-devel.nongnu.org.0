Hopefully we can make the checks correct eventually. I think for sm501 it 
should already be OK, I'll need to check ati-vga again because I think 
there may be still a mistake in that. (It does not help that every device 
encode these values differently in registers.)

I prefer performance here if security can be achieved without loss of 
performance with correct checks so rather fix the checks until they are 
correct than do additional things in a loop.

Pixman does left to right, top to bottom so we don't need special handling 
for such blits, they will work even for overlapping areas. Doing non 
overlapping blits should also work with whatever direction (but AmigaOS 
seems to use rtl as default even for non overlapping, maybe hardware 
prefers that or was easier to code somehow). The only case where pixman 
does not work is reverse direction overlapping areas which is checked 
here, although becuase of different strides and offsets it's hard to check 
exactly so we only do a crude check to see if the memory areas are 
overlapping at all. This should catch all bad cases and maybe some good 
ones but checking for those is probably as expensive as doing the blit 
instead. As you said this may not work in some cases but until we come 
across such cases I'd go with this simpler solution because otherwise we 
likely need to implement our own optimised blit routine.

Unlike ati-vga, sm501 does not have independent direction bits so rtl 
seems to mean both right to left and bottom to top. Ati-vga has different 
bit for bottom to top so those with left to right could still use 
pixman_blt calling it in a reverse counting loop for every line but I did 
not go for that optimisation yet. For sm501 there's no such option. 
Possible furher optimisation could be handling 1 pixel and small regions 
directly where the overhead of calling pixman may be bigger than the gain 
from its optimised routines but I would need to measure that for which I 
have no time.

You should. It's seriously undocumented and using it seems to need digging 
the code or maybe I've missed all the wonderful documentation?

To my knowledge the sm501 is only used on an SH4 machine, the sam460ex and 
to run MorphOS on mac99 but ati-vga is already better for the latter so 
these are not security critical in my opinion.
