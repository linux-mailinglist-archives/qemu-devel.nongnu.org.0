I'm not very familiar with the debug interface (we don't model
it in QEMU), but I think that is the wrong end of it. These
are bits in AUTHSTATUS, which is a read-only register provided
by the CPU to the debugger. It basically says "am I, the CPU,
going to permit you, the debugger, to debug code running
in secure mode, or in EL2". (The CPU gets to decide this:
for security some h/w will not want any random with access
to the jtag debug port to be able to just read out code from
the secure world, for instance.)

What the debugger gets to control is bits in the CSW register
in the "MEM-AP"; it can use these to specify the size of
a memory access it wants to make to the guest, and also
the 'type', which is IMPDEF but typically lets the debugger
say "code access vs data access", "privileged vs usermode"
and "secure vs non-secure".

The equivalent in the QEMU world is that the debugger can
specify the memory transaction attributes. The question is
whether the gdb protocol provides any equivalent of that:
if it doesn't then gdbstub.c has to make up an attribute and
use that.

You shouldn't set 'unspecified =3D 1', because that indicates
"this is MEMTXATTRS_UNSPECIFIED". The default set of
unspecified-attributes are probably good enough,
though, so you can just use MEMTXATTRS_UNSPECIFIED.

The trouble is that the command isn't precise enough.
"read/write to physical memory" is fine if the CPU has
exactly one physical address space, but it's ambiguous if the CPU
has more than one physical address space. Either we need the
user to be able to tell us which one they wanted somehow
(which for QEMU more or less means that they should tell
us what tx attributes they wanted), or we need to make an
arbitrary decision.

PS: do we have any documentation of this new command ?
ab4752ec8d9 has the implementation but no documentation...

thanks
