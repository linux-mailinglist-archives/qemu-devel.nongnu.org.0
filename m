Apparently the bisection result from comment #1 comes from a different
issue, the VGA display stays blank, can not test the floppy drive.

Bisecting using the pcbios.bin from fd646122418~, the VGA display stops

    roms: remove option rom packing logic
    =

    Now that we load the option roms via fw_cfg, we can stop copying
    them to the 0xc000 -> 0xe000.  The patch does just that.
    =

    Also the rom loader gets simplified as all remaining users of the
    rom loader load the bits at a fixed address so the packing and
    aligning logic can go away.
