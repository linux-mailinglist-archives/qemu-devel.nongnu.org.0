Important precision for Damien, IIUC we can not migrate float/double types.

This is very clear, thanks Peter!

The period+period_frac split allow us to migrate the 96 bits:

         VMSTATE_UINT32(period_frac, ptimer_state),
         VMSTATE_INT64(period, ptimer_state),

Similarly to SystemC, the QEMUTimers macro use a 'scale' unit, of:

#define SCALE_MS 1000000
#define SCALE_US 1000
#define SCALE_NS 1

I think storing the period as an integer type is a good idea.

However if we store the period in nanoseconds, we get at most 1GHz 
frequency.

The attosecond granularity feels overkill.

If we use a 96-bit integer to store picoseconds and use similar SCALE 
macros we get to 1THz.

Regardless the unit chosen, as long it is integer, we can migrate it.
If can migrate the period, we don't need to migrate the frequency.
We can then use the float type in with the timer API to pass frequencies 
(which in the modeled hardware are ratios, likely not integers).

So we could use set_freq(100e6 / 3), set_freq(40e6 / 5.5) directly.

Back to your series, I wonder why you want to store the frequency in 
ClockIn. ClockIn shouldn't be aware at what frequency it is clocked. 
What matters is ClockOut, and each device exposing ClockOuts has a 
(migrated) state of the output frequencies (rather in fields, or encoded 
in registers). Once migrated, after the state is loaded back into the 
device, we call post_load(). Isn't it a good place to call 
clock_set_frequency(ClockOut[]) which will correctly set each ClockIn 
frequency.

IOW I don't think ClockIn/ClockOut require to migrate a frequency field.
