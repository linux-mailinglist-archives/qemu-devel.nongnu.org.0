I'm open to suggestions on how many initial bits should be provided.  In 
fact, if we wanted, we could have a pair mutually-exclusive bits, 
advertising:
00 - no information known
01 - image is completely sparse
10 - image is completely allocated
11 - error

The goal of providing a 16-bit answer (or we could mandate 32 or 64 
bits, if we think we will ever want to extend that far) was to make it 
easier to add in whatever other initial-state extensions that someone 
could find useful.  Until we're happy with the design, the size or any 
given bit assignment is not locked down; once we do start committing any 
of this series, we've locked in what interoperability will demand but 
still have spare bits as future extensions.
