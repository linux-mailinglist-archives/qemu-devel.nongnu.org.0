So then why print a warning when it will change again when the build=20
system is replaced? Isn't it enough to worry about it at that point? If i=
t=20
works now as before then no need to constantly bug people at every=20
cofigure invocation. Simply put a warning in changelog that current build=
=20
system is deprecated and will be replaced with something else like Meson=20
in some future release and that should be enough to notify people about=20
the coming change. You don't print warnings for every other deprecated=20
features either.

Ideally a change in build system should make it more convenient to work=20
with not more inconvenient otherwise it's questionable if we want to=20
introduce it at all but we'll see then. But then why bug people with a 14=
=20
line warning now if they'll have to change their ways again shortly? I=20
thought you wanted to get rid of in-tree builds now to ease the=20
maintenance of current make system and the convenience makefile would=20
help that.

I did not say that. What I said was that you can change or replace the=20
build system with whatever you want as long as I can still run make (or=20
equivalently simple command) in source dir and it will build the project.=
=20
I can live with build results moved to a subdir to ease your task of=20
managing build system so you don't have to support two ways of building=20
now. But if you say this will still work for now and don't mind continue=20
to support it as before at least until a new build system is introduced=20
I'm happy with that too. I'll raise same complaints against new build=20
system then when it's about to be merged.
