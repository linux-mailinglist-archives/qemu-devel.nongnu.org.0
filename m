YAGNI.

Where personal preference collides with local consistency, I'm with
local consistency.

You can get the two in line: change everything to your preference.

You signalled intent to do that for __repr__(): "Give me time".
Alright, having such __repr__() is obviously more important / useful to
you than avoiding the extra code is to me.

I received no such signal for checking preconditions.  Good, because I'd
go "are you serious?" :)
