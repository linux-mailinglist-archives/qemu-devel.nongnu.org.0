I guess it depends on your interpretation of the docs. In qemu-img
man page it says

  "falloc" mode preallocates space for image by calling posix_fallocate()=
.
  "full" mode preallocates space for image by writing zeros to underlying
  storage.

To me both those sentances are talking about the lowest level in the
stack, closest to the physical storage medium, though I can understand
if people have other interpretations.

Overhead is not purely about CPU burn. There's non-negligible memory
overhead for qcow2s data tables that doesn't exist at all with raw.
The mgmt complexity & interoperability is the real killer feature
benefit of raw + LUKS vs qcow + LUKS though.
