Yes, I first replicated the issue by removing "max_outputs=3D1", then
patched spice server, and the issue no longer happens.

QEMU 4.1.0 still changed something.  If I understand correctly, it's now
in some circumstances saying there are 0 monitors, even though there's a
graphic card?

Fixing this in spice to effectively ignore being told 0, and go with 1
instead, gets around the bug, but still makes me think there's something
wrong in QEMU 4.1.0.  Granted, perhaps with this spice fix, it might not
cause any negative effects anymore.

But, I don't know if there are any third party applications especially
on Windows that don't use upstream spice-server and might be thrown off
by this in a similar way.  So, I wonder if QEMU 4.1.0 should still have
something fixed.

Title:
  Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.  virt-viewer 8.0.

  Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

  Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using
  integrated ASPEED graphics.

  Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DNyMdcYwOCvY

  Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH3nGG2Mk6i0

  4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.

  Using 4.1.0 with virtio-vga doesn't cause this.
