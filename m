It's the vmx features that the PATCH 1 wants to add. They require VMX to 
be there because feature_dependencies[] checking in 
x86_cpu_expand_features().

Paolo didn't met this issue because he added VMX features to named CPU 
models directly without adding new versions. Chenyi have to deal with it 
since you require them to be added in a new version. He wants to add 
{vmx, on} in the new version to avoid the warning. But I don't think 
that's a good idea since other CPU models don't have VMX.
