That would be good to have!

From what I read from the code Qemu emulates the Block Limits VPD Page for virtio-scsi, but the limits there are not taken from the backend driver. They can be passed as config to the virtio-scsi device.

However, Qemu uses all the Block Limit that can be found in include/block/block_int.h in the BlockLimits struct to generate optimal requests if it comes to block operations like mirroring, or zeroing of a whole

device etc. Some of the alignments (e.g. the request alignment) have direct influence and make Qemu split requests from the guest or even make RMW cycles.

If my understanding is incorrect please anyone correct me.


It would indeed be nice to have an option to propagate the settings from the backend driver into the Guest. But from my understanding this is not there yet.


So I would leave it as it. Drop the request_alignment = 512 (like in the patch) and just advertise the cluster_size at obj_size. This is already in the rbd driver today.

The cluster_size e.g. is used in any qemu-img convert operation to align read / write requests and size them apropiately.
