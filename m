| 
|   --use-vnet --fd=sv[1] --br=bridge
| 
| only bridge name is supplied by user; Which is anyway comming without 'helper'

| invocation
| 
|   if (strstr(helper, "--br=") == NULL) {
|       snprintf(br_buf, sizeof(br_buf), "%s%s", "--br=", bridge);
|   }
| 
| '--br=bridge' has limited scope to use shell meta characters, ie. other than 
| space(' ') and tab('\t').
| 
| 
| | The QEMU man page has never documented that you can pass a command
| | and args, which get sent via the shell though. It only ever documented
| | the helper arg as being a plain qualified binary path.
| | 
| | So the question is how strictly we need to consider compatibility.
| | 
| | The "if it isn't documented it never existed" option is to use your
| | patch here.
| 
| We don't know if "/path/to/helper arg1 arg2" usage exists in practice. And 
| considering user would still be able to supply 'bridge' argument, I wonder if 
| we are breaking compatibility.
| 
| | The safest option is to put in a place a deprecation saying we'll
| | drop use of shell in future, only implementing the aggressive
| | option in a later release.
| 
| ie. for Qemu > v4.0.0? How do we do this?
| 
| | Perhaps from your POV, the easy thing is to avoid this entire
| | question - just leave the code calling shell, but switch to
| | g_strdup_printf instead of snprintf.
| 
| Okay, this will be for Qemu <= v4.0.0?
