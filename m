I think we've already hashed through that the version is represented by
a string, but interpretation of that string is reserved for the vendor
driver.  I believe this particular thread started out as a question of
whether QEMU is right to validate target compatibility by comparing the
migration region size versus the source, which I see as an overstep of
leaving the compatibility testing to the vendor driver.  A write
exceeding the migration region is clearly a protocol violation, but
unless we're going to scan the entire migration stream to look for that
violation, it's the vendor driver's business where and how it exposes
data within the region.  IOW, different migration region sizes might
suggest to be suspicious, but nothing in our specification requires
that the target region is at least as big as the source.

If we had a mechanism to report and test the migration version through
this migration API, using similar semantics to the sysfs interface,
what would we actually do with it?  The vendor driver's processing of
an incoming migration stream cannot rely on the user.  I initially
struggled with Kirti's use of "should" rather than "must" in describing
this checking, but I think that might actually be correct.  If a user
chooses to ignore the sysfs interface for compatibility testing, or
otherwise chooses to allow the data stream to be corrupted or
manipulated, I think the only requirement of the vendor driver is to
contain the damage to the user's device.  So, I think we're really
looking at whether it's a benefit to the user to be able to retrieve
the version and test it on the target through the migration API.  IOW,
is it sufficient for QEMU to presume that a well informed agent, that
has already tested the source and target device compatibility, has setup
this migration and that a well supported mdev vendor driver should fail
the migration gracefully if the versions are incompatible, or contain
the error within the user's device otherwise, or is there value to be
gained if QEMU performs a separate compatibility test?  Thanks,

Alex
