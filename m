My main argument against counting backing files is that we=E2=80=99ve nev=
er done it.

(Whereas for quorum, I=E2=80=99d argue we just forgot to adjust
bdrv_get_allocated_file_size() for it.)

That=E2=80=99s actually a good idea for a quorum mode in general.  Who sa=

Well, I mean, we did forget adding it for qcow2.

Hm.  Seems a bit much, but if we can=E2=80=99t agree on what=E2=80=99s a =
good general
implementation that works for everything, this is probably the only
thing that would actually keep us from forgetting to add special cases.

Though I actually don=E2=80=99t know.  I=E2=80=99d probably add two globa=
lly available
helpers, one that returns the sum of everything but the backing node,
and one that just returns the primary node.

Now if I were to make qcow2 use the primary node helper function, would
we have remembered changing it once we added a data file?

Hmm.  Maybe not, but it should be OK to just make everything use the sum
helper, except the drivers that want the primary node.  That should work
for all cases.  (I think that whenever a format driver suddenly gains
more child nodes, we probably will want to count them.  OTOH, everything
that has nodes that shouldn=E2=80=99t be counted probably always wants to=
 use
the primary node helper function from the start.)

I didn=E2=80=99t answer that because I didn=E2=80=99t disagree.

That=E2=80=99s of course exactly what we=E2=80=99re trying to do, but the=
 question is,
how do we figure out that storage children?  Make it a per-BdrvChild
attribute?  That seems rather heavy-handed, because I think we=E2=80=99d =
need it
only here.

I don=E2=80=99t think quorum is a filter, and blkverify can only be justi=
fied to
be a filter because it quits qemu when there is a mismatch.

The better example is replication, but that has a clear filtered child
(the primary node).


So all in all I think it=E2=80=99s best to make the callback mandatory an=
d add
two global helper functions.  That=E2=80=99s simple enough and should pre=
vent us
from making mistakes by forgetting to adjust something in the future.
