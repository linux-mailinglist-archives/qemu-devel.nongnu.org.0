If the mssim implmentation doesn't provide TLS itself, then I don't
consider that a blocker on the QEMU side, merely a nice-to-have.

With swtpm the control channel is being used to load and store state
during the migration dance. This makes the use of an external process
largely transparent to the user, since QEMU handles all the state
save/load as part of its migration data stream.

With mssim there is state save/load co-ordination with QEMU. Instead
whomever/whatever is managing the mssim instance, is responsible for
ensuring it is running with the correct state at the time QEMU does
a vmstate load. If doing a live migration this co-ordination is trivial
if you just use the same mssim instance for both src/dst to connect to.

If doing save/store to disk, the user needs to be able to save the mssim
state and load it again later. If doing snapshots and reverting to old
snapshots, then again whomever manages mssim needs to be keeping saved
TPM state corresponding to each QEMU snapshot saved, and picking the
right one when restoring to old snapshots.

QEMU exposes enough functionality to enable a mgmt app / admin user to
achieve all of this.

This is not as seemlessly integrated with swtpm is, but it is still
technically posssible todo the right thing with migration from QEMU's
POV. Whether or not the app/person managing mssim instance actually
does the right thing in practice is not a concern of QEMU. I don't
see a need for a migration blocker here.

With regards,
Daniel
