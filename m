That seems like conflicting goals.  The field property API is based on 
getters and setters hidden in PropertyInfo.  The "other" property API is 
based on getters and setters in plain sight in the declaration of the 
property.

Finding the array would also require finding calls buried deep in C 
code, wouldn't they?

How would you do custom setters and getters then---without separate 
PropertyInfos, without Property literals, and without an exploding 
number of macros?

We can use grep or Coccinelle or manual code review to identify 
problematic cases.

Yes, I'm only considering object_class_property calls.  Those are the 
ones that I claim aren't being misused enough for this to be a problem.

Making instance-level properties appear in the schema is a completely 
different kind of conversion, because there is plenty of manual work 
(and unsolved problems for e.g. subobject property aliases).

I would like an example of the complexity of those code paths.  I don't 
see much complexity, as long as the object exists at all, and I don't 
see how it would be simpler to find the code paths that lead to 
object_class_add_field_properties.
