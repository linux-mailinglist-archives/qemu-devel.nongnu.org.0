As far as I can tell, the NFS protocol has nothing equivalent to
O_NOATIME and thus can't honor it. Feel free to test it:

  # mount -t nfs -o vers=4,rw 10.0.2.2:/ /mnt
  # echo foo > /mnt/foo
  # touch -d "1 hour ago" /mnt/foo
  # stat /mnt/foo | grep 'Access: [0-9]'
  Access: 2020-04-16 10:43:36.838952593 -0700
  # # Drop caches so we have to go to the NFS server.
  # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
  # strace -e openat dd if=/mnt/foo of=/dev/null iflag=noatime |& grep /mnt/foo
  openat(AT_FDCWD, "/mnt/foo", O_RDONLY|O_NOATIME) = 3
  # stat /mnt/foo | grep 'Access: [0-9]'
  Access: 2020-04-16 11:43:36.906462928 -0700

The exact phrasing in the man-page is: "EPERM  The O_NOATIME flag was
specified, but the effective user ID of the caller did not match the
owner of the file and the caller was not privileged." IMO, it's about
whether the (guest) process has permission from the (guest) kernel's
point of view, not whether the filesystem could satisfy it.

The guest kernel will still check whether processes on the guest have
permission to use O_NOATIME. This only changes the behavior when the
guest kernel believes that the process has permission even though the
host QEMU process doesn't.

If you'd still like to preserve this behavior, would it be acceptable to
make this a QEMU option? Maybe something like "-virtfs
honor_noatime=no": the default would be "yes", which is the current
behavior, and "no" would always mask out NOATIME.

My use case is running tests on different versions of the Linux kernel
while reusing the host's userspace environment. I export the host's root
filesystem read-only to the guest via 9pfs, and the guest sets up
overlayfs on top of it (to allow certain modifications) and chroots into
that. Without a workaround like the LD_PRELOAD one I mentioned in the
commit message, any (read) accesses to files owned by root on the host
(like /bin/sh) will fail.
