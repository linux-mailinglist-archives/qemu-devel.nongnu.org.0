This should be fully reviewed now, but the Timer patch may deserve another
look, as I fixed a few bugs in it. Huge thanks to everyone who reviewed and=
/or
tested this patchset, it has clearly improved a lot since I started.

I also pushed this and the previous patchsets to my qemu fork on github.  T=
he
branches are named npcm7xx-v[1-9].

  https://github.com/hskinnemoen/qemu

This patch series models enough of the Nuvoton NPCM730 and NPCM750 SoCs to =
boot
an OpenBMC image built for quanta-gsj. This includes device models for:

  - Global Configuration Registers
  - Clock Control
  - Timers
  - Fuses
  - Memory Controller
  - Flash Controller

These modules, along with the existing Cortex A9 CPU cores and built-in
peripherals, are integrated into a NPCM730 or NPCM750 SoC, which in turn fo=
rm
the foundation for the quanta-gsj and npcm750-evb machines, respectively. T=
he
two SoCs are very similar; the only difference is that NPCM730 is missing s=
ome
peripherals that NPCM750 has, and which are not considered essential for
datacenter use (e.g. graphics controllers). For more information, see

https://www.nuvoton.com/products/cloud-computing/ibmc/

Both quanta-gsj and npcm750-evb correspond to real boards supported by Open=
BMC.
At the end of the series, qemu can boot an OpenBMC image built for one of t=
hese
boards with some minor modifications.

The patches in this series were developed by Google and reviewed by Nuvoton=
. We
will be maintaining the machine and peripheral support together.

The data sheet for these SoCs is not generally available. Please let me kno=
w if
more comments are needed to understand the device behavior.

Changes since v8:

  - Add missing class_size initializer for TYPE_NPCM7XX_OTP.
  - Timer bug fixes:
    - Interrupt Enable bit should not be reserved.
    - Update expiration time and/or time remaining on prescaler changes.
    - Warn when CEN and CRST are both set, and force CEN to zero.
    - Fix crash when the timer is loaded with zero cycles, and CEN is set a=
nd
      cleared in the same cycle (found by Alexander Bulekov's fuzz testing)=
.
    - Update CACT when CEN changes.
    - De-assert interrupts when TISR bits are cleared by guest writes.
  - Load the bootrom for direct kernel boot if it's available, but don't er=
ror
    out if it's not.
  - Add the usual openbmc password to the arm/nuvoton docs.

Changes since v7:

  - Move register enums to .c files throughout, leaving a single
    NPCM7XX_FOO_NR_REGS definition behind in the .h file. A QEMU_BUILD_BUG_=
ON
    should alert anyone accidentally expanding the register enum that they =
need
    to update the corresponding NR_REGS define, which in turn has a comment
    reminding them to update the vmstate version_id as well.
  - Skip loading the bootrom if a kernel filename is provided by the user.
  - New patch adding a board setup stub to tweak clocks before booting dire=
ctly
    into the kernel.
  - Add stuff to meson files instead of Makefiles.
  - Try to disable the slowest drivers and services to speed up the flash b=
oot
    acceptance test a bit. This is somewhat based on the following
    systemd-analyze blame report:
    https://gist.github.com/hskinnemoen/475cb0676530cd2cebaa1754cf16ca97

Changes since v6:

  - Use size_to_str to report DRAM sizes in npcm7xx_gcr.
  - Simplify the interrupt logic in npcm7xx_timer.
  - Update global bios_name instead of temporary.
  - Add npcm7xx_bootrom to MAINTAINERS and pc-bios/README.
  - Use a predefined name for the gsj boot image in the acceptance test.

Changes since v5:

  - Boot ROM included, as a git submodule and a binary blob, and loaded by
    default, so the -bios option is usually not necessary anymore.
  - Two acceptance tests added (openbmc image boot, and direct kernel boot)=
.
  - npcm7xx_load_kernel() moved to SoC code.
  - NPCM7XX_TIMER_REF_HZ definition moved to CLK header.
  - Comments added clarifying available SPI flash chip selects.
  - Error handling adjustments:
      - Errors from CPU and GCR realization are propagated through the SoC
        since they may be triggered by user-configurable parameters.
      - Machine init uses error_fatal instead of error_abort for SoC
        realization flash init. This makes error messages more helpful.
      - Comments added to indicate whether peripherals may fail to realize.
      - Use ERRP_GUARD() instead of Error *err when possible.
  - Default CPU type is now set, and attempting to set it to anything else
    will fail.
  - Format string fixes (use HWADDR_PRIx, etc.)
  - Simplified memory size encoding and error checking in npcm7xx_gcr.
  - Encapsulate non-obvious pointer subtraction into helper functions in th=
e
    FIU and TIMER modules.
  - Incorporate review feedback into the FIU module:
      - Add select/deselect trace events.
      - Use npcm7xx_fiu_{de,}select() consistently.
      - Use extract/deposit in more places for consistency.
      - Use -Wimplicit-fallthrough compatible fallthrough comments.
      - Use qdev_init_gpio_out_named instead of sysbus_init_irq for chip
        selects.
  - Incorporate review feedback into the TIMER module:
      - Assert that we never pause a timer that has already expired, instea=
d of
        trying to handle it. This should be safe since QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL i=
s
        stopped while this code is running.
      - Simplify the switch blocks in the read and write handlers.

I made a change to error out if a flash drive was not specified, but revert=
ed
it because it caused make check to fail (qom-test). When specifying a NULL
block device, the m25p flash device initializes its in-memory storage with =
0xff
and doesn't attempt to write anything back. This seems correct to me.

Changes since v4:

  - OTP cleanups suggested by Philippe Mathieu-Daud=C3=A9.
      - Added fuse array definitions based on public Nuvoton bootblock code=
.
      - Moved class structure to .c file since it's only used internally.
      - Readability improvements.
  - Split the first patch and folded parts of it into three other patches s=
o
    that CONFIG_NPCM7XX is only enabled after the initial NPCM7xx machine
    support is added.
  - DRAM init moved to machine init code.
  - Consistently use lower-case hex literals.
  - Switched to fine-grained unimplemented devices, based on public bootblo=
ck
    source code. Added a tiny SRAM that got left out previously.
  - Simplified error handling in npcm7xx_realize() since the board code wil=
l
    abort anyway, and SoCs are not hot-pluggable.

Changes since v3:

  - License headers are now GPL v2-or-later throughout.
  - Added vmstate throughout (except the memory controller, which doesn't
    really have any state worth saving). Successfully booted a gsj image
    with two stop/savevm/quit/loadvm cycles along the way.
      - JFFS2 really doesn't like it if I let qemu keep running after savev=
m,
        and then jump back in time with loadvm. I assume this is expected.
  - Fixed an error API violation in npcm7xx_realize, removed pointless erro=
r
    check after object_property_set_link().
  - Switched the OTP device to use an embedded array instead of a g_malloc0=
'd
    one because I couldn't figure out how to set up vmstate for the latter.

Changes since v2:

  - Simplified the MAINTAINERS entry.
  - Added link to OpenPOWER jenkins for gsj BMC images.
  - Reverted the smpboot change, back to byte swapping.
  - Adapted to upstream API changes:
      - sysbus_init_child_obj -> object_initialize_child
      - object_property_set_bool -> qdev_realize / sysbus_realize
      - ssi_create_slave_no_init -> qdev_new
      - qdev_init_nofail -> qdev_realize_and_unref
      - ssi_auto_connect_slaves removed
  - Moved Boot ROM loading from soc to machine init.
  - Plumbed power-on-straps property from GCR to the machine init code so i=
t
    can be properly initialized. Turns out npcm750 memory init doesn't work
    without this. npcm730 is fine either way, though I'm not sure why.
  - Reworked the flash init code so it looks more like aspeed (i.e. the fla=
sh
    device gets added even if there's no drive).

Changes since v1 (requested by reviewers):

  - Clarify the source of CLK reset values.
  - Made smpboot a constant byte array, eliinated byte swapping.
  - NPCM7xxState now stores an array of ARMCPUs, not pointers to ARMCPUs.
  - Clarify why EL3 is disabled.
  - Introduce NPCM7XX_NUM_IRQ constant.
  - Set the number of CPUs according to SoC variant, and disallow command l=
ine
    overrides (i.e. you can no longer override the number of CPUs with the =
-smp
    parameter). This is trying to follow the spirit of
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11595407/.
  - Switch register operations to DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN throughout.
  - Machine documentation added (new patch).

Changes since v1 to support flash booting:

  - GCR reset value changes to get past memory initialization when booting
    from flash (patches 2 and 5):
      - INTCR2 now indicates that the DDR controller is initialized.
      - INTCR3 is initialized according to DDR memory size. A realize()
	method was implemented to achieve this.
  - Refactor the machine initialization a bit to make it easier to drop in
    machine-specific flash initialization (patch 6).
  - Extend the series with additional patches to enable booting from flash:
      - Boot ROM (through the -bios option).
      - OTP (fuse) controller.
      - Memory Controller stub (just enough to skip memory training).
      - Flash controller.
      - Board-specific flash initialization.

Thanks for reviewing,

Havard
