That's not true. We chose not to make that a "recommended" interface, and
instead we add new commands. However that's mostly to avoid tying our hands
and not making too much of QOM part of the API. But I would be very
surprised if a guest could be broken with qom-set.

This was definitely not the case when QOM was introduced in a half-baked
state, but let's not indulge in self-flagellation more than it's actually
necessary.

<br>
&gt; As for the =E2=80=9Cpublic=E2=80=9D aspects of a QOM object, that is s=
tatic if it<br>
&gt; comes from QAPI, so why couldn=E2=80=99t we define it there?<br>
<br>
QAPI specifies a certain kind of data types.<br>
<br>
QOM &quot;specifies&quot; data types as an imperative program for creating =
them.<br>
Maximally flexible, and fundamentally at odds with static analysis.<br>
I&#39;ve hated this since day one.<br>
<br>
There&#39;s no hard reason why QOM could not specify static aspects<br>
declaratively.=C2=A0 It just doesn&#39;t, and changing it now would be a<br=
>
monumental task.<br>
<br>
The imperative program mostly creates identical data types every time.<br>
In other words, the data types are static.=C2=A0 Two problems.=C2=A0 One,<b=
r>
converting such a program to an equivalent declaration takes manual<br>
labor.=C2=A0 Two, there are exceptions, and identifying them is more manual=
<br>
labor.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the same way, QAPI can&#39;t say anything about the structure =
of a QOM<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; object, and I think that&#39;s a problem.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - which, as far as I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand, is mainly because QOM properties aren&#39;=
t necessarily static,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so we can&#39;t provide a statically defined interface=
 for them. Probably<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; solvable in QEMU, but not without a major effort.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Or maybe extend the language so that it=E2=80=99s internal=
 semantics<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows about this aspect of QOM?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; My point is that for example you can&#39;t generate a C struct=
 (which is<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; statically defined) from something that has a dynamic structur=
e. The<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; best you could do is fall back to key=3Dvalue even in the C so=
urce, both<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; key and value being strings. But then you still have to parse =
these<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; strings manually, so it doesn&#39;t actually help much compare=
d to a state<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; without C bindings.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I really don=E2=80=99t understand that point. To me, all these operati=
ons<br>
&gt; seem relatively simple to generate.<br>
<br>
Yes, if the QAPI fairy gives us a declarative specification equivalent<br>
to the existing imperative one, then replacing the hand-written<br>
imperative code by code generated from the declarative specification<br>
would be relatively simple.<br>
<br>
&gt; I think that what confuses me is when you write =E2=80=9Csomething tha=
t has a<br>
&gt; dynamic structure=E2=80=9D. I understand that as referring to the stru=
cture<br>
&gt; defined in the schema. But the schema itself is static. So you can<br>
&gt; generate static code from it, and it=E2=80=99s already done today.<br>
<br>
QAPI data types are static.<br>
<br>
QOM types are not.=C2=A0 They&#39;re effectively almost static in practice.=
<br>
<br>
&gt; Another hypothesis on my side is that we don=E2=80=99t want, ever, to<=
br>
&gt; have the API provide for example the option to create its own<br>
&gt; arbitrary QOM classes, or to tag arbitrary properties to an object,<br=

&gt; where by =E2=80=9Carbitrary=E2=80=9D I mean not explicitly mentioned s=
omewhere in<br>
&gt; something like the schema.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; So I suspect you are talking about something else.<br>
<br>
Kevin&#39;s talking about the imperative code creating different QOM<br>
properties depending on how and in what context it is run.<br>
<br>
QOM is perfectly capable of supporting a QMP command to add arbitrary<br>
QOM properties to an object at run time, or even add arbitrary QOM<br>
types, but as you wrote we don&#39;t want that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; QOM and QAPI sabotage each other.=C2=A0 Ironic, considering they w=
ere dreamed<br>
&gt;&gt; up by the same guy :)<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; QAPI is compile-time static by design.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; QOM is run-time dynamic by design.=C2=A0 Some support for static d=
efinitions<br>
&gt;&gt; has been grafted on since.<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; We use QAPI type system escapes for QOM.=C2=A0 Defeats QAPI intros=
pection and<br>
&gt;&gt; doc generation.=C2=A0 We provide separate QOM introspection instea=
d, which is<br>
&gt;&gt; clumsier and less expressive.=C2=A0 QOM documentation doesn&#39;t =
exist.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; But back to the original discussion about management tools,<br>
&gt; do we let upper layers tag their own arbitrary stuff in QOM objects?<b=
r>
<br>
We don&#39;t want management applications to add QOM properties for their<b=
r>
own purposes.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe what could be done is covering at least the static prope=
rties and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; then having key=3Dvalue for the dynamic part (which should be =
the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; exception).<br>
&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt; To make this worthwhile, we&#39;d have to replace dynamic QOM prop=
erties by<br>
&gt;&gt; static ones when possible.=C2=A0 Monumental task.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I=E2=80=99m sure you are right, but it=E2=80=99s hard for me to evalua=
te, given how<br>
&gt; many ways there are to access an object. Naively, grepping for<br>
&gt; set_prop and for new_with_prop does not give me that many hits.<br>
<br>
Look for object_property_add*().=C2=A0 Some 450 hits.<br>
<br>
See also object_class_property_add(), grafted on in<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 qom: Allow properties to be registered against classes<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 When there are many instances of a given class, registering<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 properties against the instance is wasteful of resources. The=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 majority of objects have a statically defined list of possibl=
e<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 properties, so most of the properties are easily registerable=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 against the class. Only those properties which are conditiona=
lly<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 registered at runtime need be recorded against the klass.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Registering properties against classes also makes it possible=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 to provide static introspection of QOM - currently introspect=
ion<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 is only possible after creating an instance of a class, which=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 severely limits its usefulness.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 This impl only supports simple scalar properties. It does not=
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 attempt to allow child object / link object properties agains=
t<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the class. There are ways to support those too, but it would<=
br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 make this patch more complicated, so it is left as an exercis=
e<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 for the future.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 There is no equivalent to object_property_del() provided, sin=
ce<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 classes must be immutable once they are defined.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Relations, e.g. how we represent =E2=80=9Ccontai=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - States, e.g. how do we represent the machine con=
figuration,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or the desired new disk setting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Verbs, e.g. how we represent =E2=80=9Cadd=E2=80=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =E2=80=9Cstart=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cnotify=E2=80=9D,=
 etc. and how we describe the kind of input they need.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Possibly more subtle things like support for tra=
nsactions, commit/rollback,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i.e. =E2=80=9CI want to add connect a virtual nic =
to some host vf, but if anything<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; along the way fails, I=E2=80=99d like all the clea=
nup to happen automatically)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This sounds like a different approach from our current=
 QAPI command set<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, except for purposefully trying to use a different wo=
rding to avoid<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the risk of getting your mind stuck in one of the particul=
ar existing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; meta-languages in QEMU, the approach is not very different=
.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn&#39;t necessarily mean relations/state/verbs, which obv=
iously exist,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; but the examples that seemed to express things in a deliberate=
ly<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different way from what we have today.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Transactions do not exist today that I know of, although=
 we see<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; signs of them in discussions about the fact that this opti=
ons destroys<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that back end but that option does not.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; We have a &#39;transaction&#39; QMP command, but they are not =
an integral part<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the language. Considering the trouble to implement transact=
ional<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; commands, I suppose we don&#39;t even want it to be a fundamen=
tal part of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the language.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it actually provide more functionality, though?<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It=E2=80=99s not intended to provide more, but to require =
less to do the same thing.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Though we always need to keep in mind that if requiring less f=
or future<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; additions requires a huge effort now, the investment may pay o=
ff only in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a very distant future (if the abstraction we build even surviv=
es until<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; then).<br>

<br>
It&#39;s been a tough lesson for me, too.<br>
