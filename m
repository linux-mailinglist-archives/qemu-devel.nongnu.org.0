Actually, my question is what we gain by increasing in_flight only for
the top level. It feels wrong to me, though maybe it doesn't actually
lead to bugs because in practice, we completely drain the parents
instead of just draining requests going to one specific child.

But as this patch shows, not increasing in_flight in some cases is a lot
more work than doing it, and it's harder to understand why it's correct.
So why not simply increase it unconditionally?

This is how other requests work as well. If you make a read request to a
qcow2 image, you'll get in_flight increased for both the qcow2 node and
the file-posix node.
