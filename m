I don't think pc_memory_pre_plug() should rely on what hotplug_handler_pre_plug()
checks or does. Similarly the later is taking care of whatever piix4 needs to care
and shouldn't care about what machine code does.

Moreover when hotplug_handler_pre_plug() starts to reserve resources, then
if you move check as suggested you'd need to rollback all that
hotplug_handler_pre_plug() done to gracefully abort hotplug.

So I'd leave the code as it is now, since it doesn't depend on concrete
hotplug_handler_pre_plug() implementation and won't break if
hotplug_handler_pre_plug() will start consuming resources (which could
happen and you won't even notice it since changed code is in piix4/q35
files when reviewing patches).
