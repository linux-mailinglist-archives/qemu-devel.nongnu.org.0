Can you please elaborate of what exactly has been backported and the

Which Wayland compositor do you use?

It's worth noting that the xwayland patches in themselves won't make a
difference *unless* the Wayland compositor implements the corresponding
protocol, and I am aware of none for now (the patch for mutter is still
pending).

Ubuntu doesn't have any compositor change, it's standard GNOME 3.24 so
there is must be something wrong and it does make a difference without
implementing the protocole.

Note that reverting 0a448d133 does fix the issue

Test patch

Can you try the attached patch (this is for testing purpose *only*) and
report back if that makes any difference?

With this patch, if the compositor has no support for Xwayland keyboard
grab protocol as you said you haven't in Ubuntu, Xwayland won't set up
its grab handler at all.

Well, what this patch does is disabling any specific grab handler if the
Xwayland grab protocol is not available, by postponing the setup of
those handler until Xwayland can bind to the relevant interface as
advertised by the compositor.

If the compositor doesn't support the Xwayland grab protocol, then all
those routines are not "enabled" in Xwayland, I don't see how they could
break anything if not used...

Unfortunately, we cannot tell whether or not the compositor supports the
Xwayland grab protocol using something like weston-info because, for
security reasons, the compositor will (should) only advertiset he given
protocl to Xwayland alone and hide it to any other client.

So, if that patch makes no difference, it means that:

 - The Wayland compositor claim to support Xwayland grab protocol but is
buggy and doesn't send all key events as expected

 - Or the problem is completely unrelated to this patch.

So next step for you is to:

 - Check the actual patches applied to mutter in Ubuntu
 - Check what happens at the protocol level

To do so, yo can use the envvar WAYLAND_DEBUG prior to start gnome-shell
(which will spawn Xwayland) so that we can tell what globals are listed
in the wl_registry and see if "zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1" is
one of them.

e.g., from a console:

  $ WAYLAND_DEBUG=3D1 dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --display-server
--wayland |& tee ~/wayland-debug.log

The wl_registry globals will be listed at the beginning of the log so
that should be enough to tell if the compositor claims to be supporting
"zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1".

Then, you can start qemu-kvm as usual and try to press the keys that do
not work, those will be captured in the log as well, so we can tell if
the compositor sends those key events to the client (Xwayland, in which
case the problem lies in Xwayland) or not (in which case the problem
lies in the compositor).

Please attach the "wayland-debug.log" to this bugzilla once you've
performed those tests (but make sure you don't type any sensitive data
in any application while the log is being captured as any key event will
be logged).

Title:
  qemu can't capture keys properly under wayland

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in XServer:
  Unknown
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Confirmed
Status in xorg-server package in Ubuntu:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  This appears to be different than the previous similar bugs; patches
  do look to be applied to use libinput in the wayland case. Still:

  unknown keycodes `(unnamed)', please report to qemu-devel@nongnu.org

  I am using qemu-system-x86                       1:2.10+dfsg-0ubuntu1
  on artful.

  Many key inputs work correctly, but at boot the system will not
  properly catch the arrow keys, the above error shows up immediately
  after hitting Esc (for instance) to get to the boot menu. Booting from
  CD onto a daily Ubuntu desktop image, I can't navigate the splash
  menu.

  The same works correctly through virt-manager (which uses spice
  AFAICT, but wayland tends to crash when running virt-manager), and
  things work if I switch my session to Xorg rather than wayland.
