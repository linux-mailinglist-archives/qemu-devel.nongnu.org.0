Well its feature list is defined by what exists in QEMU code right
now. Presumably was based off some silicon that did exist in Intel
at some point, or it would not have been added to QEMU in the first
place ?

Changing guests to use "-cpu Icelake-Server,+/-" would be a guest
ABI change because of the different model number IIUC

We have versioned CPU models so that we can fix mistakes in previously
defined CPU model features, without causing breakage for anything that
is using the previous incorrectly defined model.  We can't version the
deletion of a CPU model though. I'm not seeing the serious harm that's
caused by the Icelake-Client CPU model existing though, and deleting
it will definitely cause harm to the config of anything that currently
happens to use it.

Maybe Icelake-Client could be turned into a deprecated alias for a
version of Icelake-Server that has  the cutdown feature list ?

Daniel
