write-blocking promises that the guest receives request completion only
when the request has also been written to the target. If you completely
skip the write, this promise is broken.

So I think you'd have to keep the write and only align the range for the
purpose of clearing bits in the dirty bitmap. This would result in some
duplicated I/O, which is an efficiency problem, but at least it
shouldn't come with a correctness problem.
