That's a great idea! :)

Now, seriously, I also resisted this for quite a long time.  The
reality, though, is that intermittent failures will continue to
appear, and letting tests (and jobs, and CI pipelines, and whatnot)
fail is a very bad idea.  We all agree that real fixes are better than
this, but many times they don't come quickly.

And here you have a key point that I absolutely agree with.  The
"flaky" approach can either poison a lot of tests, and be seen as
quick way out of a difficult issue revealed by a test.  Or, it can
serve as an effective tool to keep track of these very important
issues.

If we add:

   # https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1829779
   :avocado: flaky

Topped with some human, I believe this can be very effective.  This goes
without saying, but comments here are very much welcome.
