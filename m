I'm starting to understand Zoltan point. What I'm seeing is Zoltan using
a hobbyist code, that just happens to work for hobbyists, but get in the
way of enterprise quality standards.

Zoltan doesn't have the skills/time/motivation to rework its working
code to meet the enterprise quality level. Enterprise developers tried
to understand twice (first Igor, then Markus) the hobbyist use to get
it done safer, so it can stay maintained.

Zoltan, I guess I understood your use and have an idea to rework it in
a way that everybody is happy, but as Markus said, since the freeze is
next week, I won't have time to get it done in this short amount of
time.

From the PPC460EX-NUB800T-AMCC-datasheet-11553412.pdf datasheet I
understand the 460EX can support "Up to 8 GB in four external banks",
but the SAM 460ex board only wires a single bank (to the SODIMM
connector). You want to use a virtual board with up-to 4 banks in
use, right?
