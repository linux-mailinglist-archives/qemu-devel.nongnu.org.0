Ah, that nicely explains why it worked just fine for me.  First, I have
a local proxy configured so the installer isn't going to connect to
ftp.NetBSD.org directly.  Second I have IPv6 connectivity.

Both I'd say ...

First, by default slirp should not send IPv6 router announcements
to the user network if the host has no IPv6 connectivity.

Second, the recommended way to connect is to try ipv4 and ipv6 in
parallel, then use whatever connects first.  Web browsers typically
do it that way.  wget and curl don't do that though, they try one
address after the other, and I guess this is where the delay comes
from ...

cheers,
  Gerd
