I'd add a note for users who wish to fix existing images (and I need
to add it to libvirt's knowledge base too) that when the user is unsure
of the backing image format and desn't trust that the image was handled
in a trusted way, they must not use the format detected by qemu-img info
if the image specifies a backing file, unless they also trust the
backing file. (Sorry as a non-native English speaker I can't express
this in a more elegant way.).

Isn't this a similar instance to what I've reported in the previous
version? You warn that the format is missing, but set out_basefmt to the
detected format , thus bdrv_change_backing_file will then write the
detected format into the overlay even when it previously did not?

I think this has to have the same check for raw-only as above.

or just the above line.

I feel that this deprecation will be at least partially controversial,
but in my opinion it's the correct thing to do.
