Nice!

I am sure it was connected somehow, anyway, I am glad we can continue

[Adding DanielÂ  and Michal]
Is there anyway to test live-migration for libvirt domains on the same host?
Even a 'hack' would be enough.

Sukrit, another way you could do it is by enabling nested virtualization
and have 2 Vms as hosts. I suppose the migration will take some time 
though...


Thanks,
Marcel
