That's correct. In the end it's just a matter of how many devices do you 
expect to be exposed with the same 9p export for choosing an appropriate value 
for k. That parameter k must be constant at least until guest is rebooted, 
otherwise you would end up with completely different inode numbers if you 
would change that parameter k while guest is still running.

Like I mentioned before, I can send a short C file if you want to play around 
with that parameter k to see how the generated suffixes would look like. The 
console output is actually like shown above. Additionally the C demo also 
checks and proofs that all generated suffixes really generate unique numbers for 
the entire possible 64 bit range, so that should take away the scare about 
what this algorithm does.

Since you said before that you find it already exotic to have more than 1 
device being exported by 9p, I hence did not even bother to make that 
parameter "k" a runtime parameter. I *think* k=0 should be fine in practice.

I just did that to provide a direct comparison between the fixed size prefix vs. 
variable size suffix code, since the fixed size prefix code is easier to 
understand.

If you want I can add a 6th "cleanup" patch that would remove the fixed size 
prefix code and all the #ifs ?

Well, the goal in general is too keep the generated suffix numbers (or their bit 
count actually) as small as possible, because you are cutting away the same 
amount of bits of the orginal inode number from host. So the smaller the 
generated suffix number is, the more bits you can simply directly use from the 
original inode number from host, and hence the cheaper this remap code becomes 
in practice. Because if you have e.g. a suffix number of just 3 bits, then in 
practice you will very likely only have exactly 1 entry in that hash table 
*ever*. So hash lookup will be very cheap, etc.

If you had a suffix number of 32 bit instead that would mean you would need to 
cut away 32 bits from the original inode numbers, and hence you would likely 
end up with multiple entries in the hash table and the remap code becomes more 
expensive due to the hash table lookups, and even worse, you might even end up 
getting into that "full map" code which generates a hash entry for every next 
inode.

In practice this issue becomes probably more relevant when nested 
virtualization becomes more popular OR if you are using a large number of 
devices on the same export.

I don't think the compiler's optimizer would really drop all the instructions 
automatically of the generalized variant of that particular function. Does it 
matter in practice? No, I actually just provided that optimized variant for 
the special case k=0 because I think k=0 will be the default value for that 
parameter and because you were already picky about a simple

	if (pdu->s->dev_id == 0)

to be optimized. In practice users won't feel the runtime difference either 
one of the two optimization scenarios.

Because I found the entire function comment block became already too verbose 
and that particular sentence to be not relevant. At least IMO.
