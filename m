OK, given all info you presented in last paragraphs and elsewhere - that
seems to have more emphasis on potential adjustments, and the obligatory
condition that nothing breaks - I agree with the approach you spelled out,
or, in other words, agree with introducing deprecation note.

I hope that we all perceive occasional differences in opinions as our value
(and, I even claim, a key to success of any dev community), and not a
nuisance or a danger.

Thanks! :)

Regards,
Aleksandar
