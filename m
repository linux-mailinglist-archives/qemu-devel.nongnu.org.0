It should report 1 to indicate its data for one pfn.

No.
Here 'I' means User application, right?
User application knows for how many pfns bitmap he had already received,
i.e. see 'count' in function vfio_get_dirty_page_list().

Here copied_pfns is the number of pfns for which bitmap is available in
buffer. Start address for that bitmap is then calculated by user
application as :
((start_pfn + count) * page_size)

Then QEMU calls:

cpu_physical_memory_set_dirty_lebitmap((unsigned long *)buf,
                                       (start_pfn + count) * page_size,
                                        copied_pfns);

Hope above explanation helps.

It should return 0.

Who should fault, vendor driver or user application?

Here Vendor driver is writing data to data section.
In the steps in this patch-set, user application is incrementing
start_pfn by adding copied_pfn count.

We introduced data_offset not to have such assumption, better not to
keep such assumption at some place.
