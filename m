pthread_key destructors are a disaster waiting to happen with
dlclose, if the dlclose happens while non-main threads are
still running. When those threads exit, they'll run the
destructor which points to a function that is no longer
resident in memory.

IOW if you have destrutors, then you need to make sure your
library uses "-z nodelete" when linking, to turn dlclose()
into a no-op.

    Prevent crash from dlclose() of libvirt.so
    
    When libvirt calls virInitialize it creates a thread local
    for the virErrorPtr storage, and registers a callback to
    cleanup memory when a thread exits. When libvirt is dlclose()d
    or otherwise made non-resident, the callback function is
    removed from memory, but the thread local may still exist
    and if a thread later exists, it will invoke the callback
    and SEGV. There may also be other thread locals with callbacks
    pointing to libvirt code, so it is in general never safe to
    unload libvirt.so from memory once initialized.
    
    To allow dlclose() to succeed, but keep libvirt.so resident
    in memory, link with '-z nodelete'. This issue was first
    found with the libvirt CIM provider, but can potentially
    hit many of the dynamic language bindings which all ultimately
    involve dlopen() in some way, either on libvirt.so itself,
    or on the glue code for the binding which in turns links
    to libvirt

Daniel
