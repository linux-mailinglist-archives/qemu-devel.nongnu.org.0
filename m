This is not the approach described in this document. The point of this
approach is precisely that migration is known to be safe when the device
model URI and configuration parameters match on source and destination.

Changes to the guest-visible hardware interface and/or device state
representation always require a new configuration parameter under this
approach.

That is not possible under this approach.

The version string is not directly part of the migration compatibility
check under this approach. It's is simply an alias for a list of
configuration parameters.
