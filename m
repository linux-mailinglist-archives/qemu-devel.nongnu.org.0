There's nothing that prevents a
  void object_class_add_properties(oc, Property *props);
function from supporting both.

Yes, but I don't expect this to happen if the API doesn't
encourage that.

Property with struct field:

  /* We call this DEFINE_PROP_UINT32 today.  We can keep the
   * existing name just to reduce churn.
   */
  DEFINE_PROP_UINT32_FIELD("myproperty", MyState, my_field)


Prop with struct field but custom setter:

  DEFINE_PROP_UINT32_FIELD("myproperty", MyState, my_field,
                           .custom_setter = my_custom_setter)

Prop with no struct field, and custom setter/getter:

  DEFINE_PROP("myproperty", prop_type_uint32,
              .custom_getter = my_getter,
              .custom_setter = my_setter)


Definitions for above:

#define DEFINE_PROP(_name, _typeinfo, ...) \
    { .name = _name,
      .info = &_typeinfo,
      __VA_ARGS__
    }

#define DEFINE_FIELD_PROP(name, typeinfo, type, state, field, ...) \
    DEFINE_PROP(name, typeinfo,
                .offset = offsetof(state, field) +
                          type_check(typeof_field(state, field), type),
                __VA_ARGS__)

#define DEFINE_PROP_UINT32_FIELD(name, state, field, ...) \
    DEFINE_FIELD_PROP(name, prop_type_uint32, uint32_t, state, field, __VA_ARGS__)


Alternative DEFINE_FIELD_PROP definition if we implement some
macro magic to declare the expected type for each typeinfo
variable:

/* Will make ACTUAL_C_TYPE(prop_type_uint32) expand to uint32_t */
DECLARE_QOM_TYPE(prop_type_uint32, uint32_t)
/* Will make ACTUAL_C_TYPE(prop_type_uint64) expand to uint64_t) 
DECLARE_QOM_TYPE(prop_type_uint64, uint64_t)

#define DEFINE_FIELD_PROP(name, typeinfo, state, field, ...) \
    DEFINE_PROP(name, typeinfo,
                .offset = offsetof(state, field) +
                          type_check(typeof_field(state, field),
                                     ACTUAL_C_TYPE(typeinfo)),
                __VA_ARGS__)

We can, but I believe it is better and simpler to have an API
that enforces (or at least encourages) this.

instance-level properties are where most of the complexity was
introduced because the class API didn't exist yet.  I don't think
we should ignore them, or we risk having the same issues when
converting them to class properties.

I'd like us to convert instance-level properties to an API that
is easy to use and where the same problems won't happen again.

Possibly the most complex case is x86_cpu_register_bit_prop().
The qdev_property_add_static() calls at arm_cpu_post_init() are
tricky too.

If object*_property_add*() is hidden behind a function call or a
`if` statement, it's already too much complexity to me.  I don't
want us to need a second audit like the one John made when we
decide to represent QOM class properties in a QAPI schema.
