Well, that works reasonable well.  It looks at all pci bars.  The ones
which do not belong to PCI0 are added to their pci(e) expander.  All
remaining address space of the pci hole is added to PCI0.  At times
things look a bit odd as all unused ranges go to PCI0 even in cases like
this one:

[ ... ]
84a00000-85203fff : PCI Bus 0000:40
  84a00000-84bfffff : PCI Bus 0000:44
  84c00000-84dfffff : PCI Bus 0000:43
  84e00000-84ffffff : PCI Bus 0000:42
  85000000-851fffff : PCI Bus 0000:41
  85200000-85200fff : 0000:40:02.3
  85201000-85201fff : 0000:40:02.2
  85202000-85202fff : 0000:40:02.1
  85203000-85203fff : 0000:40:02.0
85204000-853fffff : PCI Bus 0000:00   <<-- this could be given to PCI Bus 0000:40
85400000-85c03fff : PCI Bus 0000:80
  85400000-855fffff : PCI Bus 0000:84
[ ... ]

but that is more or less cosmetical.

Basically qemu assumes the (32bit) pci hole starts above the mmconfig
bar.  The pci hole should start above low memory though, like it does
on 'pc'.  And the mmconfig bar should be excluded.
