I seem to recall it comes down to the various approaches that FPUs can
take when dealing with tiny numbers when rounding. Emilio did the
original work so I've CC'd him. The original paper is referenced in the
hardfloat commentary:

 Guo, Yu-Chuan, et al. "Translating the ARM Neon and VFP instructions in a
 binary translator." Software: Practice and Experience 46.12 (2016):1591-16=
15.

which is worth a read if you can get hold of it.

Running tests on start up is not without precedent. We have a
softfloat_init which checks for a broken FMA implementation. However I'd
caution about adding too many checks in there.

We already enable hardfloat for all hosts apart from PPC and FAST_MATHS.

Thanks for the clarification.

You could go further if you know nothing in a block can fault you can
skip the calculation overhead of the per-op flags for all but the last
op in the block.

Well for all apart from inexact handling (which would fault as soon as
set) all other exception types are detected before we pass them to
hardfloat anyway. Given the range of NaN types we would have to post
process and hardfloat operation anyway to give the right NaN.
