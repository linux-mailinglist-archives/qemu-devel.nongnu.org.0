I'm wary of complicating the build system to save developers a minor
change of habits.

We will have to ask developers to change habits anyway when we switch to
Meson.  I agree with Daniel's recommendation to delay changes requiring
habit-changes until then.  However, telling people to stay clear of the
unloved and brittle in-tree build is simply good advice we should not
withhold.  When you can't make the obvious way to do things the way that
has the best chance of actually working, at least have the courtesy to
point people to the way that has the best chance of actually working.

If some developers want to avoid a change of habits badly enough, surely
one or more of them will volunteer to contribute / maintain the
complications needed for that with Meson.

Whatever it takes to get rid of in-tree-only build breakages :)
