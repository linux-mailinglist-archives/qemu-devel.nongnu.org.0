Yes, query-cpu-model-expansion returns additional information, so
it depends on what exactly you are looking for.

If you want to know which properties a given QEMU binary supports
in the command-line, `device-list-properties` is supposed to be
enough.  If you need to know which properties can be really
enabled in a given host (based on QEMU+KVM+hardware
capabilities), you'll need `query-cpu-model-expansion model=max`.
