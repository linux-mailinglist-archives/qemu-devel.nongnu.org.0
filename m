Update Marc's email address.

+cc Gavin as he is posting a RFC for ARM NMI.

Hi Marc,

Really sorry for missing to update your email address, for the initial=20
topic was raised long time ago and I forgot to update the Cc list in the=20
commit message of the patches.

Thanks Gavin for forwarding current discussion on ARM NMI to me.

For you said SDEI is "horrible", does it mean we'd better never=20
implement SDEI in virtual world? Or do you have any advice on how to=20
implement it?

Thanks,

Heyi
