I'm pretty sure RHV/oVirt+vdsm has implemented it and it is even being=20
used in production. Of course it requires a bond/team device to be=20
configured in the guest OS, but the part about auto-detaching the VF=20
before migration, then reattaching a similar VF on the destination is=20
all done by vdsm. (Don't misunderstand this as discouraging this new=20
method! Just wanted to set the record straight.)
