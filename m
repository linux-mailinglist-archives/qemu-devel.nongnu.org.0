One problem we have in the codebase I think is just an overabundance of cpu.c, cpu.h,
and functions called cpu_some_thing(), so it is hard to understand what is what.

"cpus" is at least different, and (if you know of course) it points you to a specific module.

We could look for another module name to match more what is inside, however I did keep it on purpose,
considering that cpus.h, cpus.c offers functionality to run on _all_ cpus, fe:

list_cpus,
cpu_synchronize_all_states,
cpu_synchronize_all_post_reset,
cpu_synchronize_all_post_init,
cpu_synchronize_all_pre_loadvm,
pause_all_vcpus,
resume_all_vcpus,
vm_prepare_start,
vm_start,
vm_shutdown


I agree with the sentiment that the current situation of modules, names, functions they contain and headers is confusing,
however here I would stay with the (imperfect) cpus.c module name, but maybe there are other opinions we can collect on a possible alternative.

Perhaps, I don't really know.

What I would like to convey here clearly is that the file contains the
implementation for kvm of the cpus accel interface.

I guess kvm-cpus-interface-impl.c would be more "correct"?

Maybe just kvm-cpus.c or kvm-[whatever name we replace the name "cpus.c" with]?

Does it? It seems to me AccelClass and AccelState is used a bit all over the place.

> for accel CPU registration? I don't know but may be generic the leftover

I had a comment in the RFCv2 thread about this, since it's the first thing I tried:

"
NB: here I _really_ wanted to make AccelClass more useful and add methods to it.

In practice though, accessing the methods becomes clunky and expensive with lots of indirections from cpus.c

(current_accel() call, -> accelerator, ACCEL_GET_CLASS(), -> AccelCpusInterface -> method);

In my first attempt I ended up with a cache of the interface in cpus.c ,
and at that point the usefulness of having the methods at all in AccelClass becomes nil, so that resulted in the cpus accel interface being disjointed from AccelClass.
"

However I guess the question is, are we ok to increase substantially the cost of each vcpu kick and sync state for all archs?

I would prefer to err on the side of caution and reduce the overhead increase, although making more use of AccelClass would be "nicer",
maybe there are more opinions to collect here as well, or some experience on the hotness of the kick and sync_state code paths for all archs?

cpus.c does not seem to belong to accel/

It is fine too, for the "CPUAccel" name, I think it would depend on a couple of other things pending resolution above
(but I think it is fine in principle).

here the problem is again that there are a lot of functions called kick_cpu_something, kick_vcpu_something or various permutations.

Having modulename_function would help in this case I think.

There is precedent in qemu, and would actually like to see more of it, as it makes things way easier to understand and disambiguate, but maybe it's just my thing?

I could push for even more consistency in this regard in cpus.c and elsewhere (I have balanced this desire with the need to also not change too much, too quickly).

Just let me know what the best course of action is, I thought I reproduced here the existing behavior?

(remember that the code that cpus_kick_thread now consists of _was_ executed before for hvf, in the form of qemu_cpu_kick_thread)

If we need some changes to the existing behavior, should we do it after this so we don't mix refactoring with functional change?

throughout the code it is "start" for all accelerators, that is probably why "start" was used here as well.
The only exception being TCG, which had "init".

Sorry I don't follow, you mentioned before that it seems to work, but now that it fails?

Does this have anything to do with the TODO in the current code in cpus.c:

void cpu_synchronize_all_states(void)
{
    CPUState *cpu;

    CPU_FOREACH(cpu) {
        cpu_synchronize_state(cpu);
        /* TODO: move to cpu_synchronize_state() */
        if (hvf_enabled()) {
            hvf_cpu_synchronize_state(cpu);
        }
    }
}

?

Ciao and thanks for the comments, really appreciated!
