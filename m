Aha - I figured out my problem: I have to apply John's pull request, but=20
not my configure patch, to reproduce the build failure that Peter hit.=20
And with that, I can now state that this patch HAS been fully-tested by=20
me (but giving Tested-by: to my own patch feels weird):

make docker-test-clang@ubuntu1804 TARGETS=3Dx86_64

on the following matrix:

   John's PR =3D>         excluded included
my patch excluded         pass    fail
my patch included         pass    pass

Looks like the next step is for John to send v2 of the pull request with=20
my configure patch inserted.
