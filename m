I'm not sure what you mean by "support". We wouldn't have to support it
any more than qmp-shell in the initial phase. It wouldn't even have to
be any less hidden.

And in fact, even in the long run, as it is meant for human use, the
compatibility promise (if this is what you mean) would be the same as
HMP - we change it whenever we think that this improves its usability
for humans.

There is a big difference between making qmp-shell more usable and
promoting it to prime-time.

I think some amount of sugar will actually be necessary. We don't want
to have something that barely works, but something that people would
actually prefer to HMP.

I would start with "Creating something that could eventually evolve into
something that makes HMP useless".

I don't know either. I can tell you when I see the alternative. Having
the alternative implemented as an external script allows for some
experimentation without fully committing to it yet. qmp-shell has lived
for a long time in the tree without replacing HMP, so if we just end up
with a more usable qmp-shell that still doesn't replace HMP, I would
still see it as progress.

I think the former would be a subset of the latter, so starting with the
former shouldn't result in wasted work.

Personally, I like the idea of supporting some extras to perform high
level operations that QMP doesn't provide. I don't like the idea of
prefixing the extras with "?" to make them second-class commands.
Instead of having "?info block", I think "query-block" should be able to
print something readable by default and switching it to raw JSON would
be optional.

Possibly.

What else would it be?

I think so. QMP-compatible basically just means that we need to be able
to distinguish QTypes (where the schema doesn't already disambiguate)
and to allow nesting.

> - Do we like the existing syntax? (I assume we do not.)

It makes sense for scalar options, so I think we'll want to keep these
cases working. We'll probably want something different for lists and
dicts.

Compared to HMP, a difference is that qmp-shell always requires you to
specify the option name. Introducing "positional arguments" like in HMP
could probably make things considerably easier to use.

I think we should keep removing HMP completely out of this discussion.
If at some point we agree that qmp-shell has been improved to the extent
that none of us use HMP any more anyway, that's probably the point when
we should talk about removing HMP.

Let's just talk about improving qmp-shell for now.

Yes, even if we have human-oriented output for a command, there should
always be a way to see the raw JSON. And probably also a way to send raw
JSON.

That's a good way to phrase it.

We should have a rough idea, but I don't think we need to know exactly
what the final state will look like. Let's keep some room for
experimentation. And even if we now implement something that turns out a
less than optional decision later, we can still change it. It's a human
interface, we don't have to be careful with respect to compatibility.
