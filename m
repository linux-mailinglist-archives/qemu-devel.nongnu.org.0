I created a file with 2G on my disk.

#ll -h 2G-file
-rw-r--r-- 1 richard richard 2.0G 6æœˆ  26 09:26 2G-file

The command line is changed to:

    -object memory-backend-file,id=mem1,share,mem-path=/home/richard/guest/2G-file,size=2G 
    -device virtio-pmem-pci,memdev=mem1,id=nv1

The behavior in guest is the same.

I took a look into the directory /sys/bus/nd/device. These files are listed.
Compared with normal system, one device file is missed.

btt0.0  dax0.0  namespace0.0  ndbus0  pfn0.0  region0

But the sysfs shows pmem0 block device is created.

/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:04.0/virtio0/ndbus0/region0/namespace0.0/block/pmem0

Then I took a look into the pci device:

# lspci -vs 00:04.0
00:04.0 Unclassified device [00ff]: Red Hat, Inc. Device 1013
	Subsystem: Red Hat, Inc. Device 001b
	Physical Slot: 4
	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11
	I/O ports at c040 [size=64]
	Memory at fe000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=16K]
	Capabilities: [84] Vendor Specific Information: VirtIO: <unknown>
	Capabilities: [70] Vendor Specific Information: VirtIO: Notify
	Capabilities: [60] Vendor Specific Information: VirtIO: DeviceCfg
	Capabilities: [50] Vendor Specific Information: VirtIO: ISR
	Capabilities: [40] Vendor Specific Information: VirtIO: CommonCfg
	Kernel driver in use: virtio-pci

This looks good.

This log still there.
