Right. I'd also like to point out that I carried out some additional experi=
ments using variations of the program in the issue description, with bizarr=
e results, mips64. I changed the value of the pointer to 0x7f7df38c0000 to =
increase the alignment a bit and then did the following experiments:
1) shmat(id, 0x7f7df38c0000, 0) fails, returning 0xffffffffffffffff, errno =
=3D=3D 22 (EINVAL)
2) shmat(id, 0x7f7df38c0000, SHM_REMAP) fails, returning 0xffffffffffffffff=
, errno =3D=3D 22 (EINVAL)
3) shmat(id, 0x7f7df38c0000, SHM_RND) succeeds. Additionally, the return va=
lue is exactly the pointer value passed to the host shmat(), that is, 0x7f7=
df38c0000.

The following thing bothers me:
With flags set to 0, the address 0x7f7df38c0000 is rejected. This could hav=
e been an alignment problem, but the call actually succeeds when the flags =
are set to SHM_RND (to align the returned address properly), with the point=
er value remaining the same.

This looks bizarre to me, no matter the way you look at it.

Title:
  shmat fails on 32-to-64 setup

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  =

  I am trying to run a guest mips32 program (user mode) on a x86_64 host. T=
he program fails on a call to shmat() reproducibly. when digging into this =
problem, I could make a small guest POC that fails when compiled as i386 (-=
m32) running on a x86_64 host, but pass when compiled as 64bit. The problem=
 has to do with mmap flags.

  From what I can understand, when running 32bits guests programs, qemu
  reserve the whole guest virtual space with an mmap call. That mmap
  call specifys MAP:PRIVATE flag. When shmat is called, it tries to make
  part of that region MAP_SHARED and that fails.

  As a possible fix, it looks like it is possible to first unmap the shm
  region before calling shmat.

  steps to reproduce: =

  1 - create a file shm.c with content below
  2 - compile with: gcc -m32 shm.c -o shm32
  3 - run on a x86_64 host: qemu-i386 ./shm32 =

  4 - observe shmat fails, by returning ptr -1

  5- compile without -m32: : gcc shm.c -o shm64
  6 - observe it pass: qemu-x84_64 ./shm64


  #include <sys/ipc.h>
  #include <sys/shm.h>
  #include <sys/mman.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main()
  {
      struct shmid_ds shm_desc;
      int err =3D 0;
      int id =3D shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 688128, IPC_CREAT|IPC_EXCL|0666);
      err =3D shmctl(id, IPC_STAT, &shm_desc);
      const void *at =3D 0x7f7df38ea000;
      void* ptr =3D shmat(id, at, 0);
      printf( "got err %d, ptr %p\n", err, ptr );
  }
