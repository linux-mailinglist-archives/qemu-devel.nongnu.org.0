I mean both command line and QMP.

This is true, but is it desirable?  Aren't we just moving
complexity elsewhere?  Management software would still need to
translate CPU models from existing VM configurations to QOM type
names.

Removing the code might be trivial.  Coordinating with the
maintainers of all architectures to confirm this is really
something everybody wants is the difficult part.

If you really want to do it, please make sure all the
architecture maintainers (and libvirt developers) are involved in
the discussion.
