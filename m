Yes.  First of all, it=E2=80=99s simply not how it should be.  It=E2=80=99=
s ugly.

Second, it does produce tangible problems.  One thing that comes to mind
is that we only need BB.disable_request_queuing because these
BlockBackends do not have a clear connection to the block job, which
means that the job may want to perform requests on drained BBs.

If source and target were children of the filter node, draining them
would first drain the job, and only then would they be marked as
quiesced, thus solving the problem (as far as I remember).

Good, I was just asking because duplicated fields may be difficult to
keep in sync and so on.

Hm, OK, and the backup job takes care of that through
child_job_set_aio_ctx() in blockjob.c.

But it should still be noted that on master, if you try to move e.g. the
source to a new context (by attaching a device to it), this happens:

qemu-system-x86_64: Cannot change iothread of active block backend

This comes from blk_root_can_set_aio_ctx(); but at the same time, it
will happily allow the context change if blk->allow_aio_context_change
is set =E2=80=93 which is precisely what you do here.

So with this patch, the change is allowed; but the target is moved to
the new context, too.

So it should be noted that this is a change in behavior.  (Well, at
least I wanted to note it here.)

> I'll add a comment on this here.

By the way, this is another problem that we wouldn=E2=80=99t have if sour=
ce and
target were BdrvChildren of backup-top.

(The problem being that the BBs=E2=80=99 contexts are kept in sync indire=
ctly
through the node list attached to the job.)
