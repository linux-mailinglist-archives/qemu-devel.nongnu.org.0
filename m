The restriction is there; but it's not related to the memory saving;
savevm mostly uses the core migration code (which would normally run in
a separate thread) but uses it itself in it's own loop in the main
thread with a bunch of bdrv code glued around it to do the snapshots
there.=20
It shouldn't be that hard to convert it to be much more like a normal
migration - except it needs some hook then to do the snapshotting stuff
at the end.
