A fast pre-zeroing pass is faster than writing explicit zeroes.  If such 
a fast pass works, then you can avoid further I/O for all subsequent 
zero sections; the unallocated sections will now happen to read as zero, 
but that is not a problem since the content of unallocated portions is 
not guaranteed.

But if pre-zeroing is not fast, then you have to spend the extra I/O to 
explicitly zero the portions that are allocated but read as zero, while 
still skipping the unallocated portions.

But that can be slower, when pre-zeroing is fast.  "Unallocated blocks 
need not be written" allows for optimizations, "unallocated blocks must 
not be touched" does not.
