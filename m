The "value" is internally stored in a 64bits unsigned integer.

5) In linux, a clock rate is an "unsigned long" representing Hz.

Then is a maybe a good idea to store the period and not the frequency in
clocks so that we don't loose anything when we switch from a clock to a
ptimer ?

Regarding the clock, I don't see any strong obstacle to switch
internally to a period based value.
The only things we have to choose is how to represent a disabled clock.
Since putting a "0" period to a ptimer will disable the timer in
ptimer_reload(). We can choose that (and it's a good value because we
can multiply or divide it, it stays the same).

We could use the same representation as a ptimer. But if we don't keep a
C number representation, then computation of frequencies/periods will be
complicated at best and error prone.

From that point of view, if we could stick to a 64bits integer (or
floating point number) it would be great. Can we use a sub nanosecond
unit that fit our needs ?

I did some test with a unit of 2^-32 of nanoseconds on 64bits (is that
the unit of the ptimer fractional part ?) and if I'm not mistaken
+ we have a frequency range from ~0.2Hz up to 10^18Hz
+ the resolution is decreasing with the frequency (but at 100Mhz we have
a ~2.3mHz resolution, at 1GHz it's ~0.23Hz and at 10GHz ~23Hz
resolution). We hit 1Hz resolution around 2GHz.

So it sounds to me we have largely enough resolution to model clocks in
the range of frequencies we will have to handle. What do you think ?
