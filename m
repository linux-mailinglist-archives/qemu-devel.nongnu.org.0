I'm currently trying to debug a hang in 'nbdkit nbd' as a client when
TLS is in use, when dealing with three processes:
nbdkit example1[1] <=3Dtls=3D> nbdkit nbd[2] <=3Dplain=3D> qemu-nbd --list[=
3]

In theory, when process [3] exits, the server side of process [2] is
supposed to disconnect as client from process [1].  But we were
hitting sporadic hangs where process [2] was stuck in a poll() while
in gnutls cleanup code, which appears to be because it did not
recognize a clean shutdown from process [3].

I do not yet have a strong reproducible test case (which might include
adding strategic sleep()s in one-off compilations) to prove that the
problem is an unclean TLS shutdown, but at the same time, the gnutls
documentation is clear that without proper use of gnutls_bye(), a
client cannot distinguish between clean end of communications and a
malicious interruption in service.  Shutting down the write side of a
bi-directional socket as soon as possible makes it easier for a client
to begin its own shutdown actions, and can help in avoiding deadlocks
where both sides of a connection are waiting for the other side to
close() the socket first.  If I can come up with a reliable test case,
this series may be a candidate for 5.0; but for now, I'm only
proposing it for 5.1 (we've had more than one release where qemu was
not exploiting the full power of gnutls_bye(), and even if that
triggers poor interaction with other endpoints such as nbdkit, going
one more release with the same behavior isn't making things worse).

  crypto: Add qcrypto_tls_shutdown()
  io: Support shutdown of TLS channel
  nbd: Use shutdown(SHUT_WR) after last item sent
