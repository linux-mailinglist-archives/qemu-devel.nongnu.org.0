 This patch series is ready to be merged via nvdimm tree
 as discussed with Dan. We have ack/review on XFS, EXT4 &
 VIRTIO patches. Need an ack on device mapper change in
 patch 4.

 Mike, Can you please review patch 4 which has change for
 dax with device mapper.

 Incorporated all the changes suggested in v9. This version
 has minor changes in patch 2(virtio) and does not change the=20
 existing functionality, Kept all the existing reviews/ack.
 Jakob CCed also tested the v9 of patch series and confirmed=20
 the working.

 ---

 This patch series has implementation for "virtio pmem".=20
 "virtio pmem" is fake persistent memory(nvdimm) in guest=20
 which allows to bypass the guest page cache. This also
 implements a VIRTIO based asynchronous flush mechanism. =20
=20
 Sharing guest kernel driver in this patchset with the=20
 changes suggested in v4. Tested with Qemu side device=20
 emulation [6] for virtio-pmem. Documented the impact of
 possible page cache side channel attacks with suggested
 countermeasures.

 Details of project idea for 'virtio pmem' flushing interface=20
 is shared [3] & [4].

 Implementation is divided into two parts:
 New virtio pmem guest driver and qemu code changes for new=20
 virtio pmem paravirtualized device.

1. Guest virtio-pmem kernel driver
---------------------------------
   - Reads persistent memory range from paravirt device and=20
     registers with 'nvdimm_bus'. =20
   - 'nvdimm/pmem' driver uses this information to allocate=20
     persistent memory region and setup filesystem operations=20
     to the allocated memory.=20
   - virtio pmem driver implements asynchronous flushing=20
     interface to flush from guest to host.

2. Qemu virtio-pmem device
---------------------------------
   - Creates virtio pmem device and exposes a memory range to=20
     KVM guest.=20
   - At host side this is file backed memory which acts as=20
     persistent memory.=20
   - Qemu side flush uses aio thread pool API's and virtio=20
     for asynchronous guest multi request handling.=20

   David Hildenbrand CCed also posted a modified version[7] of=20
   qemu virtio-pmem code based on updated Qemu memory device API.=20

 Virtio-pmem security implications and countermeasures:
 -----------------------------------------------------

 In previous posting of kernel driver, there was discussion [9]
 on possible implications of page cache side channel attacks with=20
 virtio pmem. After thorough analysis of details of known side=20
 channel attacks, below are the suggestions:

 - Depends entirely on how host backing image file is mapped=20
   into guest address space.=20

 - virtio-pmem device emulation, by default shared mapping is used
   to map host backing file. It is recommended to use separate
   backing file at host side for every guest. This will prevent
   any possibility of executing common code from multiple guests
   and any chance of inferring guest local data based based on=20
   execution time.

 - If backing file is required to be shared among multiple guests=20
   it is recommended to don't support host page cache eviction=20
   commands from the guest driver. This will avoid any possibility
   of inferring guest local data or host data from another guest.=20

 - Proposed device specification [8] for virtio-pmem device with=20
   details of possible security implications and suggested=20
   countermeasures for device emulation.

 Virtio-pmem errors handling:
 ----------------------------------------
  Checked behaviour of virtio-pmem for below types of errors
  Need suggestions on expected behaviour for handling these errors?

  - Hardware Errors: Uncorrectable recoverable Errors:=20
  a] virtio-pmem:=20
    - As per current logic if error page belongs to Qemu process,=20
      host MCE handler isolates(hwpoison) that page and send SIGBUS.=20
      Qemu SIGBUS handler injects exception to KVM guest.=20
    - KVM guest then isolates the page and send SIGBUS to guest=20
      userspace process which has mapped the page.=20
 =20
  b] Existing implementation for ACPI pmem driver:=20
    - Handles such errors with MCE notifier and creates a list=20
      of bad blocks. Read/direct access DAX operation return EIO=20
      if accessed memory page fall in bad block list.
    - It also starts backgound scrubbing. =20
    - Similar functionality can be reused in virtio-pmem with MCE=20
      notifier but without scrubbing(no ACPI/ARS)? Need inputs to=20
      confirm if this behaviour is ok or needs any change?
