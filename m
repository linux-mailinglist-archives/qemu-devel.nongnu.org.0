Commit 2d80fbb14df hints at the reason:

    <source type=3D'bridge'> uses a helper application to do the necessary
    TUN/TAP setup to use an existing network bridge, thus letting
    unprivileged users use TUN/TAP interfaces.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code confirms:

    /* qemuInterfaceBridgeConnect:
     * @def: the definition of the VM
     * @driver: qemu driver data
     * @net: pointer to the VM's interface description
     * @tapfd: array of file descriptor return value for the new device
     * @tapfdsize: number of file descriptors in @tapfd
     *
---> * Called *only* called if actualType is VIR_DOMAIN_NET_TYPE_NETWORK or
---> * VIR_DOMAIN_NET_TYPE_BRIDGE (i.e. if the connection is made with a tap
     * device connecting to a bridge device)
     */
    int
    qemuInterfaceBridgeConnect(virDomainDefPtr def,
                               virQEMUDriverPtr driver,
                               virDomainNetDefPtr net,
                               int *tapfd,
                               size_t *tapfdSize)
    {
        [...]
--->    if (virQEMUDriverIsPrivileged(driver)) {
            [...]
        } else {
            if (qemuCreateInBridgePortWithHelper(cfg, brname,
                                                 &net->ifname,
                                                 tapfd, tap_create_flags) <=
 0) {
                virDomainAuditNetDevice(def, net, tunpath, false);
                goto cleanup;
            }
            [...]
        }
        [...]

Objections, anyone?
