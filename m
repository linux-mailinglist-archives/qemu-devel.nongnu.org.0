Agree.

We have source for several separate programs in the root directory
already: qemu-bridge-helper, qemu-edid, qemu-img, qemu-io, qemu-nbd,
qemu-keymap, qemu-seccomp, qemu-ga.  Just a .c file when that suffixes,
else a subdirectory, except for qemu-io, which is two .c files in the
root, plus include/qemu-io.h.  Putting virtiofsd/ there follows
qemu-ga's precedence.

There's also precedence for putting such programs into their subsystem's
sub-directory: fsdev/virtfs-proxy-helper, scsi/pr-manager-helper.
