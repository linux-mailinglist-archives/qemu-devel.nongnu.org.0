The current documentation is fairly terse and not easy to decode
for someone who's not intimately familiar with the inner workings
of timer devices. Expand on it by providing a somewhat verbose
description of what behavior each policy will result in, as seen
from both the guest OS and host point of view.

This information is reported pretty much word by word in

  https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsTime

so I'm hoping I can get the QEMU documentation updated and then just
merge back the changes.

+# lost when, for example, the guest is paused.

+# @discard: throw away the missed ticks and continue with future injection
+#           normally.  The guest OS will see the timer jump ahead by a
+#           potentially quite significant amount all at once, as if the
+#           intervening chunk of time had simply not existed; needless to
+#           say, such a sudden jump can easily confuse a guest OS which is
+#           not specifically prepared to deal with it.  Assuming the guest
+#           OS can deal correctly with the time jump, the time in the gues=
t
