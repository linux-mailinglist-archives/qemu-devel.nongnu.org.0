Correct. Maybe I can tweak that comment more as part of splitting this
patch into testsuite improvements (highlighting existing shortfalls)
then the actual implementation change (with its corresponding testsuite
tweaks to demonstrate how it is fixed).

Will do.

We already have one, under the _erange section.  Then again, there's an
oddity: with ERANGE, we tend to leave endptr pointing to the end of what
we did parse, while with EINVAL, we tend to leave endptr pointing to
nptr saying we parsed nothing at all.  It's hard to decide whether -1 is
an ERANGE (negative is not permitted, but we successfully parsed two
characters and so advanced endptr), or an EINVAL (we don't allow
negative at all, so endptr is nptr).  If anyone has preferences, now
would be the time to document the semantics we want; although since we
already have an existing test under _range for -1, I tried to keep that
behavior unchanged.

Won't work nicely.  strtoull() allows for leading whitespace, at which
point we are duplicating a lot of functionality to likewise skip such
leading whitespace before checking the prefix.

True for > 1.0, but false for == 1.0, because of the possibility of
overflow while parsing a fraction like .99999999999999999999999999999999

Not quite.  I used endptr as both input and output in the strtod() call,
so at this point, I'd have to add another variable to track where the
'.' since endptr is no longer pointing there.  But being lazy, I know
that the integral portion contains no 'e', so even though the memchr is
wasting effort searching bytes before the '.' for 'e', it is not wrong.

Agree that we need to support it (well, depending on patch 3, it may be
cleaner to write the test to look for support for 1.5e).  Will make sure
the test covers it.
