We run testing of 64 bit kernel with 64 bit userspace and 32 bit kernel
with 32 bit userspace, we've tested that for years. I know some of our
users do use 64 bit kernels with 32 bit userspace and we do limited
testing of that for multilib support.

I think we did try testing an R2 setup but found little performance
change and I think it may have been unreliable so we didn't make the
switch. We did move to 34kf relatively recently as that did perform
marginally better and matched qemu's recommendations.

We've also run into a lot of problems with 32 bit mips in general if we
go over 256MB memory since that seems to trigger highmem and hangs
regularly for us. We're working on infrastructure to save out those
hung VMs to help us debug such issues but don't have that yet. Its not
regular enough and we don't have the expertise to debug it properly as
yet unfortunately.

There is a question of how valid a 32 bit kernel is these days,
particularly given the memory issues we seem to run into there with
larger images.

Cheers,

Richard
