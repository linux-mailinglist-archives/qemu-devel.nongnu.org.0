I have already tried the change that in your posted patch when I was 
debugging this issue
before sent these fixes, because it may lead double free in some cases, 
and I had mentioned
it in this mail:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/0db486eb-6927-927e-3629-958f8f211194@huawei.com/T/#m68eade1993859dfc6c3d14d35f988d35a32ef837
