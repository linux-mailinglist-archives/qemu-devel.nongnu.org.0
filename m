that will work when there is no -numa on CLI, when -numa is used,
we should use node id that user provided.
like you did in previous revision
   "[PATCH v4 1/3] i386: Simplify CPUID_8000_001E for AMD"

Since there is objection wrt making it error and I'd go with warning for now,
it makes life of person who have to figure what's wrong a bit easier.

With auto_enable_numa it would be cleaner as you can reuse
the same numa code to set 0x8000001e.ecx vs hardcodding it as above.

Maybe post series without auto_enable_numa so we fix migration
regression ASAP and then switch to auto_enable_numa on top.
