I had an initial look at fixing this for arm via 3-phase reset, but ran
into the problem that currently CPU reset is triggered via a
qemu_register_reset() hook, and qemu_register_reset() itself does not
have a 3-phase reset API, so the reset hook for resetting the CPUs will
end up doing all 3 phases of reset for the CPU before the reset hook for
reset-from-sysbus-root does all 3 phases for other devices. (I forget
whether rom-data-copy happens via sysbus reset or is its own
qemu_register_reset hook, but either way the same issue applies.)

One approach to this would be to add 3-phase support to
qemu_register_reset(), I guess.

Title:
  CPU fetch from unpopulated ROM on reset

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Some architectures fetch the $PC/$SP register as vectors in memory, usual=
ly ROM.
  The CPU reset() handler is called before the ROM code is populated, resul=
ting in fetching incorrect PC/SP.

  Architectures affected:
  - M68K
  - RX
  - ARM M-profile
