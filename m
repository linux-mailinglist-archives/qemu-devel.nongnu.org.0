I can imagine how important the average runtime of those checks is to
Howevermergespullreqsnoworinthefuture.  Now, being a bit more selfish
or paranoid, I see the importance of separating those different types
of checks (pre-PR and others) until we achieve a stable environment
for the former.  I do see an extended amount of testing at every
stage as one of the later goals of this effort, but we have to match
that with both computing and human capacity.

In short, I'd suggest keeping them separate *for now*.

Right.  I think this will be an exercise in capacity planning, and
ideally, if there are no resource constraints, all checks could be
performed at all times.

You got me confused here Peter.  Do you intend to reuse the same
machines you're using now (say your work desktop box) or is there an
expectation for different machines to be introduced and used for these
jobs?

Thanks for the feedback,
