This version is mainly a reorganization of v5 patch ordering to make for
more sensible stepwise review and merging. I took the opportunity to add
a few more tests and introduce an overview document.

Changes since v5: Thanks to Michael and Igor for comments.
- Reorganize series to make it more sensible to take in several chunks.
  Includes splitting qtest/cxl-test up so that we have basic testing
  for each stage. Suggested chunks as follows:
  1-15: Infrastructure + host bridge
    At this stage the pxb-cxl host bridge it is presented to the OS
    as a legacy / pcie host bridge.
    This set is close to those Michael Tsirkin suggested picking up
    in v5, but the cxl=on machine parameter was pulled forwards to
    avoid breaking backwards compatibility. It could logically be
    delayed until HB MMIO is introduced but only at cost of then
    failing to instantiate pxb-cxl in cases that would previously
    have 'worked'.
  16-22: Root port, plus CXL type 3 device.
    Will allow Linux cxl-pci driver to bind and present some basic
    features of the type 3 devices.
  23-40: x86 PC support including HB MMIO and CFMWS
    At this region creation and use is possible on x86 platforms.
    Includes a new bios-table-test and more complex qtests/cxl-test
    cases. Includes the interleaving code and an RFC about adding
    ops to memory_region_ram_init_from_file().
  41-42: ARM virt enabling equivalent to that done for x86.
  43: Documentation
    I can break this down if helpful as it includes command line
    examples only possible after support is in place for all elements.
  I've had gitlab CI pipelines testing at patch 15, 22, and 43
  and other than the build-oss-fuzz which is timing out and a false
  positive (I think) in checkpatch they are clean.
  http://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/~/pipelines
  (trivial commit message update followed pushing those out, but
   the code is the same).

- Add a documentation patch as requested by Alex in v4 review.
- Drop the code unification around PCI host bridge setup.
  It will need extensive testing and was only of marginal benefit for this
  series so get it off the critical path.
- Don't build CEDT unless machine parameter cxl=on is set. Tests added
  to exercise the cxl=on case and generate meaningful tables (not empty).
- Move handling of pxb-cxl reset to a later patch where the required
  infrastructure has been created (avoids a crash).
- Split up qtests/cxl-test to build up step by step.
  Introduced an aarch64 test case covering most complex case only as
  this probably sufficient to catch any arch specific problems.
- Introduce test plus bios tables CEDT.cxl and DSDT.cxl.

Updated background info from v5:

Looking in particular for:
* Review of the PCI interactions
* x86 and ARM machine interactions (particularly the memory maps)
* Review of the interleaving approach - is the basic idea
  acceptable?
* Review of the command line interface.
* CXL related review welcome but much of that got reviewed
  in earlier versions and hasn't changed substantially.

Big TODOs:

* Lack of unaligned accesses to interleaved memory. Are there any
  side effects of this restriction?
* Volatile memory devices (easy but it's more code so left for now).
* Switch support. Linux kernel support is under review currently,
  so there is now something to test against.
* Hotplug?  May not need much but it's not tested yet!
* More tests and tighter verification that values written to hardware
  are actually valid - stuff that real hardware would check.
* Testing, testing and more testing.  I have been running a basic
  set of ARM and x86 tests on this, but there is always room for
  more tests and greater automation.
* CFMWS flags as requested by Ben.

Why do we want QEMU emulation of CXL?

As Ben stated in V3, QEMU support has been critical to getting OS
software written given lack of availability of hardware supporting the
latest CXL features (coupled with very high demand for support being
ready in a timely fashion). What has become clear since Ben's v3
is that situation is a continuous one. Whilst we can't talk about
them yet, CXL 3.0 features and OS support have been prototyped on
top of this support and a lot of the ongoing kernel work is being
tested against these patches. The kernel CXL mocking code allows
some forms of testing, but QEMU provides a more versatile and
exensible platform.

Other features on the qemu-list that build on these include PCI-DOE
/CDAT support from the Avery Design team further showing how this
code is useful. Whilst not directly related this is also the test
platform for work on PCI IDE/CMA + related DMTF SPDM as CXL both
utilizes and extends those technologies and is likely to be an early
adopter.
Refs:
CMA Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210804161839.3492053-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/
CMA Qemu: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1624665723-5169-1-git-send-email-cbrowy@avery-design.com/
DOE Qemu: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1623329999-15662-1-git-send-email-cbrowy@avery-design.com/

As can be seen there is non trivial interaction with other areas of
Qemu, particularly PCI and keeping this set up to date is proving
a burden we'd rather do without :)

Ben mentioned a few other good reasons in v3:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210202005948.241655-1-ben.widawsky@intel.com/

What we have here is about what you need for it to be useful for testing
currently kernel code.  Note the kernel code is moving fast so
since v4, some features have been introduced we don't yet support in
QEMU (e.g. use of the PCIe serial number extended capability).

All comments welcome.

Additional info that was here in v5 is now in the documentation patch.

Thanks,

Jonathan
