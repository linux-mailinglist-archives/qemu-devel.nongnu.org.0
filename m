Potentially yes if another approach is satisfying enough, as I wouldn't
want to over-engineer too much around this 9p imposed limitation. The
right thing to do would be to come up with a new version of the protocol
with variable sized QIDs and call it a day.

Maybe, I don't have enough feedback on 9p use cases to have a clear
picture...

Unless I'm missing something, runtime changes would be neglected as well
with the "vii" property since it is static for the device lifetime.

That's a point indeed, even if again I'm not sure if this is a frequent
case to share a directory tree spanning over multiple devices.

I don't have that much time to spend on 9p maintainership, for both
reviewing and fixing bugs (CVEs most of the time). So, yes it may
sound like I want to drop the patchset, but it's just I need to be
convinced I won't regret having merged a huge change like this...
when I'll have to support it alone later ;-)

For the moment, I'm not convinced by the "vii" solution. It even
motivated my suggestion of having several devices actually, since
the paths you would put in there are known before starting QEMU.

It might take me some more rounds of discussion to decide. I understand
it is frustrating but bear with me :)
