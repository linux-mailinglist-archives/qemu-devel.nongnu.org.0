It can create "memory@" or "ibm,dynamic-reconfiguration-memory" nodes but
explicitly rejects all others.

I have tried hacking around to achieve that. Basically calling
spapr_drc_reset() for all DRCs for which spapr_drc_needed()
returns true.

We currently only expose this property for pseries-4.2 and newer
machine types... this could be a problem.

>=20

Ok, I was asking later on if we want to support the scenario of
multiple CAS without an intermediate full reboot. I now have the
answer :)

>=20

>=20

AFAICT the initial value of ov5_cas after a full machine reset is
all zeroes until CAS does:

    /* full range of negotiated ov5 capabilities */
    spapr_ovec_intersect(spapr->ov5_cas, spapr->ov5, ov5_guest);

which is done between:

    ov5_cas_old =3D spapr_ovec_clone(spapr->ov5_cas);

and

    spapr->cas_reboot =3D !spapr_ovec_subset(ov5_cas_old, spapr->ov5_cas);

So I don't quite understand how ov5_cas_old, ie. spapr->ov5_cas at the
time the guest calls CAS, could have an "initial value not entirely
empty"... This can only happen if the guest calls CAS several times
without doing a full reboot in between. My initial thought was to
refuse this scenario and fail any subsequent CAS attempt made by
the guest before a full reboot.

>=20

Same here actually. I was struggling with SLOF to have it create new nodes
for hotplugged-before-CAS devices without crashing :-\

I think I'll wait for your patches to arrive :) Please Cc: me.
