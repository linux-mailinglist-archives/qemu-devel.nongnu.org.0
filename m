I finally found some time to investigate this a little further, yes the
types mentioned are correct for defining start and end of an alias
range.  The challenge here is that these entries require a DeviceID,
which is defined as a BDF, AIUI.  The IVRS is created in QEMU, but bus
numbers are defined by the guest firmware, and potentially redefined by
the guest OS.  This makes it non-trivial to insert a few IVHDs into the
IVRS to describe alias ranges.  I'm wondering if the solution here is
to define a new linker-loader command that would instruct the guest to
write a bus number byte to a given offset for a described device.
These commands would be inserted before the checksum command, such that
these bus number updates are calculated as part of the checksum.

I'm imagining the command format would need to be able to distinguish
between the actual bus number of a described device, the secondary bus
number of the device, and the subordinate bus number of the device.
For describing the device, I'm envisioning stealing from the DMAR
definition, which already includes a bus number invariant mechanism to
describe a device, starting with a segment and root bus, follow a chain
of devfns to get to the target device.  Therefore the guest firmware
would follow the path to the described device, pick the desired bus
number, and write it to the indicated table offset.

Does this seem like a reasonable approach?  Better ideas?  I'm not
thrilled with the increased scope demanded by IVRS support, but so long
as we have an AMD IOMMU model, I don't see how to avoid it.  Thanks,

Alex
