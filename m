Given we require python perhaps the simplest solution would be to re-
write the tap-driver as a python script rather than adding another
configure check?

Title:
  QEMU does not express a dependency on perl-Test-Harness

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  This is a minor thing; in Fedora you can install most of the developer
  dependencies by issuing something like `dnf builddep qemu-kvm` and
  this takes care of just about everything such that you can run
  ./configure and make.

  For "make check" though, configure doesn't catch that you'll need
  perl-Test-Harness; so it fails halfway through the check routine, and
  you'll see this:

  ```
  Can't locate TAP/Parser.pm in @INC (you may need to install the TAP::Pars=
er module) (@INC contains: /usr/local/lib64/perl5 /usr/local/share/perl5 /u=
sr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl /usr/lib64/perl5 /u=
sr/share/perl5) at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./scripts/tap-driver.pl line 30.
  make: *** [/home/jhuston/src/qemu/tests/Makefile.include:905: check-unit]=
 Error 2
  ```

  I'm not sure how we should express this dependency; it shouldn't be a
  requirement for building, but it IS a dependency for testing. We
  probably ought not let users skip the qapi tests just because they
  don't have the perl requirement met.

  (And, separately, the Fedora package should list this as a builddep,
  but that's not an issue for here.)
