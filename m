In general, the NBD protocol has NOT focused on alignment issues (for 
good or for bad).  For example, NBD_INFO_BLOCK_SIZE is 18 bytes; all 
NBD_CMD_* 32-bit requests are 28 bytes except for NBD_CMD_WRITE which 
can send unaligned payload with no further padding, and so forth.

and which would be mutually-exclusive with NBD_INFO_SPARSE (except for 
an image of size 0).  That bit would ALSO be an indication that the user 
may not want to punch holes into the image, but preserve the 
fully-allocated state (and thus avoid NBD_CMD_TRIM as well as passing 
NBD_CMD_FLAG_NO_HOLE to any WRITE_ZEROES request).
