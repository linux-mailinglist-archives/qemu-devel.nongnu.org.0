Well there's no real guarantee that any of the previous committers will
take the patch even if they are listed by get_maintainer. This is typical
with anything lacking a maintainer assigned. We typically hope that
whoever runs the "misc" queue sees the patch and picks it up, but often
it requires pings to remind someone to pick it up.

The only real right answer here is to actually get someone as the
nominated maintainer. Every other scenario is a just a band aid and
is not a good experiance for contributors. A nominated reviewer is
usually hoped to be a stepping stone to someone becoming maintainer
in future, so in that sense the fact that only you will be cc'd is
sort of intentional :-)

Daniel
