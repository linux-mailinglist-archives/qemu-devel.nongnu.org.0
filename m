Yes, it's that too.

I think you had to use something like

    -nic none -nic none -nic GOOD-ONE -nic none

to get virtual hardware that matches the physical hardware, which I
understand has all four MACs on the die, but only MAC2 connected to the
outside.

In particular, the default configuration (no -nic, -nodefaults, etc.)
got you only MAC0.  With just -nodefaults, you got none at all.

> Now, a single -nic is enough.

Now you get all four MACs regardless of configuration, but only MAC2 can
be connected to a backend, e.g. with a single -nic.

The default configuration (no -nic, -nodefaults, etc.) just works: MAC2
connected to the default network backend.

With just -nodefaults, MAC2 remains unconnected.

This matches how other machines work.
