All agreed, Peter.

However, there is an additional interesting aspect here:

DS3231 is a fairly common module for RasPi. (and, is common for some other
systems with non-arm cpus too)

I hoped that setting up RasPi emulation with newly created RTC device would
be a peace of cake, but it might be that I was wrong. I see certain
inconsistency between our command line switches "-rtc" and "-watchdog".
Using "-watchdog", a watchdog timer model can be specified, but for "-rtc",
it looks, there is no such posibility.

Given modularity of RasPi, wouldn't it be nice for end users to be able to
specify an RTC via command line?

If usage of command line is ruled out, what would be an alternative way to
integrate particular RTC support in RasPi (for any QEMU-supported RTC, not
only (for now, just envisioned) DS3231)?

Sory if I missed something big here.

Yours,
Aleksandar

We should probably prefer to go with a device that&#39;s a<br>
