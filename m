I actually really dislike the postfix-if-else too. I prefer C's ternary
there, but when in Rome, etc.

It turns out that your suggestion is fine. I do agree, though: I like my
unnecessary parentheses a lot.

Python wants:

assert a =3D=3D b

And will get mad about:

assert (a =3D=3D b)

And that's just so hard to deal with when working with C-brain.
