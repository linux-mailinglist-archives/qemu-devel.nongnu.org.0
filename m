I have some typo/grammar nits below, but more significantly:
I don't really see why this is a bit of QEMU's documentation
rather than, say, a blog post. It doesn't really say much
about QEMU in particular. It's also rather vague about
what guest architecture it's talking about, and they can
differ significantly both in the real world and in how QEMU
handles them. Also, why put it in interop?

Previously you used '-----' as the title format for "next
