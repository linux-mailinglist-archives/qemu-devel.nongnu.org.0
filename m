Sadly there's no good standardised terminology here. Aarch64 provides 
the "normal (cacheable)" definition. Memory which is mapped as "Normal 
Cacheable" is implicitly MTE capable when shared with a guest (because 
the stage 2 mappings don't allow restricting MTE other than mapping it 
as Device memory).

So MTE also forces us to have a definition of memory which is "bog 
standard memory"[1] separate from the mapping attributes. This is the 
main memory which fully supports MTE.

Separate from the "bog standard" we have the "special"[1] memory, e.g. 
ZONE_DEVICE memory may be mapped as "Normal Cacheable" at stage 1 but 
that memory may not support MTE tags. This memory can only be safely 
shared with a guest in the following situations:

  1. MTE is completely disabled for the guest

  2. The stage 2 mappings are 'device' (e.g. DEVICE_nGnRE)

  3. We have some guarantee that guest MTE access are in some way safe.

(1) is the situation today (without this patch series). But it prevents 
the guest from using MTE in any form.

(2) is pretty terrible for general memory, but is the get-out clause for 
mapping devices into the guest.

(3) isn't something we have any architectural way of discovering. We'd 
need to know what the device did with the MTE accesses (and any caches 
between the CPU and the device) to ensure there aren't any side-channels 
or h/w lockup issues. We'd also need some way of describing this memory 
to the guest.

So at least for the time being the approach is to avoid letting a guest 
with MTE enabled have access to this sort of memory.

[1] Neither "bog standard" nor "special" are real terms - like I said 
there's a lack of standardised terminology.

So if I'm understanding this correctly for KVM we need to use 
pfn_to_online_pages() and reject if NULL is returned? In the case of 
dax/kmem there already needs to be validation that the memory supports 
MTE (otherwise we break user space) before it's allowed into the 
"ordinary system RAM" bucket.
