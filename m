1/ How do we check for distribution rights?

Is it OK for:
- a Debian/Fedora image
- a compiled Linux kernel (for a Debian/Fedora release)

2/ Who to ask to add files to this assets directory?

3/ Can we use a 'webarchive' directory structure?

Such /site/date/original_site_path/file

4/ What are the chances that this website disappears? :S

(Someone has to pay for it, and the bandwidth...)

Thanks,

Phil.
