In the proposed "solution 1" my role would be to maintain, judge and help analyzing the reports if needed. As for the fixing the code I can not serve, that would have to be on the individual contributors/maintainers, the best I can do is to bisect and CC the authors.

In "solution 2" that would be on the other volunteer with my assistance, if needed. Note that currently the pipeline is not that clever so it requires manual interaction for bisection but I do have plan on improving that soon.

Also note that the purpose of this email is also a call for ideas, because maybe there is a better tool out there and if it fitted our needs better I wouldn't mind to switching to it.

Luk치코
