We shouldn't need todo any of those tricks IIUC.  The --fork argument is
supposed to only let the parent process exit once the server is running.

IOW, if you run qemu-nbd --fork, in the foreground, then when execution
continues the sockets should be present & accepting connections. No need
to check for existance of any files or check connecting, etc.


Except that AFAICT, --fork isn't actually implemented with this semantics
in qemu-nbd. It looks like we only listen on the sockets after the parent
has already exited :-( Can we fix that to synchronize wrt socket listener=
s ?
