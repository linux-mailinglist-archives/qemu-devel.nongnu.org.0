I guess we at point where patch is better then words, I'll send one as reply here shortly.
I've just implemented subset of above (opened, closed+locked).

I didn't mean fwcfg in this context, what I meant if firmware were able
to avoid using RAM(0x30000+128K) range (since it becomes unusable after locking).
Looks like you just answered it here
