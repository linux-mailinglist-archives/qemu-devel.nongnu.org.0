Yeah, the key thing is that you really want to be able to provide the
whole initial config in one go as an atomic action. I don't want to
issue 100 individual QMP commands to load each initial device. With
that in mind it doesn't really matter whether you do

  $ qemu -qmp stdio
  (qmp) load-config /some/file.yaml

vs

  $ qemu -qmp stdio -load-config /some/file.yaml

though the latter is probably slightly nicer as it lets you grep
for the VM based on the filename visible in the CLI.

My gut feeling is that we need to do something a bit more adventurous
if we're to get QEMU to move forward in solving the 10+ year old problem
of a formally described, consistent configuration syntax.

Just deprecating & removing -readconfig is just one small mole hill out
of 100 so doesn't move things along much on its own.


I tend to think we'd be better served by focusing on introducing a new set
of binaries,  qemu-vm-$TARGET, which exclusively use a new config syntax,
free of any legacy baggage present in qemu-system-$TARGET.

Work on qemu-vm-$TARGET will involve refactoring, and that will certainly
risk causing bugs in qemu-system-$TARGET. The premise though is that this
risk is lower, than if we tried to retrofit a new config syuntax directly
into qemu-system-$TARGET.

In particular I think it is basically impossible to do any meaningful
changes in the main() method of softmmu/vl.c, due to the fragile ordering
for creation of various different devices/backends, and its interaction
with the argv parsing. By using a new qemu-vm-$TARGET we can have a new
softmmu/vm.c, instead of vl.c. We'll still likely need to modify parts of
vl.c to use new/changed API calls, but that's less distruptive, as we
can leave the crazy logic for ordering of device creation untouched.


In the past we've been fairly cautious of any change which might risk
back compat problems in qemu-system-$TARGET. I think we can say we're not
going to gratuitously break qemu-system-$TARGET, but at the same time we
are not going to make heroic efforts at (unachievable) perfection.

IOW, accept that we'll probably cause regressions in some edge cases in
qemu-system-$TARGET. We'll make reasonable effort to fix them if they
are reported, but we're willing to accept the risk of disruption in the
short term, in order to get to a better long term solution.

Depending on how much of a burden it is to keep qemu-system-$TARGET around
long term, it could exist forever without any new feature work on its CLI;
Or it could be turned into a shim around qemu-vm-$TARGET; Or it could
be deprecated over a prolonged period (as opposed to the usual 2 release
minimum).

Regards,
Daniel
