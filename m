I understand that. Ideally it should be forbidden. Perhaps that could be
fixed by turning drv->supports_backing into a function.

My point however is that forcing a different backing file is something
that is going to cause breakage unless the user really knows that
they're doing. And we don't generally forbid that, we just let the user
take responsibility. So I'm not too worried about this case.

It should be easy to handle in qcow2_co_preadv_part() and
qcow2_co_copy_range_from(), but it feels hackish and error prone.

Preallocation has its problems (and we would also have to handle it
differently if there are subclusters, but I think that should be
easy). But I don't have a strong opinion.
