Yep, good catch.

The mutex is the simplest but I wonder if it show up on heavy usage? The
log file is already doing file locking for the areas that want
contiguous log statements.

I wonder if using RCU to swap out the new and old FD would make things a
bit smoother here? You would have to tweak the qemu_log_lock/unlock
functions to preserve the current FD around the lock and call_rcu a
freeing function when a new handle is set.
