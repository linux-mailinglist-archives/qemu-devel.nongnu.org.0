Yes, I have a lot of --disable-foo options. Ideally I wouldn't
need any, because our configure/build system would identify "there
isn't actually a static version of this dependency present"
rather than blindly trusting pkg-config when it lies to us.
(Is it possible to get Meson to just always do a "test that
a trivial program with these cflags and libs will build" as
part of whatever magic it does as part of dependency() ?
Or to have a qemu_dependency() wrapper that does ?)

The useful thing about libgtk is that it's pretty obvious
that the --disable option to use to stop QEMU linking to
it is --disable-gtk. It's much less obvious what would be
the --disable option to use to stop us linking against
libgio, or libudev, because those dependencies aren't closely
and obviously tied to QEMU features. So for that kind of
library dependency it's much more useful to have configure
do enough checks that it doesn't try to link against something
that doesn't exist.
