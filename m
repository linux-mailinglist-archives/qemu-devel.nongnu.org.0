If the user has a guest image that's expecting to run in protected
machine mode, presumably this will fail to boot if run on a host
which doesn't support this feature ?

As a mgmt app I think there will be a need to be able to determine
whether a host + QEMU combo is actually able to support protected
machines. If the mgmt app is given an image and the users says it
required protected mode, then the mgmt app needs to know which
host(s) are able to run it.

Doing version number checks is not particularly desirable, so is
there a way libvirt can determine if QEMU + host in general supports
protected machines, so that we can report this feature to mgmt apps ?


If a guest has booted & activated protected mode is there any way
for libvirt to query that status ? This would allow the mgmt app
to know that the guest is not going to be migratable thereafter.

Is there any way to prevent a guest from using protected mode even
if QEMU supports it ?  eg the mgmt app may want to be able to
guarantee that all VMs are migratable, so don't want a guest OS
secretly activating protected mode which blocks migration.

Presumably QEMU is going to set a migration blocker when a guest
activates protected mode ?

Is there any way to securely acquire a key needed to interpret this,
or is the memory dump completely useless ?
