Ok, so I've gone back and properly read the series. Since you're simply
extending existing commands with new arguments I've no objection to
carrying on with this approach.

We should still aim to have a general purpose command for live config
changes, but that shouldn't be considered a blocker for you series
here, as your series isn't making the existing situation worse.

I've realized that we shouldn't overload display-reload for dual purposes.

We have two distinct usage scenarios that are meaningul

 - Re-loading the value of the existing secret
 - Changing which secret is used

The 'display-reload' command is reasonable for the first.

We should have a 'display-update' command for the second.

Either way, I don't think this series should be blocked on this since
it is merely modifying an existing command.

Daniel
