Point taken.

Possible mitigation: add at the end rather than in the middle.

It is, for OOB commands.

Yes, but pretty much everything below handle_qmp_command() falls apart
then.  Remembering to update monitor_curp() would be the least of my
worries :)

Correct.

Yes, that's fair.

The solution Daniel proposed is makes the weakness more explicit:
instead of relying on "coroutine was created with this coroutine-local
storage", we'd rely on "coroutine_getspecific(key) does not fail".  It
can fail only if coroutine_setspecific(key, ...) was not called.  Not
much better in practice.

Daniel's solution is basically pthread_getspecific() for coroutines,
with the keys dumbed down.

If pthread_getspecific() was good enough for pthreads...

Well, it wasn't, or rather it was only because something better could
not be had with just a library, without toolchain support.  And that's
where we are with coroutines.

I did not expect coroutine creation / deletion to be a hot path.

It is not a hot path for QMP, because QMP is not a hot path.

I'm ready to accept the proposition that it's a hot path elsewhere.
