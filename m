Maybe because these were based on your screamer branch but I could 
cherry-pick them from there to your qemu-macppc branch without issue.

I've just posted the rebased series.

Your original comment was:

"Given that this needs to work with both qemu-system-ppc and 
qemu-system-ppc64 would casting bios_addr to target_ulong work?"

This cast only appears in mac_oldworld.c which is qemu-system-ppc only (or 
not different in qemu-system-ppc64 unlike mac_newworld.c) so target_ulong 
there is basically uint32_t. I've changed the cast accordingly but I think 
it does not really matter.

As said in previous message the i2c and SPD patches are not quite ready 
yet so I've omitted those from this series, I may rework them later once 
this part is merged and can rebase the rest on top of that. We would also 
need your screamer patches to get the Mac ROM working, what is still 
missing for those?
