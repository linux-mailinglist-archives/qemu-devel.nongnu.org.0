Overall I agree with Palmer that we should accept all extensions in
the RISC-V foundations ISA manual once the extension has reached some
level of maturity.

I think it then makes sense to only keep the latest version of these
drafts until they are ratified. At that point we do have to support
the ratified version for longer.
