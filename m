Turns out 1.12 is a fairly old build and the working version in Ubuntu was =
from in Disco, therefore about a year ago.
=3D> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seabios/1.12.0-1/+build/16284605

Therefore I built it in Eoan and even Disco.
As an overview:
Disco: gcc 4:8.3.0-1ubuntu3   binutils 2.32-7ubuntu4
Eoan:  gcc 4:9.2.1-3.1ubuntu1 binutils 2.33-2ubuntu1.2
Focal: gcc 4:9.2.1-3.1ubuntu1 binutils 2.34-4ubuntu1

I ended up with these binaries to test:
./git-built-in-eoan/rel-1.12/bios.bin Breaks
./git-built-in-eoan/rel-1.13/bios.bin Breaks
./git-built-in-disco/rel-1.13/bios.bin Works
./git-built-in-disco/rel-1.12/bios.bin Works
./git-built-in-focal/head/bios.bin Breaks
./git-built-in-focal/rel-1.12/bios.bin Breaks
./git-built-in-focal/rel-1.13/bios.bin Breaks
./packaging/disco-seabios_1.12.0-1/bios.bin Works
./packaging/focal-seabios_1.13.0-1/bios.bin Breaks

To summarize:
- qemu breaks on chips of the Penryn generation
- it only breaks if the seabios bios is executed
- does not really depend on seabios or qemu version
- but it depends on seabios build environment

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
