That isn't actually correct. In fact best practice is to *not* set and
"-k keymap" arg when launching QEMU.

Any kind of keysym to scancode conversion done by QEMU is inherantly
lossy and fragile as it requires a 100% matching keymap between QEMU
and the guest OS. QEMU keymaps are much better than the past, but
they're never going to be guaranteed to match what the guest OS is
using because they're potentialy using completely different data
sources.

By not setting "-k", you let the QEMU VNC server activate its keyboard
scancode VNC protocol extension. With this active, a compatible VNC
client will then send raw hardware scancodes to QEMU alongside keysyms.

QEMU will thus ignore the keysyms and send the scancodes straight to
the guest with no keymap conversion performed at all. 

With this working you can just dynamically change your guest OS keymap
as needed to match your VNC client machine's keyboard and QEMU stays
out of the way entirely. 

Obviously the important thing here is to have a VNC client that supports
this scancode extension. This was originally done in the GTK-VNC widget,
and thus virt-viewer, remote-viewer, vinagre, virt-manager, GNOME Boxes
all support this.  More recently the TigerVNC client app also supports
this, as does the in browser noVNC client.

I don't think it is worth creating a new VNC protocol extension for this,
since any kind of keymap conversion done on the server is inherantly
lossy so can never be bug free. Since a new extension requires modifying
VNC clients regardless, it is better to just modify them to support the
raw scancode extension instead.
