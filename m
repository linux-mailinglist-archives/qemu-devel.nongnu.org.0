We need proper integration with the existing trace UI.

In particular, the ability to enable and disable trace events
dynamically provided by QMP commands trace-event-get-state,
trace-event-set-state, and HMP command trace-event is really useful.

Integration need not mean implement the existing interface slavishly!
Feel free to evolve it.  For instance, the QMP commands provide
"case-sensitive glob", while you have full regexps.  You could extend
the commands to also accept regexps.

We can talk about leaving gaps for later.

I recommend to start with QMP.
