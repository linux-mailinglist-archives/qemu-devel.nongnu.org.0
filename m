What's "tbs"?

Why is listing them useful?

What do you mean by "some metric"?

What do you mean by "and investigate their code?"

Your use of [square brackets] in .help is unusual.  Please try to have
your commands' help blend into the existing help.

When a parameter takes a percentage, "number" is a suboptimal name :)

Standard request for new HMP commands without corresponding QMP
commands: please state in the commit message why the QMP command is not
worthwhile.

HMP commands without a QMP equivalent are okay if their functionality
makes no sense in QMP, or is of use only for human users.

Example for "makes no sense in QMP": setting the current CPU, because a
QMP monitor doesn't have a current CPU.

Examples for "is of use only for human users": HMP command "help", the
integrated pocket calculator.

Debugging commands are kind of borderline.  Debugging is commonly a
human activity, where HMP is just fine.  However, humans create tools to
assist with their activities, and then QMP is useful.  While I wouldn't
encourage HMP-only for the debugging use case, I wouldn't veto it.

Your (overly terse!) commit message and help texts make me guess the
commands are for gathering statistics.  Statistics can have debugging
uses.  But they often have non-debugging uses as well.  What use cases
can you imagine for these commands?
