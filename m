Thanks for your detailed explanation. This makes things a bit clearer.

I will try reproduce and get a better insight what is happening.


 From a first look at the code I was curious that we modify req->overlap_bytes and req->overlap_offset

without the bs->reqs_lock lock held. We also modify req->serializing. All three are accessed in wait_serializing_requests

while we might modify them.


Best,

Peter
