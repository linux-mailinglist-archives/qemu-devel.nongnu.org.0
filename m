VDE2 package is available in Ubuntu at least, so we could possibly
build in our CI that way I believe:

The website(s) are certainly not very clear as to what's the right
thing to be using.

The vde-2 code appears to be deprecated from what I can see though

http://wiki.virtualsquare.org/#!repos.md

"The vde-2 vde_switch is fully compatible with vdeplug4. Although
 it has not been rewritten yet, it includes several tools that are
 actual like vde\switch and wirefilter."

The vdeplug4 repo docs do refer to QEMU's  'vde' network config

   https://github.com/rd235/vdeplug4

but the repository doesn't show especially high level of activity
and I don't see this in any distros, only the old vde-2.

It is in Ubuntu.  If it isn't widely available in distributions though,
that is surely a reflection the level of usage amongst users. 

The popular high performance userspace networking project(s) (DPDK) these
days all seem to be based around QEMU's vhostuser or TAP backends, which
is good as it means QEMU doesn't need to support an application specific
backend.
