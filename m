Correct. For data aborts in general, the extra syndrome information in ISS[23:14] is 
only provided at EL2, in order to help hypervisors emulate simple loads/stores (that 
access device memory) by looking at ESR_EL2 without having to decode the trapped 
instruction. Did you have any particular use-case in mind for SAS being set even in 
ESR_EL1?
