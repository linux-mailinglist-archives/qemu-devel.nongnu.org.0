This is really strange behaviour.  I've done some further test builds
on travis with various extra debug info & AFAICT, inotify is not
working correctly on the host - it is never emitting one of the events
that it should. Could be some wierd bug related to the filesystem
overlay setup used for the container env in travis I guess.

I'm not sure what todo here. I can't see an obvious trait that I can
use to identify a broken setup, in order to auto-skip the test. Might
just need to build without the inotify support somehow.

Regards,
Daniel
