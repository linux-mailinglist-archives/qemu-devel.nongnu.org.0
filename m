Specifically for PPC we don't have them. We use the softfloat test cases
to exercise our softfloat/hardfloat code as part of "make
check-softfloat". You can also re-build fp-bench for each guest target
to measure raw throughput.

It would work but it would be slow. Almost every FP operation sets
the inexact flag so it would generate an exception and exceptions take
time to process.

For the guests where we use hardfloat operations with inexact already
latched is not a corner case - it is the common case which is why it
helps.
