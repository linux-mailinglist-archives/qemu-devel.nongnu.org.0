Hello,
I am working on vCPU Hotplug feature for ARM64 and I am in mid of understan=
ding some aspect of device_add/device_del interface of the QEMU.

Observations:
1. Any object initialised by qmp_device_add() gets into /machine/unattached=
 container. I traced the flow to code leg inside  device_set_realized()
2. I could see the reverse qmp_device_del() expects the device to be in  /m=
achine/peripheral container.
3. I could see any object initially added to unattached container did not h=
ad their parents until object_add_property_child() was called further in th=
e leg.
    which effectively meant a new property was created and property table p=
opulated and child was parented.
4. Generally, container  /machine/peripheral was being used wherever DEVICE=
(dev)->id was present and non-null.

Question:
1. Wanted to confirm my understanding about the use of having separate cont=
ainers like unattached, peripheral and anonymous.
2. At init time all the vcpus goes under *unattached* container. Now, qmp_d=
evice_del() cannot be used to unplug them. I am wondering
   if all the hotplug devices need to go under the *peripheral* container w=
hile they are hotplugged and during object init time as well?
3. I could not see any device being place under *anonymous* container durin=
g init time. What is the use of this container?

I would be thankful for your valuable insights and answers and help in high=
lighting any gap in my understanding.

Thanks in anticipation!

Best Regards
Salil
