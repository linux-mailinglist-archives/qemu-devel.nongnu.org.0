Follow fork is awkward and error prone when the launcher performs many forks before forking
qemu. gdb --args does not work when the launcher sets up an environment for qemu to run
in, pre-opening fd's being just one example.  For developers, often the "launcher" is a 
script that performs setup and passes the myriad qemu options.  Even in that case, it is
easier to add a flag or set an env var to enable debugging. The pause option is fast 
(for the user) and reliable.  

I have a new version of the patch that handles the signal more smoothly, so the handshake
with gdb is easier:

    $ QEMU_PAUSE=1 qemu-system-x86_64 ...
    QEMU pid 18371 is stopped.

                                     $ gdb -p 18371
                                     (gdb) break rcu_init
                                     (gdb) signal SIGCONT
                                     Breakpoint 1, rcu_init () at util/rcu.c:380

The implementation does not even send a signal to qemu, so the launcher is none the wiser:

static void pause_me(void)
{
    int sig;
    sigset_t set, oldset;
    sigemptyset(&set);
    sigaddset(&set, SIGCONT);
    printf("QEMU pid %d is stopped.  Send SIGCONT to continue.\n", getpid());
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &set, &oldset);
    sigwait(&set, &sig);                          <-- PAUSES HERE
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oldset, 0);
}


I will post it if you are still open to the idea.  Please let me know.
