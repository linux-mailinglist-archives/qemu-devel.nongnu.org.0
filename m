Yes, it is so.
There are no interrupt for topology change, no event or any other 
notification, I guess the overhead has been considered too high.

I guess that a change to the topology is done when (1) a CPU is not 
running, exists in the configuration and used to be running but then is 
being moved in the stopped state, so its environment can be safely 
migrated to another CPU for the next scheduling slice or (2) when the 
CPU is added to or removed from the configuration.

I also guess that what would be nice would be to get the information in 
the guest when it needs to get scheduling decisions.
I had a try on this but it was not done right and I must think a little 
bit more on this. Currently the Linux kernel does a poling every minute 
using PTF(2) which is speed up to 100ms in case the admin voluntary 
changes the topology.
