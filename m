Hi Daniel, Stefan

We have not replied in a while as we were trying to figure out
the best approach after multiple comments we have received on the
patch series.

Leaving other concerns that you, Stefan and others shared with us
out of this particular topic, we would like to get your opinion on
the following approach.

Please see below.

We see libvirt uses QEMU=E2=80=99s -sandbox option to indicate that QEMU
should use seccomp() to prohibit future use of certain system calls,
including fork() and exec().  Our idea is to enumerate the remote
processes needed via QEMU command line options, and have QEMU exec()
those processes before -sandbox is processed.
And we also will init seccomp for emulated devices processes.

We agree with that. With above proposed approach we still have to change =
hotplug
in some way.
If a eparate process will be spawned, libvirt will be the one doing
fork/exec of the separate processes. Or possibly launch a helper
binaries that will unify the way how an instance is being started with
multiple processes and hotplugging.

Thanks!
Elena, Jag, John.
