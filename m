As described in the included documentation, the "custom runner" jobs
extend the GitLab CI jobs already in place.

Those jobs are intended to run on hardware and/or Operating Systems
not provided by GitLab's shared runners.

+
+Jobs on Custom Runners
+======================
+
+Besides the jobs run under the various CI systems listed before, there
+are a number additional jobs that will run before an actual merge.
+These use the same GitLab CI's service/framework already used for all
+other GitLab based CI jobs, but rely on additional systems, not the
+ones provided by GitLab as "shared runners".
+
+The architecture of GitLab's CI service allows different machines to
+be set up with GitLab's "agent", called gitlab-runner, which will take
+care of running jobs created by events such as a push to a branch.
+Here, the combination of a machine, properly configured with GitLab's
+gitlab-runner, is called a "custom runner" here.
+
+The GitLab CI jobs definition for the custom runners are located under::
+
+  .gitlab-ci.d/custom-runners.yml
+
+Current Jobs
+------------
+
+The current CI jobs based on custom runners have the primary goal of
+catching and preventing regressions on a wider number of host systems
+than the ones provided by GitLab's shared runners.
+
+Also, the mechanics of reliability, capacity and overall maintanance
+of the machines provided by the QEMU project itself for those jobs
+will be evaluated.
+
+Future Plans and Jobs
+---------------------
+
+Once the CI Jobs based on custom runners have been proved mature with
+the initial set of jobs run on machines from the QEMU project, other
+members in the community should be able provide their own machine
+configuration documentation/scripts, and accompanying job definitions.
+
+As a general rule, those newly added contributed jobs should run as
+"non-gating", until their reliability is verified.
+
+The precise minimum requirements and exact rules for machine
+configuration documentation/scripts, and the success rate of jobs are
+still to be defined.
