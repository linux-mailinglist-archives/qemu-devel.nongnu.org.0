Cleber, Eduardo, that's a good discussion. I was expecting we would 
eventually evolve the acceptance tests to use Avocado varianter feature.

Now I think what to do with this series.

I can see the usefulness of patch 01 when you want to, for example, 
start qemu expecting a crash or just want to gather information from 
command-line (qemu -cpu help, qemu -accel help...etc).

The implementation on patch 02 to check the availability of accelerators 
seems desirable even on this (near, maybe) future where tests can be 
automatically derived.

Thus, can we merge patches 01 and 02 only? Of course, if they pass the 
reviews.

Thanks!
