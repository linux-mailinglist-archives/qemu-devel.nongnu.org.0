Title:
  seabios hell

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  getting weird annoying seabios hell and not sure how to fix it.

  ok.

  there IS a SEA-BIOS. There IS a way in.

  -I found it by mistake.(and yall need to move the BIOS key...its in
  the wrong place)

  I was tryng to boot Yosemite to re-install. I mashed the key too early
  and it wanted to boot the hard drive.

  Apparently the bios loads AFTER the hard drive wants to boot, not
  BEFORE it.And it will ONLY load when booting a hard disk.

  ..Booting hard disk...[mash F8 here but let go and wait]
  eventually will want to load the OS and clear the screen[mash F8 again]

  --Youre in!

  Its tiny, like a mini award bios but youre in! =

  -Change anything HERE, though...and kiss booting a cd goodbye!

  Im trying to diagnose a black screen, seems related to seabios, not
  the vga driver.

  -mayhaps wants to boot hard disk but in fact its not bootable as the
  installer hung(and often unices install bootloader late in process)?

  I cant boot the disc to reinstall to tell. But I have a few dos iso
  lying around...hmmm.
