RFC 4627's original sin:

    4.  Parsers
    [...]
    An implementation may set limits on the size of texts that it
    accepts.  An implementation may set limits on the maximum depth of
    nesting.  An implementation may set limits on the range of numbers.
    An implementation may set limits on the length and character contents
    of strings.

Giving license to set limits is not a sin, absence of minimal limits is.

Became an actual problem only when many implementations followed the
early JavaScript implementation(s), which had inherited JavaScript's
quick-and-dirty approach to numerical towers: double should be enough
for anybody.

Enables compatible evolution of interfaces, which has been a massive win
for us.

We can discuss everything, but please not everything in the same thread.
This one is / tries to be about the QAPI schema language.

In our field, dissing prior technical choices without making an effort
to understand the tradeoffs that led to them is an ancient tradition :)
