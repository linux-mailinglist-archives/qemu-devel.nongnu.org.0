Hi,

Seeing this same thing! And I'm on Ubuntu 20.10, so pretty current :-).
vt82c686b-usb-uhci doesn't seem to be accessible any more, but trying
qemu-xhci =3D> no joy, still have to reset the VM after each startup, to
get the keyboard and mouse working.

Is this expected?

Thanks!

Title:
  Passthrough USB Host Keyboard doesn't work on Q35 platform on boot-up

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu-kvm package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  Using qemu-kvm as shipped with Ubuntu 16.04, I cannot get a passed-
  through USB Host Keyboard to work at boot-up using the Q35 platform.

  My minimal example to verify this bug is the following:

    qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35 -m 128 -cdrom mini.iso -usb -usbdevice
  host:04ca:005a -vnc :1 -display none

  Using a noname USB Keyboard with ID 04ca:005a and the Ubuntu 16.04
  NetBoot mini.iso, I can see the boot screen of the Ubuntu ISO through
  VNC, but pressing the arrow keys doesn't do anything.

  By taking out the "-M q35" parameter, QEMU switches to the traditional
  i440FX system. The passed-through USB Host Keyboard works there, but
  the old platform is no option for me.
