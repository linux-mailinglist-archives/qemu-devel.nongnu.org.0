I *think* that peter is perhaps right, but it is not clear at all, and
it is easier to be safe.  I think that the only case that this could
matter is if:
- all pages are clean (so complete_round will get as true)
- we went a queue_page request

Is that possible?  I am not completely sure after looking at the code.
It *could* be if the page that got queued is the last page remaining,
but ......  I fully agree that the case that _almost all_ pages are
clean and we get a request for a queued page is really rare, so it
should not matter in real life, but ....

Later, Juan.
