I also thought about VirtualBox may worth a look at as that supports 
clipboard sharing and there's also Synergy 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy_(software)] that I don't know much 
but it's cross platform and may support clipboard sharing. It seems to 
have an open source fork called Barrier: 
https://github.com/debauchee/barrier
