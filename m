@tstrike - can you trigger the same issue with all your guests?
You list Windows and Centos guests, does it triggers with Centos as well or=
 only the Windows guests?
Also if you have a chance (just to be sure) does it trigger with an Ubuntu =
guest as well? This would help for people retrying not using a case that do=
esn't even trigger in your setup.

@tstrike - you seem to hit this while starting your guest through libvirt.
Could you please attach your guest XML so that we can try to recreate this =
case?
  $ virsh dumpxml <guestname>
That will help when trying to recreate your case.

@tstrike
It would also be helpful to get your qemu commandline as well as any furthe=
r messages qemu might have reported.
You'll find that in the per guest log file at:
 $ cat /var/log/libvirt/qemu/<guestname>.log

If you could report all that here that should be useful for everyone
tracking this bug.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
