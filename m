Ah, you're right. It's the first commit that you reference.

I don't. That's why I've put them both in curly braces. Perhaps this 
says its better:

switch (klass) {
  case CommandNotFound:
  case CommandDisabled:
        /* okay */
        break;

  default:
        /* bad, error out */
        break;
}
