Sorry for the confusion. It's not timeout.
It's just that we hope the hotplug process to be faster.

It's because kernel will wait one second for link to become active if
Link Active Reporting Capable is not available.
Refer to 'pciehp_check_link_status()' in drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c.

We have tried that but found out the PDC event can't be sent because PDCE is not set in SlotCtrl Register.
It's because kernel didn't set PDCE if there exists the attention button.
Refer to 'pcie_enable_notification()' in drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp_hpc.c
It seems to avoid power interrupt storm on some machine.
Also I think we may clear Presence Detect State after the device is remove, otherwise
kernel will print 'Card not present'. But it has no bad effect, the device is still removed.
Kernel will power off the slot after remove the device. If qemu can catch this event, we can clear
Presence Detect State there.
