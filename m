Public bug reported:

TL;DR: When QEMU is launched with VNC as the output and viewed with a
client that defaults to zlib VNC encoding, the resulting output tends to
accumulate artifacts.

Reproduction:
Launch QEMU (tried with versions 4.2.0 and 4.1.0 on Linux  64bit) with -vnc=
 0.0.0.0:0
Connect to it with a VNC client that allows you to select encoding, i.e. Ul=
traVNC.
Set encoding to zlib (type 6), 32bit color.
As screen content changes it starts accumulating artifacts. Almost certain =
to appear if you open-close windows over a pattern.
Does not seem to depend on guest used, but easier to reproduce with a GUI.

Looks like this: https://orbides.org/img/vnc.png

It appears to be a deflate glitch of some sort - all of the bad pixels
are generated by length/distance codes. Can't narrow it down any more.
