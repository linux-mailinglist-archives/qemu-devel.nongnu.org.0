That's ok, I can probably get openpower to put a link to the ARM one
somewhere :-)

It is done and so now we have two architectures using that standard, I
think the value in using the same overweight the value in fixing it but
yes, we should try to agree on a method of extending at least. Is it
really that hard ?

IE. We could add a new call for capabilities that takes a pointer to
a region which we pre-zero before calling in the client and if remains
zero after the call, then the new stuff isn't there for example. That
sort of stuff is easy, or am I missing something ?

Cheers,
Ben.
