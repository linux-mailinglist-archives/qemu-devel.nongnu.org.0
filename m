You may be right that we don't want your original scripts, but that also  implies that the 
fact your files are generated is irrelevant to us.  Why should we care?  I think it makes 
more sense to manually edit csr.c and be done with it.

I'm sure your syntax was incorrect.  You probably used

>>> +  [CSR_CYCLE] { .gdb_type = "uint64", .gdb_group = "user" },

which does indeed overwrite the entire entry in the array.  You could have used

     [CSR_CYCLE].gdb_type = "uint64"

which will just set the one field.

That said, I don't think that we want this distributed initialization.

Hmm.  I didn't look at the docs; I looked at gdbtypes.h and saw the existence of 
builtin_unsigned_long.  I suppose this might not be plumbed into the xml.

In which case, since we're generating everything dynamically anyway, we could just as 
easily make NULL map to "uint<XLEN>" when generating the xml.  Or instead of a string, 
perhaps some enum which distinguishes data_ptr/code_ptr/uint<xlen>/uint<min(n,xlen)> which 
is then filled in during generation.

I wonder if this is an issue of using "uint32" for the field type?  You could, for the 
moment, drop all of the bitfield descriptions and leave the interpretation to the user. 
Giving an accurate integral value for the register as a whole is more helpful than giving 
inaccurate field values.

And that's where we're mis-communicating.

We're working toward having exactly one qemu-system-riscv binary, which will emulate both 
RV32 and RV64 (and RV128) cpus, selected by -cpu foo.  At which point there will be no 
CONFIG_RISCV32 define at all.  The way to distinguish the three cases is 
cpu->env.misa_mxl_max.

Well ideally yes...

... but as you rightly note, gdb can't handle it.
