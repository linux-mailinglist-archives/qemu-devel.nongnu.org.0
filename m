No it is a monotonically increasing cpu_index for each new CPUState
created. So the first thread is 1 and the second is 2 no matter what the
thread id is.

We don't actually use this prototype anymore. I had removed the concept
of vcpu_index from the translation time hooks (so people don't get any
ideas about it's significance there). However we do use vcpu_index with
the udata form.

So we do use it in the example plugins (hotpages tracks which vCPUs have
written to which pages). I think it is useful information for a plugin
but I think if you want per-vCPU structures in your plugin __thread is
going to be the easiest solution.
