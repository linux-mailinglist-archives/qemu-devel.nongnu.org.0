You're right, I am bundling together a few things.

This is a good standalone task, but

... Can't start until we define the proper interface, because then we
have to support it. Right now, qmp-shell is a developer toy because it's
hidden in the tree.

Promoting it to prime-time will be fruitless unless we come up with a
convincing TUI for it.

Yes, this is all just great sugar. Completely optional, non-necessary.
Forgive me for bringing up things like this so often.

Not requisite to start on the project, but are great auxiliary tasks
that would make it really shiny. Perfect GSoC/outreachy material.

More or less my suggestion for offering e.g. "?info block" sugar
commands in the qmp-shell: an interface for executing sugar commands in
a unified human shell.

So, I don't know if "The final death of HMP" is something we want to
pursue as a project (Even though I bring it up often, I consider it an
open question -- do we want this? I actually don't know. I had assumed
that working on a fancy qmp-shell would only be interesting if it meant
the death of HMP, but perhaps I am wrong.)

Before we integrate qmp-shell into the GUI, I suspect we at least want
to answer ourselves what we want qmp-shell to be:

- QMP only, but nice for humans to interface with, or
- QMP with extras, like "?info block"

This mission statement will inform our basic premise for the syntax, and
getting the basic syntax right is important for having a successful
GSoC/outreachy project.

The goals for the intership yes, but I am merely suggesting we come up
with a goal for what we want qmp-shell *to be* and what it is for, and
why it will benefit us.

Otherwise, it will be hard to offer direction to a student trying to
write code in a very political and opinionated area of our codebase.

So as requisites, I think we just need to answer:

- Do we want to get rid of HMP?

- Roughly, how do we want qmp-shell to act? Is it a REPL? Are we
convinced there is a workable QMP-compatible syntax that will be "easy
to use" (subjective) and "easy to parse" (subjective) in such a system?

- Do we like the existing syntax? (I assume we do not.)


And all the rest is details that can be worked out by discussions,
review, the student proposal, etc.

Yes! This is exactly what I want with "?info block" style commands in
qmp-shell: standalone qmp-shell extensions that implement one nugget of
functionality that make a task easy at the human level.

Things that are important to "make easy" will get extensions.

Things that aren't, won't.

Let's say we do remove HMP: Anyone who misses some of that functionality
... Well, if you care, please do contribute a qmp-shell plugin that adds it.

Oh, sure. This list is primarily here to state that there are very valid
reasons to make QEMU usable *directly* to people because there are
extremely valid reasons to be driving it directly.

I think the *exact nature* of all of these use cases is not as important
so much as they unambiguously exist.

These users are technical, but may or may not be intricately familiar
with QEMU inner workings.

Two takeaways:

- Having some sugar that doesn't assume they know *too much* is
important. A little bit of hand-holding is nice.

- Having an interface that does not get in your way when you know
exactly what you want is important to QEMU developers. (Allowing
raw/direct QMP input, showing raw/pretty-printed incoming and outgoing
QMP for writing documentation, etc.)

Yes, so let me say that the *deliverable* goals for a GSoC/Outreachy
project should just simply be *compatible* with our long-term roadmap/goals.

Having an idea for where we want to head will allow us to define a
tighter bound on what we want this summer without wasting effort.

(And will allow us to give more rapid feedback to the student without
arguing between ourselves what we even want. I just want us to agree on
a mission statement.)
