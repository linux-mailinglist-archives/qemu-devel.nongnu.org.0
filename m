As I see it, this is a regression from previous releases, therefore it
should be fixed in 4.0-stable.  Users are encountering this issue and
leaning on support groups like reddit.com/r/VFIO to find workarounds.
It would be a disservice to our user base and downstream consumers to
simply ignore this regression until the 4.1 release.  If this is the
first z-stream release of upstream QEMU with a new machine type, we've
been lucky, but previous discussions indicate that we cannot currently
change the irqchip mode without rev'ing the machine type for migration
compatibility.

Users who expect migration stability from VMs based on unreleased
development code are in for a world of hurt.  I assume that the 4.1
machine types are entirely unstable until 4.1 is released.  We
introduce them early in the development cycle because we've been burned
in the past introducing them late and inconsistently.  Ideally this
change would trigger a migration regression test to generate a warning
for the in-development machine type changing in an incompatible way,
we'd acknowledge that, perhaps log it to a changelog, and move on, but
I suspect we don't have such automated testing in place.  Thanks,

Alex
