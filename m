Yes. Basically the way snapshots with VM state work is that you write
the VM state to some offset after the end of the virtual disk, when the
VM state is completely written you snapshot the current state (including
both content of the virtual disk and VM state) and finally discard the
VM state again in the active L1 table.

I don't see a fundamental difference between sync and async in this
respect. Why can't you write the VM state to the current L1 table first
like we usually do?

We always have only one active L1 table at a time, which simplifies
cluster allocation a bit, so it would be preferable to keep it this way.
