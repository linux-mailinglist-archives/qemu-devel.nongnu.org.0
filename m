The current approach for provisioning our private runners is highly
undesirable IMHO. We are installing the full set of build deps on
the host OS install, at time of provisioning the runner.

We should instead be provisioning the hosts exclusively to have
docker, and then use containers for the build + test environment,
so we don't need to have sysadmin intervention on the runners when
a merge request adds a build dep.

If we want to new private runners to replace the shared runners
transparently, then the use of docker is basically a must have.
