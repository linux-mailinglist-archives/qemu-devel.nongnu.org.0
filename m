The upstream documentation on extending Sphinx is probably
a good place to start; in particular the tutorials are useful:

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/index.html

I have also found that a fair amount of trial-and-error,
examination of the source of Sphinx itself or of other
extensions, and occasionally asking questions on the Sphinx
mailing list has been necessary...

OK, how about:

# The purpose of this extension is to read the documentation comments
# in QAPI schema files, and insert them all into the current document.
#
# It implements one new rST directive, "qapi-doc::".
# Each qapi-doc:: directive takes one argument, which is the

#
# The docs/conf.py file must set the qapidoc_srctree config value to
# the root of the QEMU source tree.

It doesn't work on all the things we'd like to intersperse().
If you try defining intersperse as

def intersperse(iterable, separator):
    separator.join(iterable)

then you get an exception:

Yes. I think this was a legacy from conversion from scripts/qapi/doc.py,
which does pass in a 'Values' string, but it does that because it shares
code in texi_members() between enums and other things. In this code
I chose to split that out into different functions rather than using
one function with a member_func argument because the member vs enum
code is different enough that it's clearer that way. But I didn't
notice that there wasn't any longer much point in passing a 'what'
argument.

Fixed to hard-code 'Values' rather than passing it as an argument.

I'm not sure what you have in mind here, so I'll leave it as it is :-)

This is probably just me not being a very experienced Python
programmer. What's the syntax for passing _add_doc the single list
which is just the concatenation of the various lists that
the _nodes_for_* methods return ?

Yes. I realized after sending v5 that this could be made to
call _serror() instead of directly raising the ExtensionError.

They look like this:

Warning, treated as error:
/home/petmay01/linaro/qemu-from-laptop/qemu/docs/../qapi/block.json:15:Bullet
list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

(I've just noticed that with Sphinx 1.6, which we still have
to support, the file/line info isn't passed through, so you get:

Warning, treated as error:
/home/petmay01/linaro/qemu-from-laptop/qemu/docs/interop/qemu-qmp-ref.rst:7:Bullet
list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

The plugin has code borrowed from kerneldoc.py which is
*supposed* to handle the older API Sphinx 1.6 used, but it
looks like it's broken. I'll have a look and see if it
is fixable, but possibly we may have to live with people
developing on old distros getting suboptimal errors.)

> Can we avoid the information loss?
>

How do I get a QAPIError from within one of the
visit_* or freeform methods of a QAPISchemaVisitor ?
The current texinfo doc generator doesn't do anything like that.
If there's a way to get a QAPIError given
 * the 'doc' argument passed into freeform/visit*
 * the specific error message we want to emit
then we can make the errors this script itself emits
(which are just the ones about headings: wrongly-subnested
headings, and headings that aren't the only thing in their
freeform-doc block) consistent with the other QAPIError ones.
[As I mentioned in some earlier thread, we are identifying
these errors here for pragmatic "it was easy" reasons,
though you could make a case that scripts/qapi/parser.py
should be doing it.]

(Aside: what was your conclusion on the question of section
headers, anyway? I need to go back and re-read the older
threads but I think that is still an unresolved topic...)

However I suspect we can't generate QAPIErrors for errors which are
produced by Sphinx itself when it's handed invalid rST:
the API Sphinx provides us is that we can annotate the lines
of rST that we are assembling from the input files to indicate
their "true" file/line number, but we can't intercept error
messages it emits. Think of it like the C compiler -- a
preprocessor can add #line directives to pass fixed up file/line
info to the compiler, but it isn't in the loop when the compiler
actually prints out errors.

> I had to read mostly backwards to understand the code.

Yes. This seems to be the standard way to write a Sphinx extension.
(Compare the kerneldoc.py and the various example extensions
in the Sphinx docs.)
