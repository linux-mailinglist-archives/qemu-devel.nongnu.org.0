Hi,

Ever since I found out that you can mount FUSE filesystems on regular
files (not just directories), I had the idea of adding FUSE block
exports to qemu where you can export block nodes as raw images.  The
best thing is that youâ€™d be able to mount an image on itself, so
whatever format it may be in, qemu lets it appear as a raw image (and
you can then use regular tools like dd on it).

The performance is quite bad so far, but we can always try to improve it
if the need arises.  For now I consider it mostly a cute feature to get
easy access to the raw contents of image files in any format (without
requiring root rights).


This series does the following:

First, add the FUSE export module (block/export/fuse.c) that implements
the basic file access functions.  (Note that you need libfuse 3.8.0 or
later for SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA.)

Second, it allows using FUSE exports as a protocol in the iotests and
makes many iotests work with it.  (The file node is exported by a
background qemu instance to $SOCK_DIR.)

This gives us a lot of coverage for, well, not free (it does take twelve
patches), but for cheap; but there are still some more specialized
things we want to test, so third and last, this series adds an iotest
dedicated to FUSE exports.


Changes from v2:
- Let meson handle the libfuse and feature (lseek) detection
- Rebase on top of vhost-user-blk export
- Patch 2:
  - %s/5\.2/6.0/
  - Renamed init_fuse() to init_exports_table(), so I can add a
    fuse_init() without being too confusing
  - Set max read/write request sizes (using that fuse_init() function,
    and mount options that libfuse still needs for max_read)
  - Run fuse_session_receive_buf() in a loop until something other than
    EINTR is returned
  - Let setup_fuse_export() clean up
  - Unmount and destroy the FUSE session only in fuse_export_delete()
    (after all I/O has settled and thus all references have been
    dropped)
  - Add MAINTAINERS entry
- Patch 3:
  - Don't use bdrv_query_image_info() when all we want is
    bdrv_get_allocated_file_size()
  - Optionally let fuse_do_truncate() require zeroes in the added areas
    (there is one fallocate() case where we don't need zeroes there)
  - Error out if the max read/write request sizes have been exceeded
    instead of (wrongly) limiting the request size
  - Rename fuse_flush() to fuse_fsync(), and let a new fuse_flush()
    invoke fuse_fsync()
- Patch 4:
  - Keep RESIZE permission for growable exports
- Patch 5:
  - Fix two bugs where I forgot to increment the offset when iterating
    over some area
- Patch 17:
  - %s/QEMU_STGD/QSD/
- Patch 18:
  - %s/QEMU_STGD/QSD/
  - Drop superfluous -T from df invocation
