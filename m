Unless I'm mistaken I have that patch in my build (I assume you pulled
that right from your git branch powernv-4.2, which is what I built from)
and that it would still parse and look for the skiboot partition, and
run it. I need something akin to 'hey, shove this at the addr space and
start executing $bios (where bios is either the bottom of the flash in
that addr space or a provided -bios file on the command line).

The final intent after the first 'conversion' flash is that the coreboot
bootblock will reside in the seeprom, akin to current hostboot bootloader=
,
and then pull romstage from the flash over lpc into cache, then after
romstage initializes memory pull ramstage into from the flash over lpc
into ram and start executing that.
