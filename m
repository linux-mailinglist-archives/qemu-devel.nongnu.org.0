This is why I think any new CLI ought to be done in a new binary,
not qemu-system-XXXX. I think it is an easier proposition to
sell to people that this is a clean break if we make it a new
binary. The mere fact the binary exists will make people curious
about it. If we add new stuff to existing binaries, it is
essentially invisible unless you look for it.  Separate binaries
would also make life better for documentation IMHO, as we can
clearly distinguish legacy and modern in the docs. Indeed the
new binary doc shoudl be completely separate, so when people
learn about it, they're not distracted by legacy.

This way, even if we don't delete qemu-system-XXXX for a long time,
the new binary would not be polluted by the legacy cruft, even if
it still exists in some internal places.

Ideally the goal would be that QemuOpts be entirely missing from
any code linked into the new binary. This will be challenging given
some of the places QemuOpts embeds itself. Perhaps we can split some
of the source files to isolate the QemuOpts usage. The block layer
is the biggest challenge here.
