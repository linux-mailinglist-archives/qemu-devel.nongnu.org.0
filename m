That's my point, if we agree on keeping arguments & members non-optional
and ordered, we are doing 50% of the job for nicer automated bindings.

Second half would probably be involving some version information in the
schema.

Did I? Which schema change are you (or I) implying? Versioning the
interface? It's necessary at the client level, unless everything is
dynamic, after introspection, which makes automated static bindings
impractical.

Contrary to what you believe I am not focusing so much on DBus here :) It
took about 200 loc to bind it, effortlessly (compared to sys<->rs
conversion). All it does is to expose the same API we have in the generated
C somehow (similar static types & functions - not all as a{sv} opaque
dictionaries).

It's easy for QEMU to generate a good static binding for C, because the
version always matches. For a client, you wouldn't be able to write a
similar idiomatic API in C, Rust, Python or Go, unfortunately.

Iow, I am not trying to sell DBus, I would like to make it easier to bind
QMP in general. (although I do believe that DBus is a better protocol than
QMP for local IPC, yes. And gRPC is probably better for remoting)

I don't buy that generalization. A very recent protocol in this space, that
aims to be a good low-level RPC on Linux (for containers, cloud etc) is
varlink. (In many ways, we could compare it to QMP, but it lacks some
important features, like events)

varlink does non-optional members and versioning the same way I propose
here, for what I could tell. Although they use JSON, and have similar
transport "benefits", this basic rule allow them to have very decent
automated binding in various languages, without resorting to unorthodox
solutions, ex:
https://github.com/varlink/rust/blob/master/examples/example/src/main.rs
