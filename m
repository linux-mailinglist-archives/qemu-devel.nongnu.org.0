As I said, the first two patches make total sense.  They would be useful
for testing both packed and split virtqueues, for example.  However, I
think the (useful) feature is being misused here.

IIRC -fsdev can be added to the end of the command line and it still
works.  But if you think that is ugly, you can also use g_string_prepend.

Also, looking at future plans for qgraph, adding a generic "plug/socket"
mechanism to QOSGraph was an idea that we couldn't do in time for GSoC.
With that model, virtio-9p would provide a "socket" of type fsdev and
the tests would have to provide a "plug" of the same type.  Likewise
there would be sockets of type disk or network.  QOSGraphEdgeOpts fits
better with that plan, compared to duplicating the devices.
