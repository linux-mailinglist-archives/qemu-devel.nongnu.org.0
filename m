I know a spec change can take time, but has there even been any effort
at all to try to start that action since first discussed a year ago ?

If these race condition issues are supposedly so serious that we need
to do this without waiting for a spec, then what is the answer for the
masses of users running Linux on VMware or HyperV/Azure ?

Daniel
