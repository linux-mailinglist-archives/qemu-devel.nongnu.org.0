Right now I'm to blame: I need to review the infrastructure and its
pattern of use.

Once that's done, the next questions are what level of review we want
for the instances of the pattern, and how to merge the thing.

One way is to split along subsystems boundaries, and ask subsystem
maintainers to merge their part.  Infrastructure has to go first, of
course.  That would be my job as error subsystem maintainer.  Getting
everything merged via pretty much every subsystem we have will likely be
a drawn out affair.

Another way is to go ahead and merge everything, damn the torpedoes.
