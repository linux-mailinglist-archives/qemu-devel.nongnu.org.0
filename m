In a traditional SELinux approach, the SELinux context used for any
process is determined by a combination of the label on the binary
and a transition rule.

eg if the qemu-system-x86_64 file is labelled qemu_exec_t, and
there's a context qemu_t for the QEMU process, a transition
rule is defined  "virtd_t + qemu_exec_t ->  qemu_t". This says
that when a process with context "vird_t" execs a binary labelled
qemu_exec_t, the new process gets qemu_t.

We sVirt, however, we can't rely on automatic transitions, because
we need to assign a unique MCS tag for each VM. Thus libvird will
explicitly tell SELinux what label to apply.

In the case of multiprocess QEMU, if using sVirt from libvirt, then
we'll need to continue setting the explicit labels as we'll still
need the MCS tags for each helper process.

If not using libvirt and sVirt, and wanting automatic SELinux
transitions for QEMU helper processes, then each helper would
need to be a separate binary on disk so that each helper can
be given a distinct file label, which in turns lets you define
a set of transitions for each helper according to its expected
access needs.

Having said all that I don't think its worth worrying about
this. Anyone who cares about SELinux with QEMU will want to
be using sVirt  or an equivalent approach to assign unique
MCS per VM. And thus automatic transitions are not possible
even if we had distinct binaries for each helper.

Daniel
