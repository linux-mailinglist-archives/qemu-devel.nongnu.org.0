I was in two minds about this, so I'm open to arguments either way.

The primary goal is for libvirt to consume the APIs as soon as possible,
and generally libvirt doesn't want todo this is they are declared experimental
via a "x-" prefix. So that pushes me away from "x-".

If we don't have an "x-" prefix and want to make changes, we can add extra
parameters to trigger new behaviour in backwards compatible manner. Or we can
simply deprecate these commands, deleting them 2 releases later, while adding
completely new commands.

If we think the prposed design will definitely need incompatible changes in
a very short time frame though, that would push towards "x-".

So IMHO the right answer largely depends on whether there is a credible
strategy to implement the ideal non-blocking solution in a reasonable amount
of time. I can't justify spending much time on this myself, but I'm willing
to consider & try proposals for solving the blocking problem if they're not
too complex / invasive.

I just don't want to end up having a "x-savevm" command for another 10 years,
waiting for a perfect solution that never arrives because people always have
higher priority items, as apps are clearly able to accept the blocking problem
if the alternative is no snapshots at all.

Correct. It is unrealistic to consider this for soft freeze.

I'd really love to have a solution in 5.2 though, even if it doesn't
solve all our problems. Something that can at least unblock apps that
want to use OVMF with internal snapshots today.

Daniel
