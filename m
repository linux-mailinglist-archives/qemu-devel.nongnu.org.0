That was a consensus we were able to reach when discussing cpu hotplug
QMP interface. If I recall correctly idea was that it should work for
different targets (cpu topology properties target specific) and be
extensible without breaking old mgmt stack  or requiring its update
in lock step.

If implemented correctly mgmt would not only query from QEMU/machine
possible CPUs (with properties and valid values needed to plug it in,
which it does already) but also 'keep' them around and pass back to
device_add. In that case it would have worked as designed just fine.

But this also shows a problem that we still need versioned machine type
to keep old set of properties for old machine types anyway and we can
miss it during review as tests we have might be not enough
(tests/cpu-plug-test didn't detect it for some reason).
