I feel that both of these approaches are equally broken, as they don't
honour the order in which arguments are passed by the caller when
creating resources.

This leads to the crazy hacks we have with -object where we have to
create certain objects at certain stages.

To make QEMU CLI parsing sane we need to be able to create objects as
we parse them.

   while (n++ < argc) {
        switch (argv[n]) {
           case QEMU_OPT_foo:
             ...parse argv[n]...
             ...create argv[n]...
        }
   }

IOW, all usage of 'qemu_opts_foreach' should be targetted for complete
elimination.

I'm not convinced that your proposed change takes us in direction, if
anything it is encoding the current split of parsing vs creation even
more strongly.

Daniel
