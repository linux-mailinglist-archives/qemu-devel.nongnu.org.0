I spent 1 more hour installing the CodeScape MIPS SDK, even trying to
install it in a Docker image to have it handy or use it in some CI.
However I reached the end of the spare time I could spend trying to
help, and nobody from the community is complaining except your customer.

Since 11 days passed and you haven't replied to my extensive testing, I
am assuming you could figure out how to help your customer with the
other answers to this thread.

Regards,

Phil.
