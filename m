Hm... we could have a property that accepts bits indicating where the
actual limitation lies. Different parts of the code could then make
more fine-grained decisions of what needs to be done. Feels a bit
overengineered today; but maybe there's already stuff with different
semantics in the pipeline somewhere?

Yuck.

We still need to provide the cpu feature to the *guest* in any case, no?
