Thanks for your review. I have considered using the `qom-set` command to modify
IOThread object's properties, however, this command is not friendly to primary
users. The help info for this command is only:

    qom-set path property value -- set QOM property

It's almost impossible to get the correct `path` parameter for primary user.

This patch provides a more convenient and easy-use hmp&qmp interface to modify
these IOThread properties. I think this patch still has a little value.

And I can implement this patch compactly by reusing your code.

Waiting for your reply.
