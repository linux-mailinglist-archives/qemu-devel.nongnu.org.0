Using meson for submodules too is potentially appealing, as you can
then take advantage of Meson's subproject support. This makes it easy
for distro vendors to turn off building of the bundled pieces in favour
of the distro provided equivalent.

I was never entirely happy with the trace.h stuff even in "make".
Trying to maintain the "trace.h" name for every generated header
was probably a mistake in retrospect. it caused me so much pain
trying to get the "make" rules correct so that we resolved the
right trace.h in each case. I was deperately trying to avoid
updating the #include lines, but I'm not sure it was worth
it in the end. Would have been easier to just generate a unique
header file name for each dir and update the #includes.

Daniel
