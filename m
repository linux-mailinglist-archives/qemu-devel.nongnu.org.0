This ignores so much of what I tried to achieve in my example :(

That's not a reasonable thing to express anyway, how can you be certain
that v3 won't break compatibility with v2?  Sean proposed a versioning
scheme that accounts for this, using an x.y.z version expressing the
major, minor, and bugfix versions, where there is no compatibility
across major versions, minor versions have forward compatibility (ex. 1
-> 2 is ok, 2 -> 1 is not) and bugfix version number indicates some
degree of internal improvement that is not visible to the user in terms
of features or compatibility, but provides a basis for preferring
equally compatible candidates.

As you indicate, the vendor driver is responsible for checking version
information embedded within the migration stream.  Therefore a
migration should fail early if the devices are incompatible.  Is it
really libvirt's place to second guess what it has been directed to do?
Why would we even proceed to design a user parse-able version interface
if we still have a dependency on an opaque interface?  Thanks,

Alex
