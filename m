I encounter most of the bugs in different OS boot scenarios.

We also have internal tests that include some computational, disk, and 
network interaction tasks.

Is it possible to add a test like booting a "real" OS and replaying it?

We release the lock, because accessing the replay module may process 
some events and add more timers.

QEMU_LOCK_GUARD looks nice. But we'll still need unlock/lock pairs 
around checkpoint and timer callback.
