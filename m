Quite a bunch of users use something like old = atomic_read(..), where
atomic_read is documented as in docs/devel/atomics.rst:
- ``atomic_read()`` and ``atomic_set()``; these prevent the compiler from
  optimizing accesses out of existence and creating unsolicited
  accesses, but do not otherwise impose any ordering on loads and
  stores: both the compiler and the processor are free to reorder
  them.

Maybe I should have used that instead of volatile, but my problem was
that I didn't fully understand what atomic_read() does, and if it does
more than we need. I found the documentation just now.

Another bunch uses constants as old, which is also fine. And there is
a third bunch where I don't know whats up, partly because I did not
dig deep enough.

Regards,
Halil
