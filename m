Could we make this usecase / workflow independent of the new
CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD command please?

I'd like to suggest the following:

(1) I think we can drop the (x86) restriction. (Because, we don't need
to depend on APIC ID specifics; see below.)

OK thus far.

(2) Can we please store command 0 here
(CPHP_GET_NEXT_CPU_WITH_EVENT_CMD)?

That might change the selector value, yes. (Even if that happens, the
new selector will be *valid*.)

But the main point is that, with 0 stored to the command register, one
of the following *four* cases will hold, subsequently:

(2a) if register block is totally missing:

--> Offset#0 will read as all-bits-one (unassigned read)

(2b) if register block is legacy-only:

--> Offset#0 will read as nonzero, due to CPU#0 being always present

(2c) if the modern register block is active, but the "Command data 2"
register is *not* yet described in the spec file:

--> Offset#0 will read as zero, because it is *reserved*:

> read access:
>     offset:
>     [0x0-0x3] reserved <---- HERE

(2d) if the modern register block is active, and the "Command data 2"
register *is* described in the spec file:

--> the "Command data 2" register (at offset#0) will read as zero,
because:

> read access:
>     offset:
>     [0x0-0x3] Command data 2: (DWORD access)

>                      (n x86 case: 0x0)
>                   other values: reserved <------ HERE

and then step#4 applies just the same:

because "read value is 0x0" corresponds to the *union* of cases (2c) and
(2d) -- namely, "the modern register block is active".

My proposal above is what I implemented for OVMF in October:

  [edk2-devel] [PATCH v2 3/3]
  OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: rewrite MaxCpuCountInitialization() for CPU hotplug

  http://mid.mail-archive.com/20191022221554.14963-4-lersek@redhat.com

and it works very well.

So the benefits would be:

- I wouldn't have to rewrite that (complex!) patch :) ,

- the logic would not store the new CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD command, only
  read offset#0,

- the logic would not be x86 specific (it would not have to rely on the
  most significant 32 bits of the 64-bit arch-specific CPU identifier --
  here: the APIC ID -- being zero).

Furthermore,

(3) In step#4, I suggest replacing 'Command data 2' with "offset 0",

(4) finally, I'd suggest squashing this patch (updated as requested
above) into patch "acpi: cpuhp: spec: add typical usecases".

Using my suggestion (2), you can define the "modern interface
enablement" workflow as well, without any dependency on
CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD. The only thing that's necessary is the small update
from (3), and then you can describe all three important use cases in one
go, in patch#6.

And then you can introduce CPHP_GET_CPU_ID_CMD in the last patch
(patch#7), while staying compatible with the previously-documented
workflows.

Pretty please? :)

Thanks!
Laszlo
