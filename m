That was v8, followed by v9.  We're clearly converging.  However, the
soft freeze is tomorrow already.

You've persevered with this idea for quite a while; some impatience
would be quite excusable now.  Still, I doubt part I making 5.0 matters.
The hand-written part is likely to rebase easily, and the generated part
should be regenerated instead of rebased anyway.

What actually matters is *finishing* the job.  What does that take?

* Consensus on the hand-written part.  I think we're basically there, we
  just want to work in a few more tweaks.

* Split the generated part into reviewable batches, regenerating patches
  as necessary.  Solicit review.  First batch is part of this series,
  and v9 looks ready to me.  I assume you'll prepare the remaining
  batches.

* Queue up batches as they become ready, post pull requests.  I can do
  that.

* Update the QAPI code generator to the new Error usage.  I can do that.
