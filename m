Allowing -b without -F when the backing file probes as raw is safe, but 
yes, I agree qemu-img create should start a deprecation period of 
warning if -F is omitted, and turn it into a hard error when enough time 
elapses.

Now there's an interesting thought.  Since data corruption occurs when 
there is disagreement about which mode to use, getting libvirt out of 
the probing business by deferring all decisions to qemu-img info is a 
smart move - if qemu says an image probes as qcow2 (in an environment 
where probing is safe), then libvirt passing an explicit qcow2 to qemu 
for guest usage (in an environment where probing is not safe) will at 
least see the same guest-visible data.  Less code to maintain in 
libvirt, and no chance for a mismatch between the two projects on which 
format a probe should result in.
