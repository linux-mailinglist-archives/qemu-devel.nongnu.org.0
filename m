There are still quite a bit of pages that either contain hardly any
usable information or are completely outdated. Paolo, Stefan, may I ask
you to check whether the following pages could be deleted? I don't have
access rights to delete a page, so if you agree that they are mostly
useless, please go ahead and delete them:

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/40p :
  only few infos here, and 40p is merged already

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/PRePCleanup :
  prep machine was removed some time ago, 40p is the replacement

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/BeBox
  old project from 2010, never got merged AFAIK

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Documentation/interop
  that has been superseded by:
  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/interop/index.html

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Documentation/specs
  that has been superseded by:
  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/specs/index.html

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/DriveRefactoring
  Out of date, we've got -blockdev now (and not -blkdev)

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/LegacyRemoval
  Has been replaced by the "deprecated features" section in our docs

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Machines/Edison
  old project from 2015, never took off AFAIK

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/LibvirtWiresharkDissector
  seems to be a libvirt proposal - IMHO should not be in the QEMU wiki

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Tegra2
  old project, AFAIK never got merged

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/Version3.0
  Old suggestions for QEMU version 3.0 ... we're close to 5.1 already

- https://wiki.qemu.org/KeySigningParty2013
  https://wiki.qemu.org/KeySigningParty2014
  https://wiki.qemu.org/KeySigningParty2015
  Only some few old information here, useless nowadays?

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/network_reentrant
  Old ideas from 2013 ... I think vhost-net superseded this?

- https://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/Relicensing
  I think this has been completed. The page looks very outdated now.

- https://wiki.qemu.org/SecurityProcess
  Should be replaced with a redirect

 Thomas
