I see that mail, but I don't think it addresses my point.

We already use GLib and it provides a bunch of data structures,
objects and APIs, alot of which will overlap with C++ standard
library, not to mention QEMU's own stuff that predates GLib.

The guidelines say what we want to use C++ for which fine, but
it doesn't help maintainers/reviewers evaluating whether the
proposed C++ usage is desired.

Do we prefer GLib APIs and data structures for consistency &
interoperability with remaining C-only code, or do we prefer
the libstdc++, or do we allow both but set rules on when
to use each, or do we allow a free-for-all with author or
reviewer deciding based on their personal preference.

If we don't have a policy for C++ feature usage, then we
get the free-for-all by default. May be that is OK, maybe
not. Either way we need to declare our intent, so reviewers
know what to complain about and what to not.

Personally I'm not a fan of having a codebase with many
different APIs/data structures for doing the same job,
so would like a clear policy for what to use / prefer,
ideally one we can enforce with tools rather than rely
on humans to spot.

I was particularly considering Ceph when I wrote the above, which
is bigger, but still a similar order of magnutude in size compared
to QEMU, but in Fedora Ceph takes 12 hours to compile on the slower
arch, vs QEMU's 3 hrs, or 3 hrs on x86_64 vs QEMU's 1 hr. Maybe I'm
being mistaken in blaming C++ in general, and it is something else
Or maybe certain features trigger this slowness and we can consider
if we should stay away from them

With regards,
Daniel
