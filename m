I just wanted to follow up since it has been a little over a week
since I submitted this and I haven't heard anything back. It looks
like the linux-headers patches can be dropped since the headers appear
to have been synced. I was wondering if I should resubmit with just
the 3 patches that are adding the functionality, or if this patch-set
is good as-is?

Thanks.
