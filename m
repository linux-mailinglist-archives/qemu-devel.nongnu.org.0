I don't mean we necessarily should enable IR for
kernel-irqchip=on too.  I'd just prefer the default setting to
not depend on the kernel-irqchip option.

x86-iommu could either have intremap=on as the default (and
refuse to run with kernel-irqchip=on without explicit
intremap=off), or simply default to intremap=off.

But as Paolo indicated elsewhere, this is not the only guest ABI
difference between "on" and "split".  Probably it's not worth the
hassle to try to to untangle this.
