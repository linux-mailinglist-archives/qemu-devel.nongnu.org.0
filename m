Tooling can help with typing JSON.  Mature tooling for editing JSON
files exists.  I'm not aware of such tooling for interactive use of
JSON.  It certainly could be made.  qmp-shell tries to help by
"improving" the JSON syntax, half-heartedly.  I doubt that's a good
idea.

Kubernetes went the "put complex configuration into files, use the
mature tooling for editing files" route.  I think we can call that a
success.

The fact that JSON is not meant to serve as configuration file format /
command language for human users bears repeating.  It's a data
interchange format.

Kubernetes supplemented JSON (adequate for machines) with YAML (more
pleasant for humans, I guess).  I'm no friend of YAML myself (too much
syntax, not enough types), but once again, I think we can call that a
success, at least for Kubernetes.

Me neither.

The connection overhead may matter for non-interactive uses.  These are
better off without a middleman.
