Let me re-iterate the difficulties quickly:

- DMA-based fw_cfg is troublesome in SEV guests (do you want to mess
with page table entries in AML methods? or pre-allocate an always
decrypted opregion? how large?)

- IO port based fw_cfg does not support writes (and I reckon that, when
the *OS* handles a hotplug event, it does have to talk back to QEMU)

- the CPU hotplug AML would have to arbitrate with Linux's own fw_cfg
driver (which exposes fw_cfg files to userspace, yay! /s)

In the phys world, CPU hotplug takes dedicated RAS hardware. Shoehorning
CPU hotplug into *firmware* config, when in two use cases [*], the
firmware shouldn't even know about CPU hotplug, feels messy.

[*] being (a) SeaBIOS, and (b) OVMF built without SMM

> I just don't see why we should spend our time doing that now.

I have to agree, we're already spread thin.

... I must admit: I didn't expect this, but now I've grown to *prefer*
the CPU hotplug register block!
