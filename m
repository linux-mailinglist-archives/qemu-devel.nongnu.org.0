I don't think this is a good advice. Yes, at first glance, that would make
the submitter's job easier - since he could divide the whole code into
parts practicaly arbitrarily - but the resulting series will be of
suboptimal quality. If the submitter was forced from the outset to add
segments of his solution so that each step actually (not only ostensibly)
compiles, he would also be forced to organize patches in much more coherent
way, organize his code in much more modular way, possibly improve initial
organization, additionally making reviews much easier.
