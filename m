Indeed. So definitely a reason to split this change to a separate patch=20
(and/or fix the code to finally implement it)

Okay, v2 will have a better commit message.

Indeed - any time that you worry that an interaction of multiple changes=20
might fail half-way through, you can always serialize those changes=20
yourself instead of hoping the tool sequences them correctly ;)

Too true !
