I completely agree we could do this.  I just think this misses
completely the point of this series, because usability of:

  -object memory-backend-file,...,share=3Don,id=3Dmem -m ...,memdev=3Dmem

is not much better than the usability of:

  -object memory-backend-file,...,share=3Don,id=3Dmem -numa node,memdev=3Dm=
em
