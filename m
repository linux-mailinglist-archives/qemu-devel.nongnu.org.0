I am not the maintainer who will merge the AVR port, so I'm not an=20

As noted in the cover, this is sent as RFC and I was quite tired when=20
posting so the documentation is rather scarce, but the patches were=20
targeted at Michael/Joaquin as example how they could properly add AVR=20
machines.

These patches try to do the same as the 'sample' machine modeled by=20
Michael, but reordered in a different way.
The only documentation was "The CPU is an approximation of an=20
ATmega2560" so I assumed he could be using the Arduino MEGA2560 board=20
which matches. I used the same peripherals that Michael used, simply=20
presented a more QEMU-up-to-date way.

If we merge the 'sample' board, the deprecation process will take at=20
least 8 months, hoping no-one start to hack it.

So to save time, we can merge the architectural part (target/avr) of=20
Michael work, without the hardware part (hw/avr).

Michael/Sarah can still test their 'instruction-tests' [*] suite using=20
the 'none' machine.

See this example which creates a testing machine with a AVR3 core and=20
1MB of RAM mapped at 0x0000:

$ avr-softmmu/qemu-system-avr -M none -cpu avr3-avr-cpu -m 1 -S -monitor=20
stdio
QEMU 4.1.93 monitor - type 'help' for more information
(qemu) info mtree
address-space: cpu-memory-0
   0000000000000000-ffffffffffffffff (prio 0, i/o): system
     0000000000000000-00000000000fffff (prio 0, ram): ram

(qemu) info qom-tree
/machine (none-machine)
   /unattached (container)
     /ram[0] (qemu:memory-region)
     /sysbus (System)
     /system[0] (qemu:memory-region)
     /io[0] (qemu:memory-region)
     /device[0] (avr3-avr-cpu)
     [...]

They won't be able to run the FreeRTOS test suite [*] until we find a=20
consensus with the AVR hardware/boards.

This seems the clever outcome, so the AVR architectural part get merged=20
as soon as 5.0 opens, and we have time to improve the hardware part.
And Michael won't have to repost his series until v42 :)

Richard, you seem to be the de-facto maintainer, is that correct?
If you agree with my suggestion, I can prepare a v38 based on Michael's=20
last series, sanitized and without the HW part, so it you can queue it=20
for avr-next.
