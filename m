We can, but the price is that:
1) we won't allow blockjobs and anything blockdev-related because node
name would be out of our control. This was possible in pre-blockdev era.
2) we will lose control of actually telling qemu to NOT open the backing
file in that case. Distros using only unix permission still have
arbitrary file access under permissions of the qemu process.
3) weird special-case code, because we need to keep some metadata about
the image to do security labelling

Now we are back in the teritory where we actually do match what would
happen with previously. We don't specify these on the command line with
ehaviour matching what's described above, with the caveats as above.

I kept this behaviour because we couldn't do better. This is in place
even now if the last introspectable image has valid format specified.

We can reconsider how to approach this but ideally separately.

Well, in this case I'm actually for re-considering the original patch
discussed here. It uses image-format-probing code from libvirt, to allow
the most common cases which were forbidden in a safe way. This means
that as long as we can probe the image and the probed image does not
have a backing file we allow the startup.

It restores previous behaviour for valid cases including blockjobs,
correctly revokes invalid cases (existing chain after image wihtout
format, images impossible to introspect), is limited to the backing
store walking code so can be contained and the price is doing the image
format detection using libvirt's code.
