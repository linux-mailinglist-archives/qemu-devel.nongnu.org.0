Ah I see the point.  And indeed I can't think of a better way now
(e.g., maybe I will always try to use GTrees with malloc()ed keys to
be simple when I want to migrate a gtree, but yeah that's not a reason
to refuse this patch :).

Though we should be very careful on defining vmsds for GTrees in the
future with the help of this patch, and we must have the type (either
direct or not) to match the real usage of the tree otherwise QEMU can
potentially unreference the constant as a pointer.

Yeh it's fine to use direct keys.  Though my question was more about
"unsigned int" - here when we put, we cast a pointer into unsigned
int, which can be 2/4 bytes, IIUC.  I'm thinking whether at least we
should use direct cast (e.g., (uint32_t)ptr) to replace
GPOINTER_TO_UINT() to make sure it's 4 bytes.  Futher, maybe we should
start with uint64_t here in the migration stream, otherwise we should
probably drop the high 32 bits if we migrate a gtree whose key is 64
bits long (and since we're working with migration we won't be able to
change that in the future for compatibility reasons...).

Summary:

Maybe we can replace:

    qemu_put_be32(f, GPOINTER_TO_UINT(key)); /* direct key */

To:

    qemu_put_be64(f, (uint64_t)key); /* direct key */

And apply similar thing to get() side?

Thanks,
