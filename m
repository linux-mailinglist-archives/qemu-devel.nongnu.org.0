Well, I don't actually know if that would be completely unreasonable.
The idea was obviously to keep graph changes restricted to very specific
cases to avoid nasty surprises like triggering latent bugs. Meanwhile we
have quite a few more operations that allow changing the graph.

So if preventing some cases gives us headaches and is probably more work
than dealing with any bugs they might reveal, maybe preventing them is
wrong.

I'm just afraid that we might be overengineering this and waste time on
things that we don't actually get much use from.

WRITE is probably the more practical problem, though it's technically
the correct one to take.

CONSISTENT_READ is already a problem in theory because replacing a child
node with different content doesn't even match its definition:

    /**
     * A user that has the "permission" of consistent reads is guaranteed t=
hat
     * their view of the contents of the block device is complete and
     * self-consistent, representing the contents of a disk at a specific
     * point.
     *
     * For most block devices (including their backing files) this is true,=
 but
     * the property cannot be maintained in a few situations like for
     * intermediate nodes of a commit block job.
     */
    BLK_PERM_CONSISTENT_READ    =3D 0x01,

Replacing an image with a different image means that the node represents
the content of a different disk now, but it's probably still complete
and self-consistent.
