The only thing it really has to care about is the distinction between
a listener socket and a data socket.

This is explicitly everywhere we use sockets in QEMU - it is part
of the SocketAddress QAPI schema.

Consider an address "::", this is an IPv6 address, but depending on
how you configure the socket it can accept either IPv6-only or both
IPv6 and IPv4 incoming connections.

If passing a hostname instead of a raw address, then  the ipv4/ipv6
flags control whether we use all the returned DNS entries.

The naming I use here is determined by the QAPI 'SocketAddress'
struct which has a 'type' field, and separate 'ipv4' and 'ipv6'
flags.

The hard bit is always the backwards compatibility for existing usage....

"local" as in local to the process, rather than "local" as in
local to the host.

At the CLI parser side we'd just do translation to the new QAPI style
usually, but I'm not sure how to handle the existing QAPI stuff though.

Perhaps just add new fields to "NetdevSocketOptions" and deprecate
existing ones that become obsolete.

The only other alternative is a parallel type to completely obsolete
NetdevSocketOptions, but I'm not sure what we'd call that.

I had added Markus / Eric to CC to get advice on QAPI side here..
