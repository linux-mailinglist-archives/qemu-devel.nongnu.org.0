Thinking and writing in the "Making QEMU easier for management tools and
applications" monster thread have made me realize we're mixing up two
aspects that ought to be kept separate: machine-friendly QMP and
human-friendly CLI.

You argue that

    $ qemu-img amend -o encrypt.keys.0.new-secret=3Dsec0 test.qcow2

is nicer than

    $ qemu-img amend -o encrypt.keys.0.state=3Dactive,encrypt.keys.0.secret=
=3Dsec0 test.qcow2

and you do have a point: humans want their CLI terse.  Redundancy is
unwanted, except perhaps to protect users from dangerous accidents.  In
this example, state=3Dactive is redundant when a secret is given, because
anything else would be an error.

In QMP, however, we like things simple and explicit, and we eschew
magic.

This particular magic might just be simple enough to be acceptable in
QMP.  We'd "merely" have to support explicit defaults in the schema (a
clear improvement if you ask me), and optional union tags (tolerable as
long as the default comes from the schema, I guess).

My point is: QAPI schema design *must* focus on QMP and nothing else.
If we try to serve both QMP and human-friendly CLI, we'll likely botch
both.

I believe a truly human-friendly CLI requires more than just
human-friendly concrete syntax for QMP.  Same as HMP, really.
