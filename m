Thanks for having a look!

Yes!

Only the used space. Resizing triggers a resize of the memory region. That =
triggers memory notifiers, which remove the old kvm memslot and re-add the =
new kvm memslot. (That=E2=80=98s existing handling, so nothing new).

So KVM will not see PROT_NONE when creating a slot.

That should work as expected. Resizing *while* kvm is running is tricky, bu=
t that=E2=80=98s not part of this series and a different story :) right now=
, resizing is only valid on reboot/incoming migration.

Yes, memory listeners get triggered. Old region is removed, new one is adde=
d. Nothing changed on that front.

The issue with ram block notifiers is that they did not do a =E2=80=9Eremov=
e old, add new=E2=80=9C on resizes. They only added the full ram block. Bad=
. E.g., vfio wants to pin all memory - which would fail on PROT_NONE.

E.g., for HAX, there is no kernel ioctl to remove a ram block ... for SEV t=
here is, but I am not sure about the implications when converting back and =
forth between encrypted/unencrypted. So SEV and HAX require legacy handling=
.

Cheers!
