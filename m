The scenario is as follows:

A user has a disk with 56 spts.
This disk has been already created under a bios that reported 56 spts.
When migrating this disk to QEMU/SeaBIOS, SeaBIOS will report 63 spts
(under LBA translation) - this will break the boot for this guest.

I agree, but this is easily solvable in virtualized environments where =
the
hypervisor can guess the correct LCHS values by inspecting the MBR,
or letting the user set these values manually.

In my opinion SeaBIOS is not the correct place for this change since
=E2=80=9Cenhancing=E2=80=9D the detection of LCHS values in SeaBIOS may =
cause it to
suddenly report different values for already existing guests which rely =
on
LCHS - thus, breaking compatibility.
Much like smbios, acpi and mptables - I believe that the correct place =
to
use MBR guessing is QEMU (which already has one, with some issues)
and pass the guess using fw_cfg - this will allow using the compat =
system
in qemu itself.
