Hello! Peter and Laurent,
Thanks for your kind & rapid reply.

It took long to merge the patch Peter mentioned.
After applying the patch the problem is gone but I found new issue.

When I had tried to test for the first time after making new docker
container it took much longer time.


bash-3.2# time go run test.go
Hello world

real	5m3.516s
user	5m48.696s
sys	13m32.600s
bash-3.2# time go run test.go
Hello world

real	0m1.784s
user	0m2.339s
sys	0m1.742s
bash-3.2# time go run test.go
Hello world

real	0m1.881s
user	0m2.302s
sys	0m1.926s
bash-3.2# pwd

I believe that 5 min for just printing "Hello world" is not your
expectation.

Is it also known issue?
Please check it.

Thanks.

Title:
  cannot run golang app with docker, version 17.09.1-ce, disabling core
  0 and qemu-arm, version 2.7.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello!
  I figure out that sometimes simple go application is not working.
  I am using docker + qemu-arm + go( for armv7l).

  These are version info below.

  root@VDBS1535:~# docker -v
  Docker version 17.09.1-ce, build 19e2cf6

  bash-3.2# qemu-arm --version
  qemu-arm version 2.7.0, Copyright (c) 2003-2016 Fabrice Bellard and the Q=
EMU Project developers

  This issue is come only when I disable core 0 using a command below.
  please check "--cpuset-cpus=3D1-55" option.

  sudo docker run --privileged -d -i -t --cpuset-cpus=3D1-55 --mount
  type=3Dbind,source=3D"/home/dw83kim/mnt",destination=3D"/mnt" --network h=
ost
  --name=3D"ubuntu_core1" ubuntu:xenial-20200212

  =

  This is what I have tested in the environment above.

  package main
  func main(){
      for i:=3D0; i<1000; i++ {
          println("Hello world")
      }
  }

  This is one of the error logs have faced sometimes not always.

  bash-3.2# go run test.go
  fatal error: schedule: holding locks
  panic during panic
  SIGILL: illegal instruction
  PC=3D0xc9ec4c m=3D3 sigcode=3D2

  goroutine 122 [runnable]:
  qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  bash-3.2#

  Please check it.
  Thanks in advance.
