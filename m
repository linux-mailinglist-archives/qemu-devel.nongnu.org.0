Alex, thank you for all your comments, and other perspectives that you
always bring to Ahmed's and everyones else's attention. I always imagine
you as a "four-dimensional" engineer for the your unabashed presentation of
out-of-the-box ideas. I actually truly like this, quite often, inspiring
style.

However, it seems to me that this last paragraph is a little unjust
critique, and as if doesn't come from you.

The report is not about a benchmark, it is about a script that does
something. Ahmed never said "we are going to benchmark" anything. The
program in the report is just an example used for illustration.

And, now you say: it is not good for benchmarking. Well, no example is good
for benchmarking, and, again, the report is not about benchmarking. Why do
you mwntion benchmarking at all than? And what is Ahmed supposed to do? To
flood the report with dozens of programs and dozens of tables, thousands of
numbers, find some average - just to illustrate the script?

The variety of test programs will be the subject of future reports.

Otherwise, all intriguing and useful proposals from your side, and many
thanks for them!!

Yours,
Aleksandar
