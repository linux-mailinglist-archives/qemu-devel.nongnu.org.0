First of I should say that this PHY, first borrowed by the mfc_fec.c 
(coldfire ethernet device) from lan9118 (and now by imx_fec.c) is not 
one used on any real i.MX (i.MX6, i.MX7, i.MX31, i.MX25, ...) based 
board that I know of (this particular PHY is embedded n the lan9118 
ethernet device)

It is there because we were in need of a PHY and this PHY needs to be 
simple and more or less standard.

I might have missed something but I am not really aware of way in Qemu 
to swap PHYs for a given ethernet emulator depending on the emulated board.

So here this PHY was just a blind cut and paste of the lan9118.c PHY 
part to get a reasonable working PHY for the FEC/ENET device.

So here the previous value of this register is not really meaningful. It 
is a mix of standard MII defined bits and LAN911X specific bits (for 
which I don't necessarily have definition ).

Here I decided to restrict the implementation of this rather "virtual" 
PHY to only standard defined bits

actually I think, I should have removed a lot more lan911x specific 
bits/registers to get to a really simple/trivial standard PHY.

I am not sure anymore why I added MII_NSR register. It is not present on 
lan9118 ethernet device but it is a standard defined register.

Same reason as the ANLPAR register.
