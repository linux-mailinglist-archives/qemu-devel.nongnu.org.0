Thank you Stefan for the fixes. Once these patches land the upstream
repo I'll pull it into the Arch package and reenable io_uring.

Title:
  Win10 guest unusable after a few minutes

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  On Arch Linux, the recent qemu package update seems to misbehave on
  some systems. In my case, my Windows 10 guest runs fine for around 5
  minutes and then start to get really sluggish, even unresponsive. It
  needs to be forced off. I could reproduce this on a minimal VM with no
  passthrough, although my current testing setup involves an nvme pcie
  passthrough.

  I bisected it to the following commit which rapidly starts to run sluggis=
hly on my setup:
  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/73fd282e7b6dd4e4ea1c3bbb3d302c8db51e4=
ccf

  I've ran the previous commit (
  https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/b321051cf48ccc2d3d832af111d688f2282f0=
89b
  ) for the entire night without an issue so far.

  I believe this might be a duplicate of
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1873032 , although I'm not sure.
