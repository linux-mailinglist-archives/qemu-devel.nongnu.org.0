Description of problem:
Currently, when a iOS device is redirected to a macOS VM, it falls into a
reset-not-found loop.
Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
latest
How reproducible:
100%
Steps to Reproduce:

   1. Connect an iOS device to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (I believe it is the same
   for any distro.)
   2. Connect virt-manager/virt-viewer to a macOS VM through SPICE (I am
   using OSX 10.15 Catalina)
   3. Attempt to redirect the iOS device (iPad in my case) to the VM
   through usb redirection.



Actual results:
For any odd number of attempt, the guest macOS will send a reset to the iOS
device which causes the host to reset the USB connection in the host side.
In the UI, it will be displayed as a successful connection for a few
seconds before it disconnects. After this, the iOS device will reconnect
itself, but via a different device name /dev/bus/usb/x/y+1.
For any even number of attempt, when I select the iOS device in the
virt-manager/virt-viewer UI, the connection will not success and instead a
LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND error will be provided. Then the UI will reload and
get the new device name of the iOS device, falling into the behavior of the
aforementioned odd number of attempt.
Expected results:
The macOS detects the iOS device and connects to it happily.
Additional info:
It seems that this bug has been first identified as in
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100149, for a Samsung Android
device, which the developers of SPICE applied a hotfix in
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spice/usbredir/-/blob/master/usbredirhost/usbredirhost.c#L147.
However, there were no settings available for users to fix it.
A similar bug that also consists of a macOS guest/iOS device pair, but
instead of being usbredir, is usb-host, has been identified and patched in
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/ba4c735b4fc74e309ce4b2551d258e442ef513a5,
which is further modified into
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blame/146aa0f104bb3bf88e43c4082a0bfc4bbda4fbd8/hw/usb/host-libusb.c#L1486.
Following such patch, I have attempted to apply such patch at host-side in
https://github.com/michaellee8/qemu/blob/master/hw/usb/redirect.c (not
correctly formatted currently, pls ignore it atm), however I discovered
that this is not enough since it is also a SPICE issue, which resolves to
virt-manager/virt-viewer.
This is probably a cross-project issue between qemu, spice (usbredir) and
virt-manager/virt-viewer, which would some effort to coordinate a solution.
However a working solution for this problem would probably benefits a lot
of users whom relies on connecting a mobile device into a VM, for purposes
like easier mobile development. Considering the report for the Samsung
Android Device on a PC use case, such issue is probably
cross-OS/cross-device.
