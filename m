The OMAP3 reuse various components of the OMAP1/2.
Although in old shape, the OMAP1/2 are in the codebase and work.
It make sense to me to start upgrading the OMAP1/2 to new QOM standard,=20
then add the OMAP3 missing parts.

The previous recommendations from Peter are still valid:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg636936.html

Or you can use the schema followed by Niek when adding the Allwinner H3:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg662591.html

That is:

- Add tests using old code (booting Linux, network access in guest)
- Add an empty board
- Plug an empty OMAP SoC into the board, add the PoP LPDRAM
- Add a ARM926 core into the SoC
- Add most of the devices as UnimplementedDevice
- Add the interrupt controller in the SoC
- Add the UART in the SoC
- Add the Timers in the SoC
- Try to boot a Linux kernel (UART, TMR, then IRQ tested)
- Add the SD controller in the SoC
- Plug a drive to the SD in the board
- Try to boot u-boot
- You can now start the OMAP2 using a ARM1136 core
- Add the missing UNIMP devices (loop to previous steps)
- Add network controller
- Run tests (booting Linux, network access in guest)
- Remove old code

Very good idea.

Niek, since you recently did the same, do you mind sharing your=20
experience, tell us what was not clear or hard to understand, so we can=20
have a better idea what part of the documentation/process we should=20
improve first, to help and welcome new contributors?
