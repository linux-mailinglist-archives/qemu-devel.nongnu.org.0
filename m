Public bug reported:

Host: Ubuntu 19.10 - x86_64 machine
QEMU version: 3a63b24a1bbf166e6f455fe43a6bbd8dea413d92 (master)

ARMV8.3 pauth is not working well.

With a test code containing two pauth instructions:
    - paciasp that sign LR with A key and sp as context;
    - autiasp that verify the signature.

Test:
    - Run the program and corrupt LR just before autiasp (ex 0x3e0000040066=
0 instead of 0x3e000000400664)

Expected:
    - autiasp places an invalid pointer in LR

Result:
    - autiasp successfully auth the pointer and places 0x0400660 in LR.

Further explanations:
    Adding traces in qemu code shows that "pauth_computepac" is not robust =
enough against truncating.
    With 0x31000000400664 as input of pauth_auth, we obtain "0x55b1d65b2c13=
8e14" for PAC, "0x30" for bot_bit and "0x38" for top_bit.
    With 0x310040008743ec as input of pauth (with same key), we obtain "0x5=
5b1d65b2c138ef4" for PAC, "0x30" for bot_bit and "0x38" for top_bit.
    Values of top_bit and bottom_bit are strictly the same and it should no=
t.
