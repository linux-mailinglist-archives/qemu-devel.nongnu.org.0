Independent of the tracker transition, some feedback to your report:
from what you described so far, the most common cause for the behaviour
you described is a simple file permission issue on host side. Please
check which user your qemu process is running with there, then ensure
that the files you want to be able to access from guest by 9p has the
appropriate file permissions for that user on host side.

If the problem still persists there, then please provide more details
about your configuration, especially an output of some files and their
permissions on host side.

Title:
  Can't write to 9p shared folder with qemu 2.9.0

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When running a virtual machine with qemu 2.9.0 with this parameter for
  sharing a folder:

  -virtfs
  local,id=3Dfsdev1,path=3D$HOME/git,security_model=3Dnone,mount_tag=3Dgit

  then the folder is shared to the VM but in some subfolders I can't
  delete files. The guest system then reports that the file, I want to
  delete, is "no file or folder".

  I've downgraded to 2.8.0 now, which re-enables deleting my files.

  Is this a known bug which will be fixed with a future version?
