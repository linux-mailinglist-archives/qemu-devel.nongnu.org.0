with current QEMU you play with memory sharing using numa workaround

-m 512 \
-object memory-backend-file,id=3Dmem,size=3D512M,mem-path=3D/my/shared/mem =
feature,share=3Don \
-numa node,memdev=3Dmem

also on the list there is series that allows to share main ram
without numa workaround, see
  "[PATCH v4 00/80] refactor main RAM allocation to use hostmem backend"

with it applied you can share main RAM with following CLI:

-object memory-backend-file,id=3Dmem,size=3D512M,mem-path=3D/my/shared/mem =
feature,share=3Don \
-m 512 \
-M virt,memory-backend=3Dmem
