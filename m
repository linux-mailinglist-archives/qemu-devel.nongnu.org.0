The idea looks good to me.

I may refine this part in this way:

     for (w = 0; w < FEATURE_WORDS; w++) {
         FeatureWordInfo *fi = &feature_word_info[w];
         uint64_t match_flags = fi->kvm_exact_match_flags;
         uint64_t host_feat =
             x86_cpu_get_supported_feature_word(w, false);
         uint64_t requested_features = env->features[w];
         uint64_t unavailable_features = requested_features & ~host_feat;
         if (kvm_enabled() && match_flags) {
             uint64_t mismatches = (requested_features & match_flags) &&
                 (requested_features ^ host_feat) & match_flags;
             mark_unavailable_features(cpu, w, mismatches, "feature doesn't 
match host");
             unavailable_features &= ~match_flags;
         }
         mark_unavailable_features(cpu, w, unavailable_features, prefix);
     }

which helps to:
- make "-cpu host,pmu=true,lbr-fmt=0" just work as disable-lbr;
- save a little overhead to get mismatches for non-related FEATURE_WORDS;
- avoid to do mark_unavailable_features twice;

It's true. I have noticed the issue as well and
will follow up to make pmu-enabled guest migratable.

It's invalid to set PDCM=1 w/o CPUID[0xA] since all features
on the PERF_CAPABILITIES are dependent on the enabled guest pmu
(which provides basic event counters to make LBR work).

Thanks,
