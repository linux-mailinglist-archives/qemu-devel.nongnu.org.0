&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks!<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I just compiled the v6 set applied to current master=
 on my G5, Ubuntu 16.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; command line:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ./qemu-system-ppc -L pc-bios -boot c m 512 -M mac99,=
via=3Dpmu \<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -netdev user,id=3Dnet1 -device sungem,netdev=3Dnet1 =
\<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; -drive file=3D10.3.img,format=3Draw,media=3Ddisk \<b=
r>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With no specific cpu set, Mac OS 9.2 hard disk image=
 and 9.2 iso do not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to the desktop, they just hang while still in the op=
enbios window. They<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; need -cpu G4 on the command line to get to the deskt=
op.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.3 installed image boots to desktop.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.3 iso boots to installer<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.4 installed image boots to desktop.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.4 iso boot to installer<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.5 installed image boots to desktop.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OSX 10.5 iso boots to installer<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; So there seems to be a difference between hosts: If =
ran on a G4 host<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is no need to add -cpu G4 to run Mac OS 9.x, while t=
here is when ran on a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; G5 host.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Are there any outstanding issues with this patchset now,=
 or is it ready to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be merged?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing the improved pe=
rformance when testing<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; QEMU on my<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mac Mini :)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Howard pointed to some illogical quirks of command line:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If ran on a G4 host there is no need to add -cpu G4 to r=
un Mac OS 9.x,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while there is when ran on a G5 host.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure if Howard says that this is a consequence of t=
his series<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; though.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; No, that has been an existing issue for a long time :)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Overall, I think this is a very good series - however, I had=
 a number of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; minor<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; objections to multiple patches, that don&#39;t affect (or af=
fect in a minimal<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way)<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; provided functionality - those objections are not addressed,=
 nor properly<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed - but I do think they should be addressed in order=
 to get the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; series<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a better shape before upstreaming.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve had a quick look at some of your review comments, and ce=
rtainly I can see how<br>
&gt; &gt; the earlier revisions have benefited from your feedback. There ha=
s been a lot of<br>
&gt; &gt; positive discussion, and Richard has taken the time to respond an=
d update the<br>
&gt; &gt; patchset over several weeks to its latest revision.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; AFAICT the only remaining issue is that related to the ISA flags,=
 but to me this<br>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t something that should prevent the patchset being merged=
. I can certainly see<br>
&gt; &gt; how the current flags implementation may not be considered techni=
cally correct, but<br>
&gt; &gt; then from your comments I don&#39;t see that it would be somethin=
g that would be<br>
&gt; &gt; particularly difficult to change at a later date either.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The things that are important to me are i) is the patchset functi=
onally correct and<br>
&gt; &gt; ii) is it understandable and maintainable. I would say that the f=
irst point is<br>
&gt; &gt; clearly true (both myself and Howard have spent a lot of time tes=
ting it), and given<br>
&gt; &gt; that I had to delve into these patches to fix the R2 register iss=
ue on 32-bit PPC<br>
&gt; &gt; then I can confirm that the contents of the patches were a reason=
ably accurate<br>
&gt; &gt; representation of the changes described within. And that&#39;s fr=
om someone like me who<br>
&gt; &gt; is mostly still a TCG beginner :)<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; From a slightly more selfish position as the PPC Mac machine main=
tainer, these<br>
&gt; &gt; patches make a significant difference to me in that they reduce t=
he MacOS boot times<br>
&gt; &gt; during everyday testing. Now for someone like myself who works on=
 QEMU as a hobby<br>
&gt; &gt; outside of family life and a full time job, those few minutes are=
 really important to<br>
&gt; &gt; me and soon add up really quickly during testing.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I would really like these patches to be merged soon, since the wo=
rst thing that can<br>
&gt; &gt; happen is that the patchset ends up bit-rotting and then all the =
time and effort put<br>
&gt; &gt; into writing, testing and reviewing the patches by Richard, Howar=
d, David, myself and<br>
&gt; &gt; indeed your review time will all end up going to waste.<br>
