Hm, if I needed to describe what a layer is for me intuitively, I guess
it would be something like each non-filter node on a node chain with all
of the filters directly on top of it?

Depending on which link you follow, you get different sets of layers:
For bs->file, you get the format/protocol layer distinction. For
bs->backing, you get essentially what bdrv_backing_chain_next()
iterates.

In this context (which is talking about COW overlays), I expected the
bs->backing link to apply.

The active layer is then the COW layer that is directly referenced by a
guest device, block job or block export.

That I'm happy to allow you to be lazy in this case is what I wanted to
express with "I'm not saying that we can't make arbitrary restrictions".

I was thinking of something like "is used read-write" at first, but then
realised that write-only is possible, too, so it wouldn't be entirely
accurate...

I don't mind either way.
