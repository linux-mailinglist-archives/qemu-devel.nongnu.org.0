Sounds like a great idea.

I believe this this change may not be cross-compatible between QEMU and
OVMF. OVMF platform code would have to hide the stolen part of the TSEG
from core edk2 SMM code.

If old OVMF were booted on new QEMU, I believe things could break -- the
SMM core would be at liberty to use any part of the TSEG (advertized by
OVMF platform code to the full extent), and the SMM core would continue
expecting 0x30000 to be normal (and distinct) RAM. If QEMU suddenly
aliased both ranges to the same contents (in System Management Mode), I
think that would confuse the SMM core.

We already negotiate (or at least, detect) two features in this area;
"extended TSEG" and "broadcast SMI". I believe we need a CPU hotplug
controller anyway -- is that still the case? If it is, we could use
registers on that device, for managing the alias.

Broadcast SMI is very important for OVMF.

The Platform Init spec basically defines an abstract interface for
runtime UEFI drivers for submitting an "SMM request". Part of that is
raising an SMI (also abstracted).

*How* an SMI is raised is platform-dependent, and edk2 provides two
implementations for synching APs in SMM (broadcast ("traditional") and
relaxed).

In our testing on QEMU/KVM, the broadcast/traditional sync mode worked
very robustly (with QEMU actually broadcasting the SMI in response to IO
port 0xB2 writes), but the relaxed synch mode was unstable / brittle (in
particular during S3 resume). Therefore broadcast SMI is negotiated by
OVMF whenever it is available -- it makes a big difference in stability.

Now, whether broadcast SMI needs to be part of CPU hotplug specifically,
that's a different question. The CPU hotplug logic may not necessarily
have to go through the same (standardized) interfaces that runtime UEFI
drivers do.

I don't have any better idea. We could protect the default SMBASE with a
semaphore (spinlock?) in SMRAM, but that would have to be released with
the owning CPU executing code at the new SMBASE. Basically, what you
say, just "ACK" meaning "release the spinlock".

Thanks,
