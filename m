So, can we summarize?

- in libguestfs we will expose the only parameter called 'blocksize'
- 512 and 4096 are the only allowed values for 'blocksize' for now
- we will reject libvirt XML with values for physical_* and
logical_block_size other then 512 or 4096
- importing disks configuration from libvirt XML we will use logical_block_=
size

Richard, are we fine with that?
