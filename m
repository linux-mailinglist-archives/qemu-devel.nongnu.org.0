The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days (otherwise it will get
closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate the ticket auto-
matically to the new system.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Problems related to checking page crossing in use_goto_tb()

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  The discussion that led to this bug discovery can be found in this
  mailing list thread:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg05426.html

  A workaround for this problem would be to check for page crossings for
  both the user and system modes in the use_goto_tb() function across
  targets. Some targets like "hppa" already implement this fix but others
  don't.

  To solve the root cause of this problem, the linux-user/mmap.c should
  be fixed to do all the invalidations required. By doing so, better
  performance results could be achieved, compared to the case of the
  workaround described above.
