I don't think changing the OS version typically changes the level of
coverage in aggregate.  The new OS may exercise new code paths, but
it will stop exercising old code paths, so most of the time it'll
be net-zero.  The ideal would be to test a representative selection
of both old and new versions but capacity limits.

The only time there's probably a notable difference is if we need to
access to a new type of device that the old OS doesn't have, but
that's relatively rare.

Daniel
