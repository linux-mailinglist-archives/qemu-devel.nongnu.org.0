Well, that's exactly what it is (until we have nested virt, in which 
case
you will be able to add NS-EL2 to the mix).

Sure. But nothing guarantees that the guest is going to register a SDEI
entry point anyway.

Nothing. All the events, including SDEI, are maskable, one way or 
another.

Gavin's approach to inject a SError is probably OK for Linux, given that
it tends to run with PSTATE.A==0. But that's not a guarantee either (if
you take a recursive exception, SError won't be delivered).

The long and the short of it is that there is no way to do what you want
with absolute guarantees on the ARM architecture. It just doesn't exist.
