Thanks for the explanation.  That matches what I had in mind with (1).

Yes.  That was my motivation for asking what the correct behaviour was,
so that I could fix the incorrect one. :)  I suspect that up to this point,
the cloud-hypervisor vhost-user-net backend has only been used with
cloud-hypervisor, and so this incompatibilty with QEMU was not noticed.

Do you think this communicates everything required?
