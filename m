Hi!
I couldn't find any place in the spec that says that completion entries s=
hould be initialized.
It is probably wise to initialize that area to 0 on driver initialization=
, but nothing beyond that.
In particular that is what the kernel nvme driver does.=20
Other that allocating a zeroed memory (and even that I am not sure it doe=
s),=20
it doesn't write to the completion entries.

Thanks for the very very good review btw. I will go over all patches now =
and fix things.

Best regards,
