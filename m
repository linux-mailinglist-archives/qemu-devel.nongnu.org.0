Changes from v5 -> v6

    Migration and DeviceObject Code:
        - load/save/needed functions now check if kvm_enabled before calling
            kvm_get/set and has_feat (respectively)

    QEMU->KVM Code:
        - added kvm_s390_* stubs for get/set functions for TCG compilation

    VCPU Discussion:
        - calculate the maximum allowed cpu entries by taking the SCCB size,
            subtracting the offset where the CPU entries begin, then dividing
            by the size of a CPU Entry struct
        - if the number of CPU entries exceeds the maximum allowed entries,
            print a warning and break out of the loop
        - no longer imposing a reduced CPU max

The data associated with DIAGNOSE 0x318 helps to identify the underlying 
hypervisor level (pre-determined by an internal set of codes), as well as the
guest environment (such as Linux, z/VM, etc). These patches, in tandem with
KVM, allow this instruction to be enabled at the guest level, and also to 
enable migration of this data.

The DIAGNOSE 0x318 instruction is a privileged instruction that is executed by
the Linux kernel once and only once during setup (IPL). This requires 
interception by KVM to handle the instruction call safely. The instruction sets
an 8-byte value corresponding to the environment the control program (i.e.
guest) is running with, as well as what hypervisor it is running on.

An update to the analogous KVM patches associated with this patchset are
forthcoming and I will provide a link to the post as a reply to this chain.

Guest support for the diag 318 instruction is accomplished by implementing a 
device class, a cpu model feature, and adjusting the Read Info struct. The Read
Info struct adjustment coincidentally reduces the maximum number of VCPUs we 
can have for a single guest by one.

The instruction is determined by a Read Info byte 134 bit 0. This new byte
expands into the space of the Read Info SCCB, which also contains CPU entries
at the tail-end of this block of data. Due to this expansion, we lose space for
one CPU entry.

A guest can still run safely with the original 248 maximum CPUs, but will lose
access to the 248th CPU entry, meaning that the hypervisor will be unable to
retrieve any information regarding that CPU (weather this means the guest
will actually run with 247 CPUs when 248 are specified is uncertain to me, but
the guest operates just fine on my end).

A device class is used for this instruction in order to streamline the 
migration and reset of the DIAG 318 related data.

A CPU model feature is added for this instruction, appropriately named diag318,
and is available starting with the zEC12 full model, though as long as KVM can
support emulation of this instruction, we can theoretically enable it for _any_
CPU model. It is recommended to explicitly enable the feature via 
-cpu ...,diag318=on (or via libvirt feature XML).
