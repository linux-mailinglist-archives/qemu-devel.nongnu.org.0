It's very strange to define it as opaque and then proceed to describe
the contents of that opaque string.  The point is that its contents
are defined by the vendor driver to describe the device, driver version,
and possibly metadata about the configuration of the device.  One
instance of a device might generate a different string from another.
The string that a device produces is not necessarily the only string
the vendor driver will accept, for example the driver might support
backwards compatible migrations.

I interpret this as hand waving, ie. the first step is for management
tools to make a good guess :-\  We don't seem to be willing to say that
a given mdev type can only migrate to a device with that same type.
There's this aggregation discussion happening separately where a base
mdev type might be created or later configured to be equivalent to a
different type.  The vfio migration API we've defined is also not
limited to mdev devices, for example we could create vendor specific
quirks or hooks to provide migration support for a physical PF/VF
device.  Within the realm of possibility then is that we could migrate
between a physical device and an mdev device, which are simply
different degrees of creating a virtualization layer in front of the
device.

Agreed.

I'm surprised to see this as well, but I'm not sure if Yan was really
suggesting proprietary software so much as just vendor specific
knowledge.

The version string discussed previously is the version string that
represents a given device, possibly including driver information,
configuration, etc.  I think what you're asking for here is an
enumeration of every possible version string that a given device could
accept as an incoming migration stream.  If we consider the string as
opaque, that means the vendor driver needs to generate a separate
string for every possible version it could accept, for every possible
configuration option.  That potentially becomes an excessive amount of
data to either generate or manage.

Am I overestimating how vendors intend to use the version string?

We'd also need to consider devices that we could create, for instance
providing the same interface enumeration prior to creating an mdev
device to have a confidence level that the new device would be a valid
target.

We defined the string as opaque to allow vendor flexibility and because
defining a common format is hard.  Do we need to revisit this part of
the discussion to define the version string as non-opaque with parsing
rules, probably with separate incoming vs outgoing interfaces?  Thanks,

Alex
