Hmm good point. For backwards migration this could indeed be an issue.
Making the existence of these commands tied to machine-type should suffice.

Regarding vmx-version, because we haven't changed it yet (only created 
property), we should be fine.
On first patch that changes it, we need to tie it to machine-type as-well.

Ok. Will do.
