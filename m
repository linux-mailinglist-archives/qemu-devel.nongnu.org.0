This why we shouldn't artificially block use of LTO with GCC in
the configure script. It blocks completely legitimate usage of
LTO with GCC versions where it works.

The user can detect if their version of GCC is broken by running the
test suite during their build process, which is best practice already,
and actually testing the result.
