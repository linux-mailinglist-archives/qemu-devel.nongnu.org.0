I think you may give more significance to this comment than it really has. 
I don't know who put it there but maybe was also guessing what really 
happens and it's not really an authorative answer why it behaves like 
that. It seems to come from this commit and not from Genesi/bPlan but 
sounds more like a bugfix from some user:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/arch/powerpc/platforms/chrp/pci.c?h=v3.16.82&id=556ecf9be66f4d493e19bc71a7ce84366d512b71

I give more credibility to what MorphOS expects because the developers of 
that were closely cooperating with the board designers:

Yes but the fixup is clearing the bits saying the controller is in native 
mode so code detecting IRQ lines later will use the legacy 14 and 15 
because that decides based on this config value. This corresponds to 
half-native mode, as io addresses are still from BARs not the legacy IDE 
ports as can be seen from the dmesg output about ide addresses. If irq is 
not set to 14, fixup function leaves config in native mode and Linux will 
try to use the single IRQ line set by PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE (which the 
firmware sets to 9) for both channels. This works with Linux both ways as 
long as we emulate the same but doesn't with other OSes which always use 
PCI BARs to access io regs but expect interrupts on 14 and 15 regardless 
of the mode (and they leave it in native mode don't try setting to legacy) 
so I think they just know Pegasos2 has this half-native mode and use that 
without trying to fix up anything. From this I think we know how it works 
on real hardware and this patch tries to emulate that which also seems to 
work with all OSes. What else is needed?

Firmware dumps are also linked from

https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/wiki/SubprojectPegasos2

in the section about firmware and also show mode set to 0x8f by firmware 
20040810.

There may be some time until the freeze but not sure I'll have much time 
until maybe Easter or later so I'd rather get over this now if possible 
than do it in the last minute. The feature bit was needed because the 
fulong2e does not seem to have this behaviour (although Linux has a 
different set of fixups for that board but not about IDE IRQs) so we need 
to emulate two different behaviours: half-native mode for pegasos2 (which 
I think is confirmed by evidence in multiple OSes even if we don't know 
the exact reason behind it) and 100% native mode for fulong2e hence we 
need a way to tell the device emulation which board's expectations it 
should fulfil for which introducing a flag seemed to be the simplest 
solution.

I'm not sure either why that's the case but maybe the firmware does not 
use interrupts and MorphOS also only enables it when enabling BMDMA. 
Before that they could just poll the PIO regs?

What other OSes are we interested in running on pegasos2 than Linux, 
MorphOS and AmigaOS? Once these are happy do we need to spend more time on 
this until an actual problem comes up? I think there's no need to further 
refine this relatively rarely used device model now. Unless you can 
propose a better solution that works with these OSes, otherwise that could 
be addressed in a later patch and the current one is good enough to enable 
these guests for now.
