My latest builds of QEMU for Windows still used glib 2.54 because that 
still is the "newest" version which is provided by Cygwin's mingw64:

https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-grep.cgi?grep=mingw64-.*-glib2.0

So I even had to downgrade the minimum glib version.

A hard requirement of a newer glib would mean that Cygwin mingw64 
packages can no longer be used for building QEMU unless someone updates 
those packages.
