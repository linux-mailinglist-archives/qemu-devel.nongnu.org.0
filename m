Sorry, I missed this the first time around.  In retrospect, it looks like we 
ended up with the wrong naming scheme for boards: sifive_e is very ambiguous, 
as there are many boards that look like this.  We'd originally chosen a more 
explicit scheme (something like "sifive-fe310-g000"), but that was NAK'd as 
resulting in too many machine types.

Peter: would you be OK deprecating "sifive_e" and adding "sifive-fe310-g000" 
and "sifive-fe310-g002" targets?  We'll end up with a lot of machines this way, 
but I don't see another way to closely match what's out there.  In embedded 
land there isn't really any runtime portability, so if the memory maps don't 
match exactly then it's not a useful target for users.
