My bad - I should have done a clean build with a version of clang
that doesn't require me to -disable-werror

Yes. I think the sequence could look something like:
CC=clang CXX=clang++ ../configure --enable-fuzzing --enable-sanitizers \
             --enable-werror
make i386-softmmu/fuzz
./i386-softmmu/qemu-fuzz-i386 --fuzz-target=i440fx-qtest-reboot-fuzz -runs=5000

This will run the i440fx fuzzer over 5000 inputs which should finish in
a second or so. I don't expect it to actually find any crashes in the
i440fx in such a short period, so, ideally, all errors would be
fuzzer-related.

Where can I get started with building out a CI job for this?

One aside: running this right now, QEMU exits and AddressSanitizer
complains about some leaks. There is a patch in Paolo's PR that should
fix this, but I was surprised that existing CI tests didn't catch it. Is
leak detection usually disabled in CI?
