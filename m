If we allow QGA to execute arbitrary commands, running those commands
unconfined_t, then what is the point of having any SELinux policy
for QGA at all. It can just execute "/bin/sh" or "/bin/perl", passing
any script commands it wants, having them run as unconfined_t and thus
escape all SELinux confinement of QGA.

I didn't realize that we in fact already allowed runing any command
labelled bin_t. That already makes the QGA policy useless as a security
measure and should be addressed IMHO by putting that existing rul;e
behind a boolean, defaulting to disabled.

With regards,
Daniel
