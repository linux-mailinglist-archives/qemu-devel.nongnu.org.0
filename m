There is some additional information about the 3270 support in our Wiki
at https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/3270 - so let's include this information
into the main documentation now to have one single source of information
(the Wiki page could later be removed).

While at it, I also shortened the lines of the first example a little bit.
Otherwise they showed up with a horizontal scrollbar in my Firefox browser.

 v2:
 - Added the changes that have been suggested by Cornelia
 - Talk about "Linux kernel" instead of just saying "kernel", just in case.
