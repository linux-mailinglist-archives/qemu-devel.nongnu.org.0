Yes.

We already assert ret < 0 explicitly, and we rely on !local_err
implicitly.  Making that explicit is obviously safe.

The code doesn't actually rely on !*local_err.  But when ret < 0, and
!local_err, surely local_err should point to an Error object.  Asserting
that makes sense to me.

That's not a convincing argument.  Doesn't matter as long as we have
convincing ones :)

. Not worth it, I think.

The only change I'd consider in addition to the assertion is this
simplification:
