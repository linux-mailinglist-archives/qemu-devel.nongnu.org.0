Excellent.  If it's useful to have a public discussion before plumbers then the nice
folk at Linaro have been kind enough to host similar discussion in the
past (and deal with posting recordings etc afterwards for those who missed
the live call) and I expect they'd help us out again (Hi Alex ;)

Excellent. A testing expert is always useful. It would be nice to think about
getting something beyond a basic 'does it boot' test into the qemu CI but
I've not really looked into how one might do that.

You are welcome. It's nice to see this work gain traction :)

Anyhow, v9 is on it's way (slowly) through our firewall (got log anti spam
send rate limits) so fingers crossed we are nearly ready with this first bit
of support to build more fun stuff on top of.
