I feel as if I have.

The tests can run on other platforms and I proved that most of them
work. There's not good evidence that any of these tests are indeed
"Linux-only", as only a handful experience problems not more easily
explained by other factors. There's nothing inherent to the framework
itself that makes it Linux-only.

I think it's more than accurate to say that "it's not correct to
prohibit python tests from running on other platforms wholesale."

Maybe you want to talk about whether or not we should gate on these
tests on those platforms, and that's fair, but it's not what got written.

>=20

That's more or less what I want to convey. Enable them and see where the
chips fall, but don't gate pull requests on non-Linux platforms.

In the event that an "auto" group test did fail on an esoteric platform,
I wanted to offer being the point of contact for that so I wasn't
foisting work onto you.

"Royal 'we', but with the expectation that I'd likely just re-blacklist
certain tests we don't have the capacity to support."

I felt like the burden wouldn't be too severe there, as all of the
'auto' tests appeared to pass without much of a fuss.

I don't agree with the sentiment that it's "no good reason".

We claim to support these platforms. If tests fail on them, I think we
rather want to know.

The fear, I think, is that it will be mostly boring platform differences
that are unimportant to the actual functioning of QEMU: that it's just
good at finding bugs in the test instead of the binary.

I think that's a legitimate concern, but it doesn't move me enough to
agree that we shouldn't run tests on platforms we claim to support.

Not that I wanted to wage this war anyway. I just wanted to fix some
Python logging.

Make me "deal with it", is what I meant. I am willing to own
multiplatform problems for the block layer, but I'm also constrained by
some other simple facts like "I don't have a Mac OSX machine."

I am having a difficult time advocating for the idea that we have
supported platforms on which we don't actually test. If we disable tests
for those platforms, I think it's not right to say those platforms are
supported.

I will say, though, you make an extremely convincing case for the idea
that, actually, our only supported platform is Linux.

I'd be OK with not running them in "make check" on non-Linux anymore,
because it matches my feelings on them not being robust enough to gate
on for that platform.

It looks like we're just going to drop the idea entirely, though. As
long as the iotests are getting run regularly I will be happy anyway,
and I suppose we're looking at Travis for that now.

With that in mind, it's probably fine to remove the restrictions here, I
hope. The alternative is working it back the other way and adding new
restrictions to existing tests to force it back to Linux-only, and I'd
prefer not to do that.
