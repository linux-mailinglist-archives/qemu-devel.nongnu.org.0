Sorry, what I meant wasn=E2=80=99t adding a separate =E2=80=9Cdiscard=E2=80=
=9D group, but just
filling in the existing =E2=80=9Cunmap=E2=80=9D fields.  As far as I unde=

had BlockAcctStats for each BDS, the file node=E2=80=99s unmap stats woul=

the same as its discard stats, wouldn=E2=80=99t it?

You can simply make the fields optional.  (Then the first case is
=E2=80=9Cpresent, but 0=E2=80=9D, and the second is =E2=80=9Cnot present=E2=
=80=9D.)

That=E2=80=99s indeed a problem, yes. :-)

Yes, if we put BlockAcctStats at the node level, we should track all
operations, I suppose.  That would require adding accounting code in
many places, so it wouldn=E2=80=99t be easy, correct.

I think it would be the better solution, but you=E2=80=99re right in that=
 it=E2=80=99s
probably not worth it.

But I do think it would be good if we could get away from a
driver-specific structure (unless we really need it; and I don=E2=80=99t =
think
we do if we just make the stats fields optional).
