I don't think any of these three should be required. The problem isn't
the structure of the makefiles or layout of the source, rather it is
a matter of expanding paths correctly in the build rules.

With QEMU's build system, regardless of where the rules are defined,
they should get run in the context of the top level makefile, as all
the sub-dir Makefiles are just includes. The unnest-vars function
takes relative filenames and adds the correct directory prefix to
them.

IIUC, common-obj-m gets  spice-app.mo added. common-obj-m is processed
by unnest-vars, but spice-app.mo-objs is not, so all its .o files are
relative. So we just need to fix the way the *.mo-objs variables are
processed, such that unnest-vars is used to add the directory prefixes.

Daniel
