Yes, I agree wrt probe_write.

Yes, and that's all we care about on s390x.

"In any case, so long as we eliminate *access* faults by probing the
page table" - that's what I'm doing in this patch (and even more correct
in the prototype patch I shared), no? (besides the watchpoint madness bel=
ow)

"falling back to the byte-by-byte loop is, AFAICS, sufficient"

I don't think this is sufficient. E.g., LAP protected pages
(PAGE_WRITE_INV which immediately requires a new MMU walk on the next
access) will trigger a new MMU walk on every byte access (that's why I
chose to pre-translate in my prototype). If another CPU modified the
page tables in between, we could suddenly get a fault - although we
checked early. What am I missing?

I see that we use BP_STOP_BEFORE_ACCESS for PER (Program Event
Recording) on s390x. I don't think that's correct. We want to get
notified after the values were changed.

"A storage-alteration event occurs whenever a CPU,
by using a logical or virtual address, makes a store
access without an access exception to the storage
area designated by control registers 10 and 11. ..."

"For a PER instruction-fetching nullification event, the
unit of operation is nullified. For other PER events,
the unit of operation is completed"

Oh man, why is everything I take a look at broken.

Indeed. I see what you mean now. (I was ignoring the "before access"
because I was assuming we don't need it on s390x)

probe_write() would have to check for all BP_STOP_BEFORE_ACCESS watchpoin=
ts.

Yes, that's what I mean, TARGET_PAGE_SIZE, but eventually crossing a
page boundary. The longer I stare at the MVCL code, the more broken it
is. There are more nice things buried in the PoP. MVCL does not detect
access exceptions beyond the next 2k. So we have to limit it there
differently.

So what I understand is that

- we should handle watchpoints in probe_write()
- not bypass IO memory (especially NOTDIRTY). We cannot always relay on
  getting access to a host page.

Thanks!
