even if its only user is ACPI now, like any other ABI it's
fixed and given that requirements to CPU hotplug ABI from ACPI
and firmware pretty much the same, I don't really see a reason
not to reuse it, since whole hotplug process orchestrated
by ACPI anyway.

Building an alternative ABI that will duplicate already
existing one, doesn't sound like a great idea to me.

Could you elaborate why do you think it's not a good idea
to re-use already existing CPU hotplug ABI in firmware?

Or even better suggest an algorithm how CPU hotplug should
work with SMM enabled OVMF.

 * in generic case, CPUs are asynchronously hotplugged and
   OSMP also asynchronously processing hotplug events.
   (So at the moment OSPM tells firmware to handle hotplug
    there are 1-n CPUs to handle and more might be coming)

it doesn't really matter if it's ACPI blob or fw_cfg,
what firmware needs is a table of possible CPUs with APIC IDs.

But if we go this route (i.e. not reuse CPU hotplug interface),
the table alone is not enough, one would need to build a protocol
between ACPI and firmware to communicate what CPUs to (un)hotplug.
It's basically repeating what current CPU hotplug interface does.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say here.
