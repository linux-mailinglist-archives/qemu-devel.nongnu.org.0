Thanks for the explanation! What about the inactive bitmaps though? Are
they treated the same when opened? Should we consider them for migration
through the migration stream?

Yeah, that's probably going to be what libvirt does as well.

IMO yes. I think it also conveniently sidesteps some of the issues that
were discussed in the other threads regarding addition/multiple calls
etc. The mapping will be set at once and any other invocation sets a new
mapping and that's it. Setting nothing will clear the mapping.
