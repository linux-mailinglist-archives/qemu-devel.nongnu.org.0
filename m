Doing READ/WRITE in QEMU solves the problem that vhost-user slaves only
have access to guest RAM regions.  If a guest transfers other memory,
like an address in the DAX Window, to/from the vhost-user device then
virtqueue buffer address translation fails.

Dave added a code path that bounces such accesses through the QEMU
process using the VHOST_USER_SLAVE_FS_IO slavefd request, but it would
be simpler, faster, and cleaner to do I/O in QEMU in the first place.

What I don't like about moving READ/WRITE into QEMU is that we need to
use even more virtqueues for multiqueue operation :).
