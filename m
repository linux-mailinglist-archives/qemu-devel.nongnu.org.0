Ah, OK.

Yep, I=E2=80=99ve sent a patch:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-02/msg00294.html

I don=E2=80=99t think it makes much sense to let qemu=E2=80=99s NBD server =
ensure that
it claims both IPv4 and IPv6 in case the user specifies a
non-descriptive hostname.

> 2b. Otherwise I can send a v2 that will check the port in the _try_server=
_up just before starting qemu-nbd to minimize the risk of using a utilized =
port (or should you decide it's not worth checking, I can simply forget abo=
ut this)

Hm.  It wouldn=E2=80=99t be fully reliable, but, well...  The risk would be=
 minimal.

OTOH, would it work if we just did a %s/localhost/127.0.0.1/ in the
test?  We have specific cases for IPv6, so I think it makes sense to
force IPv4 in all other cases.
