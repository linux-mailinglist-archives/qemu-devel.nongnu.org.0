Has this ever been fixed on the QEMU or Spice side?

Anyway, the QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking =
to another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and =
which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplet=
e" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.  virt-viewer 8.0.

  Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

  Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using
  integrated ASPEED graphics.

  Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DNyMdcYwOCvY

  Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH3nGG2Mk6i0

  4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.

  Using 4.1.0 with virtio-vga doesn't cause this.
