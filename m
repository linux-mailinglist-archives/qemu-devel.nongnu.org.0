Each time I look at this patch, I'm confused by the function names.
Maybe I should just ask what the idea there was, or more specifically:
What does the "filtered" in "filtered child" really mean?

Apparently any child of a filter node is "filtered" (which makes sense),
but also bs->backing of a qcow2 image, while bs->file of qcow2 isn't.
raw doesn't have any "filtered" child. What's the system behind this?

It looks like bdrv_filtered_child() is the right function to iterate
along a backing file chain, but I just still fail to connect that and
the name of the function in a meaningful way.

Or NULL, if no such child exists.

It's relatively obvious here, but for some of the functions further down
it would be really good to describe in which cases NULL is expected (or
that NULL is even a possible return value).
