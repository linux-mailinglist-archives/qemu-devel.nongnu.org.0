Which is not possible since I'm using internal snapshots.

Yes, and the man page also seems to be wrong. The section on blockcommit 
begins:

blockcommit domain path [bandwidth] [--bytes] [base] [--shallow] [top] 
[--delete]
        [--keep-relative] [--wait [--async] [--verbose]] [--timeout 
seconds] [--active]
        [{--pivot | --keep-overlay}]
            Reduce the length of a backing image chain, by committing 
changes at the top of the
            chain (snapshot or delta files) into backing images. By 
default, this command
            attempts to flatten the entire chain.

In addition to "[base]" actually being "[--base base]" and "[top]" being 
"[--top top]", the description of what it does only applies to external 
snapshots. Similar things are wrong in the blockpull section.

Yes. I'm using internal snapshots. From your other e-mail, I gather that 
the (only) benefit to blockcommit with internal snapshots would be to 
reduce the size of the various tables recording changed blocks. Without 
a blockcommit, the L1 tables get progressively larger over time since 
they record all changes to the base file. Eventually the snapshots could 
become larger than the base image if I don't do a blockcommit.
