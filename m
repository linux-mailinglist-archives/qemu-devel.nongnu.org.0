This is not meant for some long-running job which you have to manage.

Allowing commands being asynchronous makes sense for things which (a)
typically don't take long, and (b) don't need any management.

So, if the connection goes down the job is simply canceled, and after
reconnecting the management can simply send the same command again.

Inside qemu yes, sure.  But for the QMP client nothing changes.
