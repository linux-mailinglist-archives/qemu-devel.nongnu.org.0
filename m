After hours bisecting various QEMU/SeaBIOS combinations, Brad figured
out a new commit:

0a7fa00a13f0852ec6fa83ab987a5ee7978d9867 is the first bad commit
Author: Emilio G. Cota <cota@braap.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 13 20:52:26 2018 -0400

    configure: enable mttcg for i386 and x86_64

Note 1: Brad was not using '-M isapc'.
Note 2: Brad was using the pc-bios/ folder checkout'd at v4.1.0 or 33f18cf7=
dc to avoid the SeaBIOS issues reported previously

Brad could succeed booting QEMU using '-accel thread=3Dsingle' on
0a7fa00a13.

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
