 encountered (and I wouldn't mind a link to the BZ or ticket under which pe=
ople agreed to remove bzip2 from the default package set).

bzip2 is no longer a favored compression.  If we are trying to pick a=20
compression that is most likely to be present on any system, go with=20
gzip.  If we are trying to pick a compression that packs tighter and=20
uncompresses faster, pick xz or zstd.  But bzip2 does neither: it packs=20
slightly tighter than gzip but has slower performance in doing so, and=20
thus is no longer used as a default compression.
