So I think this is OK, because ram_save_complete has a call to
flush_compressed_data in it.

However I think we should hold it until you figure out the other series
that really enables compress; the problem is that as soon as you
allow the capability, then there's nothing to distinguish this version
and the version that fully enables it.  So how would you stop this
version being used as the source to the version which fully enables it?

So I think if we do the other series, then you should start off like
this and then remove the capability check right at the end.
