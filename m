A Make replacement must address its issues to be credible.

Make's traditional inability to directly express "rule updates multiple
files" and "rule may or may not actually change its target(s)" has
always been an issue.  Countless Make users have had to learn the stamp
file work-around, and how to cope with its drawbacks.  I distinctly
remember grappling with it back in the 90s.

This is *essential* when generating headers.  Without it, touching any
QAPI module or any part of the QAPI generator recompiles pretty much
everything.

Yes.  Also, TIL grouped targets :)

Neat trick!

Now I remember the old Makefiles actually didn't recover all by
themselves either, because they didn't use this trick.  Manual recovery
was "easy", though: remove the stamp file.

I ran into the "can't recover from deletion of generated QAPI file(s)"
issue when I updated a silly script of mine that helps me diff them.  To
force regeneration, the script removes them (relying on ccache to keep
compilation time in check).  Pre-Meson, it removed the stamp files.  I
didn't see any in meson.build, so I dropped their removal, nothing
worked, and I got quite confused.

Makes sense to me.

Yes.  Drop in the bucket?

We already depend on ninja-the-language, we just feed it to ninja2make
instead of ninja.

Thank you very much for taking the time to explain!
