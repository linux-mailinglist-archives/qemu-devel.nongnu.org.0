A snapshot is something that reflects the state of something at a
certain point in time.  It does not change.

The file our snapshot commands create (or the node they install) is not
a snapshot, as it does change over time.  It is an overlay.  We cannot
do anything about the parameter names, but we can at least adjust the
descriptions to reflect that fact.
