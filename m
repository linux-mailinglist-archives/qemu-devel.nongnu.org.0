Currrently we target 7.4:

  commit 2a85a08c998e418a46a308095893f223642f6fc9
  Author: Daniel P. Berrang√© <berrange@redhat.com>
  Date:   Fri May 14 13:04:15 2021 +0100

    configure: bump min required CLang to 6.0 / XCode 10.0
    
    Several distros have been dropped since the last time we bumped the
    minimum required CLang version.
    
    Per repology, currently shipping versions are:
    
                 RHEL-8: 10.0.1
          Debian Buster: 7.0.1
     openSUSE Leap 15.2: 9.0.1
       Ubuntu LTS 18.04: 6.0.0
       Ubuntu LTS 20.04: 10.0.0
             FreeBSD 12: 8.0.1
              Fedora 33: 11.0.0
              Fedora 34: 11.1.0
    


Ubuntu 18.04 drops off our list after 7.0 comes out

Buster is already  off our list as that hit the 2 year
mark in AUg 2021.

OpenSUSE Leap 15.2 was EOL'd by SUSE themselves in Jan 2022,
We use it as a proxy for SLES, but I think we can required
SLES 15 sp3.

FreeBSD 12 is something we still support until April 2023,
but arguably we only care about CLang there.

NetBSD 9 wasn't listed, but it was reported to required
GCC 7.4  (commit 3830df5f83b9b52d9496763ce1a50afb9231c998)
and that is still the latest release of NetBSD.

So NetBSD is our biggest constraint on requiring GCC 10

Regards,
Daniel
