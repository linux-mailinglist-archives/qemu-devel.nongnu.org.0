I'm a bit confused by the nomenclature here. VL clearly stands for
Vector Length, but what does VQ stand for? You seem to be using the
two terms pretty much interchangeably throughout the cover letter.

I would personally just error out when both are provided.

I think the proposed QMP command is problematic, because it reports
the valid vector lengths for either KVM or TCG based on which
accelerator is currently enabled: it should report all information
at all times instead, similarly to how query-gic-capabilities does
it.

I don't have a problem with having to use a bitmap internally,
though libvirt will clearly want to expose a more approachable
interface to users.

However, QMP reporting the information in the current format means
we'd have to build an additional parser on top of the bitmap handling
and conversion routines we'll clearly need to make this work; plus it
just feels weird that the information reported by QMP can't be used
on the command line without going through some tranformation first.

Wouldn't it make more sense to both accept and report bitmaps?
