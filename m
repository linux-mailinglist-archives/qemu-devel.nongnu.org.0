I believe so.

I wonder, in the case of non-encrypted reports, it would be better to
suggest that in that case, it would only be an initial contact, no
significant details.

After that some discussion could be done on reproducers, etc on a more
secure list.

AFAIK the original message needs to be encrypted with a specific key,
which is on the website above - so all reporters would be using that.

Maybe, honestly not had to deal with it personally.

The storage of reproducers would indeed be good to have in something
like Gitlab - but that'd require someone to extract it and store it, but
under what naming would be another issue... But really that's behind the
scenes.

Excellent, that would be good.

Hmm, it's here that I think it becomes difficult for everyone to log an
issue, even with an account, you may not be able to log an issue on a
project that is otherwise secured.

I really think that encryption of the details of a vulnerability is
important, if somehow it gets intercepted - which is not that difficult
with e-mail - then there is the potential for a malicious party to
exploit it before a fix is available to distros, and deployed.

Something that has happened since the Intel Spectre/Meltdown
vulnerabilities were initially brought to light is more communication
between security teams in various orgs. To do this those discussions
have started being done on Keybase, which provides secure chats as well
as secured Git repos.

Has anything like that being considered as the point for subsequent
discussions on issues post the initial disclosure?

Thanks,

Darren.
