I'll need to think a bit about this. The basic setup is that we want the
VM to boot into OVMF and initialize the Migration Handler. Then QEMU 
will start
receiving encrypted pages and passing them into OVMF via some shared 
address.
The Migration Handler will decrypt the pages and put them into place,
overwriting everything around it. The Migration Handler will be a 
runtime
driver so it should avoid overwriting itself.

We map the VMSA into the guest because it gives us an easy way to
securely send the CPU state to the target.

Each time there is a VMExit, the CPU state of the guest
is stored in the VMSA. Although the VMSA is encrypted with the guest's 
key,
it usually isn't mapped into the guest. During migration we securely
transfer guest memory from source to destination (the Migration Handler
on source and target share a key which they use to encrypt/decrypt the
pages). If we tweak the NPT to add the VMSA to the guest, the VMSA will 
be
sent along with the all the other pages.

There are some details with the timing. We'll need to force a VMExit 
once
we get convergence and re-send the VMSA page to make sure it's up to 
date.
Once the target has all the pages, the Migration Handler can just read 
the
CPU state from some known address.
