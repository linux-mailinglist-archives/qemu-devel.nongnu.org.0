hi Alex,
could mdevctl serve as a general configuration tool to create/destroy/config
mdev devices?

I think previously the main debate is on what is an easy way for management
tool to find and create a compatible target mdev device according to sysfs
info of source mdev device, is it?
as in [1], we have simplified the method to 1:1 matching of mdev_type
in src and target. and we can further force it to be 1:1 matching of
vendor_specific attributes (e.g. pci id) and dynamic resources
(e.g. aggregator, fps,...) and have mdevctl to create a compatible target
for management tools.

Given management tools like openstack are still in their preliminary
stage of supporting mdev devices, could we first settle down the
compatibility sysfs protocol and treat mdevctl as userspace tool
currently?
