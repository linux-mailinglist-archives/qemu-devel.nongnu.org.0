I don't think we want to expose this in the QAPI schema for the socket
address, since the correct value is really something that QEMU should
figure out based on usage context.

Thus, I think we'll have to make it an explicit parameter to the
qio_channel_socket_listen_{sync,async} APIs, and socket_listen()
and inet_listen_saddr(), etc. Then the migration code can pass in
a sensible value based on multifd usage.

Daniel
