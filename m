The other problem is that blkdebug doesn=E2=80=99t work so well with extern=
al
data files, so basically this whole test doesn=E2=80=99t work.

This is a test of qemu-img compare, not of the image format.  So it
doesn=E2=80=99t make much sense to me to compare the external files, and al=
so it
should be completely sufficient to run this test only without external

This too isn=E2=80=99t an image format test (specifically, there=E2=80=99s =
no I/O but
for the snapshotting test, which mostly uses a different image anyway),
so I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s necessary to allow this test for data=

This isn=E2=80=99t about hardcoded offsets, it=E2=80=99s about the fact tha=

Not really, because this again isn=E2=80=99t really a test of the image for=

I suppose we=E2=80=99d want a different test for data file validation, if

That won=E2=80=99t work, though.  The problem is that in the block graph,
blkdebug just exists between the format and the file node.  You=E2=80=99d n=
eed a
second instance above the external data file node, but then those
instances wouldn=E2=80=99t share data, and qcow2 only issues blkdebug event=
s to
the file node.

One could make qcow2 duplicate all events to the data file, but then you
still wouldn=E2=80=99t share the same state in both instances.

In all, it would just be a mess.

I don=E2=80=99t think so, because this is specifically a test to check thos=

filenames.

But this test too is just an interface test, so I don=E2=80=99t quite see t=

Probably, but I don=E2=80=99t think this test would benefit much from it.
(Because it isn=E2=80=99t too important to be able to run this with an exte=
rnal
data file)

Good point.  I was wondering what the problem was here because I was
sure it didn=E2=80=99t have anything to do with something hard-coded, and i=
t
doesn=E2=80=99t.

The actual reason is simply that there is no refcounting for external
data files.  I=E2=80=99ll fix the comment.

I don=E2=80=99t know, this type of storage migration simply doesn=E2=80=99t=
 work this
way with external data files.
