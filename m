I need a contract.  The difficulty of writing a clear contract, caused
by a case that doesn't actually occur, is what made me limit null bus to
qdev_realize().  I admittedly didn't try hard.  Next try:

    /*
     * Realize @dev and drop a reference.
     * This is like qdev_realize(), except the caller must hold a
     * (private) reference, which is dropped on return regardless of
     * success or failure.  Intended use:
     *     dev = qdev_new();
     *     [...]
     *     qdev_realize_and_unref(dev, bus, errp);
     * Now @dev can go away without further ado.
     */

The common pairings are qdev_new() with qdev_realize_and_unref(), and
object_initialize_child() with qdev_realize().  Your idea obviously
works for these.  Whether there are other uses where it might not work,
I can't say offhand.
