Hmm, good point. Actually fetching the list takes several seconds. A
special command may be preferable.

I am not an expert either, but I don't see any unique identifier. Don't
see anything like that in INF files nor in API.

But another option would be to list the actual hardware and match it by
vendor IDs. Then list the driver name and version that is assigned to
the hardware. The up-side of this would be that one would also notice
situation where there is unsuitable driver (e.g. generic display driver
on QXL device).

The goal is to notify admin when there is old driver in the guest so
that he/she can update.

The "enterprise" solution you speak of is called Windows Update. The
problem is however two-fold. Virtio drivers are not yet available
through Windows Update. While the topic has been on the table for many
years it is still work-in-progress. But even when we get the drivers
into Windows Update, there are administrators who have automatic updates
disabled and prefer to do updates in a controlled manner.
