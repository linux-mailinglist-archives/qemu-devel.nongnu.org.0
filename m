Thank you for your input.

The reason why pvpanic should be MMIO is that is a special device which 
is not used commonly by the user (aka VM), it is not need to be 
hot-plugable and it does not have a hardware correspondent to be a PCI 
device. Another reason is that MMIO support was accepted in the kernel 
driver and it is pretty useless there without a device.

I know it seems that I want to get this on the short-path, but at this 
point having a kernel driver in the upstream and no device to test it 
against it is pretty weird.

Thank you,
Mihai
