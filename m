As long as running QMP commands from *all* monitors one after the other
is good enough, I can't see why running HMP commands interleaved is
worth the risk.

I believe the non-"interactive" HMP code is used only by gdbstub.c.

I keep forgetting our GDB server stub creates an "HMP" monitor.
Possibly because I don't understand why.  Alex, Philippe, can you
enlighten me?

Aside: I figure the distribution of work between monitor_init(),
monitor_init_hmp() and monitor_init_qmp() could be improved.
