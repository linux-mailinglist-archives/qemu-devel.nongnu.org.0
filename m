I'd treat that as a bug.

Bug.

In my opinion, the macro is no clearer than proper comments.

I'd prefer -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3D1 or 2.  The former makes gcc accept
any comment.  The latter makes it accept '.*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).*',
which should still match the majority of our comments.  Less churn than
the macro.

Do we define our own scanf()-like functions?  If yes, decorating them
with the attribute is a good idea.

However, the gnu_ in gnu_scanf tells the compiler we're linking with the
GNU C Library, which seems unwise.  Hmm, we already use gnu_printf.
Commit 9c9e7d51bf0:

    Newer gcc versions support format gnu_printf which is
    better suited for use in QEMU than format printf
    (QEMU always uses standard format strings (even with mingw32)).

Should we limit the use of gnu_printf to #ifdef _WIN32?

Quite some churn, but regularity matters.
