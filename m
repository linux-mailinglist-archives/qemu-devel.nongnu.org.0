Yes, but, while neither direction old -> new nor new -> old is actually
something that people should do when using host cpu passthrough (they
should only ever migrate between identical hosts, both hardware and
host kernel version), migrating from old -> new makes more sense, as
that's the upgrade path, and it's more supportable - we can workaround
things on the new side. So, long story short, new -> old will fail due
to making this change, but it's still probably the right thing to do,
as we'll be defining a better pattern for ID registers going forward,
and we never claimed new -> old migrations would work anyway with host
passthrough.
