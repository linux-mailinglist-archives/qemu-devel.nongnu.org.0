I guess both yes and no, the external data file is a header extension as we=
ll.
I am looking at the tests from the point of view of someone that
doesn't know the qcow2 internally well yet, so I noted all the tests
that looked like they can still catch something.

Same here, in theory external data file is a feature, and it could
'interact' with other features, but most likely you are right here as well.

Yes, I see now that the test uses the blkdebug.

Yes but on the other hand, its is kind of nice to test that it can compare =
correctly
two qcow2 files which have external data files attached.

Same here, I agree but still what if there is some interaction between back=

file and data file?

That true too! In theory, the test could have asked the qcow2 image
where the data clusters are instead.

I think that in the long term, it would add a value to have some kind
of qcow2 specific test framework that would allow to query the qcow2 conten=
ts,
and manipulate it in the out of spec ways. Not now of course.

Oops, I probably meant test 061, which might have a value to be split in=20
two tests, one that upgrades/downgrades the version (and thus indeed can't =
use
any compat=3D1.1 features) and other test that works only on changing featu=
res of compat=3D1.1
images, where it could have used both different refcount bit settings and e=
xternal data file.
(I suppose you can't take a regular qcow2 image and move its data clusters =
to an external data file, but still)

I think I agree on this test now. Still in theory it adds/removes lot of bl=
ock devices,
thus the qcow2 driver now has to open/close the external file, which might =
reveal some bugs.

Well the external data file as I understand is an extension on its own,
so in theory if you put some garbage there, it could reveal some bugs.
What if for example data file points to the same qcow2 file?
(or points through a symlink?) or it is NULL, or whatever.
The test for example tests for 'Invalid backing file size'
I guess that is what you mean here.

I agree. That is more or less what I suspected.
In theory you could make single blkdebug instance have 2 inputs and 2 outpu=
ts
so it could filter both IO channels. Interesting how we deal with backing f=
iles,
since even without data file the qcow2 driver accesses two block devices, a=
nd
with data file it can access 3.

All right!

Looking again, I agree, but like I mentioned earlier, it might be worth
it to have test that fuzzes the backing file location (if we don't have one=
 that is).

I am curios why? The test seems only to use external snapshots, so why it
would be different, other that copying the external files.

I want to note again, that I noted all the tests just in case,
most if not all of them probably indeed are best to be
blacklisted for external files.
