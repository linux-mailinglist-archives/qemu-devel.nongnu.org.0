Other IDE devices such as ahci and cmd646 seem to free it at the end of=20
the init function after calling ide_init2 with it. However it's not clear=
=20
to me how all this is supposed to work. Ahci does for example:

qemu_irq *irqs =3D qemu_allocate_irqs(ahci_irq_set, s, s->ports);
for (i =3D 0; i < s->ports; i++) {
     ide_init2(&ad->port, irqs[i]);
}
g_free(irqs);

So it allocates an array of s->ports irqs then only frees a single=20
element? Also aren't these needed after ide_init2 to actually raise the=20
irq or are these end up copied to the irq field of the BMDMAState sonehow=
?=20
Where will that be freed?

If the above is correct then simply adding g_free(irq) after the loop at=20
end of sii3112_pci_realize should be enough but I can't tell if that's=20
correct. Setting hotpluggable to false does not seem to be a good fix.
