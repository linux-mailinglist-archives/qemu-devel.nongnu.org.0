I guess ideal solution is to implement the missing device emulation, if we 
don't have resources for that effort then that's less than ideal but in 
that case patching the dtb to disable the device does not look too bad to 
me. I think that's an acceptable way to save the effort of implementing 
the device that's not srtictly needed. For sam460ex I think Linux has 
booted so far but displays an error about missing ethernet ports but this 
did not prevent it from booting. So unless recent kernels fail now, this 
patch is only suppresses those errors (and avoid going to code paths in 
guest kernel that probably never run on real hadware). I think there are 
arguments for and against it (the errors look ugly so we could prevent it 
but on the other hand then we have something different than on real 
hardware however missing the device means it's really different) so I'm 
not quite decided about either approach but I tend to try to keep it as 
similar to real hardware as possible (so using unmodified dtb) as long as 
it does not cause real problems. But if patching the dtb makes it nicer by 
avoiding a big and maybe confusing error message on boot and it does not 
break anything else then that's OK too.
