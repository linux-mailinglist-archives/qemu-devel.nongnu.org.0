Yes.

Well.  If the image isn=E2=80=99t preallocated, all will be well because =
nothing
of the added range is entered into the metadata, so it returns zero when
read (unless there is a backing file, but that is handled independently
of has_zero_init).

But you were asking about preallocation.  As I wrote in the commit
message, the qcow2 driver lets the protocol driver preallocate the data
and then enters it as normal data clusters into its metadata.  If the
image is encrypted, it will appears as random data (or if the protocol
dirver writes non-zero data).  But then it shouldn=E2=80=99t report
has_zero_init as 1.

Let=E2=80=99s test it.

$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 src.qcow2 64M
Formatting 'src.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D67108864 cluster_size=3D65536
lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcount_bits=3D16
$ qemu-img convert -O qcow2 \
    -o \
    encrypt.format=3Dluks,encrypt.key-secret=3Dpass,preallocation=3Dmetad=
ata \
    --object secret,id=3Dpass,data=3D123456 \
    src.qcow2 dest.qcow2
$ qemu-img compare --image-opts \
    file.filename=3Dsrc.qcow2 \
    file.filename=3Ddest.qcow2,encrypt.key-secret=3Dpass \
    --object secret,id=3Dpass,data=3D123456
Content mismatch at offset 0!

Oops.


So.  We can do two things here.

(A) We drop this patch and actually make sure that preallocation always
writes zeroes, and if that cannot be done efficiently, then too bad.

Note that for qcow2, we cannot just mark all clusters as zero clusters
because that would kind of defeat the purpose of metadata preallocation.
 One of its main purposes is to prevent COW when you write to a new
image, i.e. that the qcow2 driver needs to do a read-modify-write cycle
just to zero a new cluster.  If we kept preallocating potentially random
data and hooked it up as preallocated zero clusters, those RMW cycles
would remain, thus defeating the point of metadata preallocation.  So
even for qcow2, if there is a chance that the data stored is not zero,
it needs to explicitly store zeroes then.

But the good thing here is that the protocol driver would always
guarantee that it preallocates pure zeroes.

The bad thing is that I don=E2=80=99t think we could support pure metadat=
a or
falloc preallocation together with encryption any longer, which would
definitely be an incompatible change.  Well, because we wouldn=E2=80=99t =
want to
break this support, I suppose we would in this case (encryption) resort
to linking the data clusters as preallocated zero clusters.  Which is
bad because of RMW. but well.  That=E2=80=99s life.


(B) We keep this patch and audit our use of bdrv_has_zero_init().  So
for qcow2, we need to return 0 for encrypted images.  That is suboptimal
for non-preallocated encrypted images, but again, that=E2=80=99s life.

Also, we need to return 0 if the protocol layer does not preallocate the
data to be zero -- which we can see from its setting of
bdrv_has_zero_init(), I=E2=80=99d suppose.  So for preallocated unencrypt=
ed
images, qcow2 would need to return bdrv_has_zero_init(s->data_file->bs).

But here=E2=80=99s the problem: How do we know whether an image has been
preallocated or not?  And that is a problem.  I don=E2=80=99t know a solu=
tion
off the top of my head.  We could add a parameter to
bdrv_has_zero_init() for that, but what would blockdev-mirror assume?
It doesn=E2=80=99t know.

Hm.  I suppose qcow2=E2=80=99s implementation could sift through its L2 t=
ables
and if there are any links to data clusters, it is by definition in some
way preallocated.


So I suppose B seems like the better solution if there is a way for all
format drivers to determine whether their image has been preallocated or
not?
