You're right, I don't think it matters because the client must expect
QMP events at any time.

I was trying to understand the semantics of coroutine monitor commands
from two perspectives:

1. The QMP client - do coroutine commands behave differently from
   non-coroutine commands? I think the answer is no. The monitor will
   not process more commands until the coroutine finishes?

2. The command implementation - which thread does the coroutine run in?
   I guess it runs in the main loop thread with the BQL and the
   AioContext acquired?
