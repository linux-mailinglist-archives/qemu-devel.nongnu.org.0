Some but we need to keep it as limited as possible; for example two
reasons for having separate processes both come down to security:

  a) vtpm - however screwy the qemu is, you can never get to the keys in
the vtpm

  b) virtio-gpu, loads of complex GPU code that can't break the main
qemu process.

But how does something like SELinux interact with a private dbus=20
rather than the system dbus?

Well, if the migration data was squirting down the existing vhost-user
channel then there would be no risk here; so the use of dbus is creating
the problem.

OK, as long as you somehow set it up.
