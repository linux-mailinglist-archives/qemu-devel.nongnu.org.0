My question is relative to other registers on VFs that are not
implemented in hardware, not the device address.  In addition to the
memory bit of the command register, SR-IOV VFs do not implement the
vendor and device IDs, these are to be virtualized from the values
provided in the PF SR-IOV capability.  It wouldn't make much sense to
expose a device with no PCI vendor or device ID, so I assume the z/VM
hypervisor is virtualizing these, but not the memory bit.

I don't think it would be wise to set is_virtfn without a physfn being
present in the OS view.  I believe pci_dev.is_virtfn implies
pci_dev.physfn points to the PF device.  Thanks,
