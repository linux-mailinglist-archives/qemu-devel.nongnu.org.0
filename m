Well in the theory the keyslot has the hash of the password, the salt, the =
hash function
iteration count and the active field.=20

In theory you can let the user read these values directly and write them ba=
ck=20
as is without knowing the password.
This is very ugly IMHO but will fit the classical amend definition.

I also think so. Amend interface can be *ahem* amended to be more generic :=
-)
Currently it is designed for just one use case.

This is good to know, and would mean that I was right to make blockdev-amen=
d
a block job.

This also means that when user wants to tweak some setting, he might not
want to pass all the keyslots again.

BTW, I guess that to change the master key, user ought to know all password=
s,
since each keyslot is basically an encrypted master key. I didn't read the =
LUKS v2
spec though.

We might have to since LUKS v2 becomes default in more and more distros,
so users will eventually expect it be used by us as well.
