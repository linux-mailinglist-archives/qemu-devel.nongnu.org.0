Since Jason already addresses the issue then i'll skip it.

Isn't it the great thing with open source :-)

Idea is to have a virtio-rdma device emulation (patch #2) on host that wi=
ll
relay the traffic to the real HW on host.

It will be good to have design that will allow Virtio-HW to be plugged to
the host and use the same driver. In this case the emulated device would
not be needed - the driver will "attach" to the Virtqueue exposed by the
virtio-HW instead of the emulated RDMA device.

I don't know of any public virtio-rdma HW.

vfio needs to be implemented by every HW vendor where this approach is a
generic one that is not depended on the HW.

SV-IOV has it's limitations.

And with virtio-mdev, sorry but do not know, can you elaborate more?

Well, I've posted a proposal for a talk, lets see if it'll be accepted.
