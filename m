Ok for the lack of a better option I'll switch.

With Makefiles we have two options:

1) build before everything, e.g.

linux-user/x86_64/Makefile.objs
	generated-files-y += linux-user/x86_64/syscall_nr.h

The way it works is that, by building the generated files first, we can
then rely on automated dependency tracking.  It is most useful for files
that are included widely, such as header files.


2) fine-grained dependency, e.g.
	target/arm/translate.o: target/arm/decode-neon-shared.inc.c

This needs no explanation.  It is most useful for files that are
included only once or twice, such as .inc.c files.


With Meson you have only one choice and it is a third option, namely
"build at the beginning of the corresponding target"; the way you
express it is to list the includes in the sources of that target.

The rationale is the same as (1); in terms of what is rebuilt when it is
the same as (2).  It may remove a bit of parallelism: if you edit
helper.c and insns.decode, however, helper.c won't be built until after
decode-insns.inc is created.

Yes, it is.  It is certainly a different mindset not being able to
control every aspect of the build.  On the other hand surprises are rare.

Only what's needed.

Yes, of course (we have cases of that, for example with QAPI sources).
Generated sources that are top-level (not includes) also don't hamper
parallelism of the build in any way.
