Title:
  QEMU crashes when switching consoles using SDL

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  I've trying to use QEMU with SDL, and I noticed that it doesn't behave
  well, specially when switching from VGA to any console. Resuming,
  switching is erratic when using SDL, and its effects go from creating
  a new window, doing nothing, showing a window that disappears
  inmediately or even crash.

  Tested with:
  Arch Linux with all packages updated (2016/7/26)
  TWM as window manager
  QEMU (both stable 2.6.0-1 and latest git commit f49ee63)
  Command: qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl

  sdl2 version 2.0.4-2

  How to reproduce:
  1. Open QEMU with the given command
  2. Try to switch console (Ctrl-Alt-2 for example)

  Expected behaviour:
  As in GTK, the window should now show the desired console

  Actual behaviour:
  Here I have to say I can't explain it very well. Almost always it just cr=
eates a new window that shows the desired console, but it is closed inmedia=
tley. If not, it opens a new window that keeps open, and it sometimes is re=
sponsive, but further attempts to switch consoles end causing a crash, and =
QEMU has to be SIGKILLed
