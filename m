Yeah, how do I set the reflow to 72 for specific modes?

I tend to do a lot of refactoring and "prototyping" in Pycharm, but when 
it comes to bread and butter edits I still prefer emacs. I kinda bounce 
between 'em a lot. Having emacs DTRT is still useful to me.

I appreciate the consideration. They're not just "my" words, though, 
they are "our" words!

I do give you permission to touch up things like punctuation, voice, 
etc. If I dislike the changes I can always yelp at you post-hoc when you 
post the PR email.

So I'll reiterate that I am definitely happy with such changes -- the 
precision of the technical writing here is not my strong suit as I do 
not know QAPI as intimately as you, and it's not the focus of this 
series. I don't think of it as a personal offense that someone would 
copy-edit these things.

If you're not comfortable doing it, that's OK too, but I'm definitely 
okay with things like comment and docstring edits in particular. It's 
just something that feels hard to predict.

(Anyway, I made this change. There are likely other voice and line 
length changes needed, but I think I will try to address those 
systematically when I lift missing-docstring for pylint. Probably I will 
craft a series that creates a style guide, enables sphinx, lifts 
missing-docstring, and performs this same style of cleanup, going 
module-by-module.)
