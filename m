I suggest instead using "black" and just reformat everything in a huge
patch; that's what we're using for Patchew.

It's not perfect, and especially one needs to get used to the double
quotes instead of single quotes for strings.  However overall it is
pretty good, and I've never seen it do something clearly "wrong".

If we go with "black" I suggest just doing a big patch for everything,
since it's easy for maintainers to rebase by running black at each step.
 Overall our usage of Python is small enough that it should not be a big
deal.
