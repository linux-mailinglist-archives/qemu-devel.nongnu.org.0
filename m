Basically a resend. Who's the lucky winner to pick this up for 5.1? :)

This is the follow up of
    "[PATCH RFC] memory: Don't allow to resize RAM while migrating" [1]

This series contains some (slightly modified) patches also contained in:
    "[PATCH v2 fixed 00/16] Ram blocks with resizable anonymous allocations
     under POSIX" [2]
That series will be based on this series. The last patch (#13) in this
series could be moved to the other series, but I decided to include it in
here for now (similar context).

I realized that resizing RAM blocks while the guest is being migrated
(precopy: resize while still running on the source, postcopy: resize
 while already running on the target) is buggy. In case of precopy, we
can simply cancel migration. Postcopy handling is more involved. Resizing
can currently happen during a guest reboot, triggered by ACPI rebuilds.

Along with the fixes, some cleanups.

v3 -> v4:
- Rebased and retested
- Added RBs

v2 -> v3:
- Rebased on current master
- Added RBs
- "migration/ram: Tolerate partially changed mappings in postcopy code"
-- Extended the comment for the uffdio unregister part.

v1 -> v2:
- "util: vfio-helpers: Factor out and fix processing of existing ram
   blocks"
-- Stringify error
- "migraton/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during precopy"
-- Simplified check if we're migrating on the source
- "exec: Relax range check in ram_block_discard_range()"
-- Added to make discard during resizes actually work
- "migration/ram: Discard new RAM when growing RAM blocks after
   ram_postcopy_incoming_init()"
-- Better checks if in the right postcopy mode.
-- Better patch subject/description/comments
- "migration/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during postcopy"
-- Better comments
-- Adapt to changed postcopy checks
- "migrate/ram: Get rid of "place_source" in ram_load_postcopy()"
-- Dropped, as broken
- "migration/ram: Tolerate partially changed mappings in postcopy code"
-- Better comment / description. Clarify that no implicit wakeup will
   happen
-- Warn on EINVAL (older kernels)
-- Wake up any waiter explicitly

David Hildenbrand (13):
  util: vfio-helpers: Factor out and fix processing of existing ram
    blocks
