 work).

Yes, that's what I have in mind.

We expect graph changes to happen during the polling, but I think the
caller is responsible for making sure that the top-level @bs stays
around, so we don't need to be extra careful here.

Also, bdrv_drain_invoke() is always called in the same AioContext as the
top-level drain operation, so the whole aio_context_acquire/release
stuff from this series should become unnecessary, and we don't need
atomics to access the counter either.

So I think this should really simplify the series a lot.
