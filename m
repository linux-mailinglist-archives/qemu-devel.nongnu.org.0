During User application initialization, there is one more state change:

0) 0/0/0 ---- stop to running -----> 0/0/1

>> 1) 0/0/1 ---(trigger driver to start gathering state info)---> 0/1/1

not just gathering state info, but also copy device state to be 
transferred during pre-copy phase.

Below 2 state are not just to tell driver to stop, those 2 differ.
2) is device state changed from running to stop, this is when VM 
shutdowns cleanly, no need to save device state

>> 2) 0/0/1 ---(tell driver to stop)---> 0/0/0 

>> 3) 0/1/1 ---(tell driver to stop)---> 0/1/0

above is transition from pre-copy phase to stop-and-copy phase, where 
device data should be made available to user to transfer to destination 
or to save it to file in case of save VM or suspend.

above can occur on migration cancelled or failed.

that's right, this happens in case of save VM or suspend VM.

why would reset occur on 1/0/0 -> 0/0/1 failure?

1/0/0 -> 0/0/1 fails, then user should convey that to source that 
migration has failed, then resume at source.

Sorry, I replied yes in my previous reply, but no. Default device state 
is _STOPPED. During resume _STOPPED -> _RESUMING

I think, its not required.

its 0/0/0 -> 1/0/0 while resuming.
