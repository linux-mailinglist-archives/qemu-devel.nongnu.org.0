Sorry in advance if I missed any feedback from you. That can happen,
I do make mistakes like anybody of us.

Yes, that conflict is easy.

I did this.

Could we talk about this on IRC tomorrow? I don't fully understand you here,
and I sort of understood this stuff back when I learned it, but
that was long ago, and since we are talking about permissions here,
plus an necessary hack that luks now have to make, I would like
to understand exactly what I am doing.

Other than that, I rebased the series, and all iotests (with the permission
fix below) are passing.
I'll send the rebased version once we finish the permission thing.


Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky


PS: This code which is roughtly based on your suggestions,
does pass my test write sharing test, but I don't have much confidence that it is correct:

For example, I don't think that resize permission is needed to be touched,
since resize of the 'luks' image shoudn't have any affect on encryption keys
(since luks image is basically the underlying file minus the header, decrypted,
and we don't really change the encryption key, but a encrypted keyslot which contains it).


    BlockCrypto *crypto = bs->opaque;

    bdrv_default_perms(bs, c, role, reopen_queue, perm, shared, nperm, nshared);
    /*
     * Ask for consistent read permission so that if
     * someone else tries to open this image with this permission
     * neither will be able to edit encryption keys, since
     * we will unshare that permission while trying to
     * update the encryption keys
     */
    if (!(bs->open_flags & BDRV_O_NO_IO)) {

        *nperm |= BLK_PERM_CONSISTENT_READ;

        *nshared |= (BLK_PERM_WRITE | BLK_PERM_RESIZE);
        *nperm &= ~(BLK_PERM_WRITE | BLK_PERM_RESIZE);
        *nperm |= perm & (BLK_PERM_WRITE | BLK_PERM_RESIZE);
    }
    /*
     * This driver doesn't modify LUKS metadata except
     * when updating the encryption slots.
     * Thus unlike a proper format driver we don't ask for
     * shared write/read permission. However we need it
     * when we are updating the keys, to ensure that only we

     *
     * Encryption update will set the crypto->updating_keys

    if (crypto->updating_keys) {
        /* need exclusive write access for header update */
        *nperm |= BLK_PERM_WRITE;
        /* unshare read and write permission */
        *nshared &= ~(BLK_PERM_CONSISTENT_READ | BLK_PERM_WRITE);
    }
