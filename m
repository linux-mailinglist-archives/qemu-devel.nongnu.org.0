What you said is fine, Daniel, I understand the idea, and it should be
that way. But I didn't ask for some lengthy negotiation, or waiting
for someone for months, but I just wanted to check within company if
all relevant people (that do not read QEMU devel list very often)
agree - since we, naturally, do various in-house setups with QEMU for
MIPS, that's all. This could count as the discussion on the patch, not
as a part of that loooooong "deprecated" state...

All is well,
Aleksandar
