I see that this could be useful for testing, but I think we can defer
that to a later patch. Would you be okay with that for now?

It is not the hardware that decides this and I believe that there
definitely are applications that chooses to associate multiple SQs with
a single CQ. The CQ is an attribute of the SQ and the IV of the CQ is
also specified in the create command. I believe this is already
supported.

Yes, this is definitely not very well tested.

If you insist on all of the above being implemented, then I will do it,
but I would rather defer this to later patches as this series is already
pretty large ;)
