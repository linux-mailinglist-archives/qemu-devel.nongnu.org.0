in acpi spec, they use bytes mostly (with occasional bits deviation)

that's what I don't like the most about current name, it's way too long.

I prefer having length argument, so when I'm reviewing code, I'm basically
comparing it with value in the table.
The same applies to function name, having a bunch of different
names would be distracting, at least where it comes to composing
tables.
So I prefer keeping current list of arguments.
