I think Mark's point is that modelling a device and wiring up a device
model are separate things, and the latter belongs to the board.

pci_cmd646_ide_init() is a helper for boards.  Similar helpers exist
elsewhere.

In the oldest stratum of qdev code, such helpers were static inline
functions in the device model's .h.  That way, they're kind of separate
from the device model proper, in the .c, and kind of in the board code
where they belong, via inlining.  I've always considered that a terrible
idea; it's "kind of" as in "not really".  Over time, practice moved
first to putting the helpers into .c, then to open-coding the wiring
where it belongs: in the boards.

A few helper functions have survived, e.g. in hw/lm32/milkymist-hw.h,
and the IDE helpers we're discussing here.

Of course, when the code to wire up certain devices gets overly
repetitive, factoring out common code into helpers can make sense.  But
where to put them?  I can't see an obvious home for common board
helpers.  We tend to put these wiring helpers into a device model's .c
code for want of a better place.  Tolerable, I think.
