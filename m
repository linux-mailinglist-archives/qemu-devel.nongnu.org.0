Good idea, thanks for the tip.

True. It could had helped me to check the missing packages on Travis to 
build the kernel. I'm ashamed to tell how I did it. :)

On the proposed implementation the kernel is built only once and only 
for this test case. If I move the code to setUp() it will attempt to 
build the vmlinux for every case even when not needed (suppose I add a 
'boot not CONFIG_PVH vmlinux to check it properly handle error' case 
which uses distro's kernel). Unless I put a guard like 'do not build if 
already present' which IMHO is weird. In other words, IMHO setUp() 
should hold only code that is share-able across cases.

IMHO we should merge tests which are "good enough" then interactively 
improve them. At least they will run with some frequency and eventually 
catch regressions while infra bits are improved. Now, what's 'good 
enough' for an acceptance test? Perhaps a test that run consistently?
