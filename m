Hi,

This series builds on the previous RFC.  The workaround is now applied
unconditionally of AIO mode and filesystem because we don=E2=80=99t know th=
ose
things for remote filesystems.  Furthermore, bdrv_co_get_self_request()
has been moved to block/io.c.

Applying the workaround unconditionally is fine from a performance
standpoint, because it should actually be dead code, thanks to patch 1
(the elephant in the room).  As far as I know, there is no other block
driver but qcow2 in handle_alloc_space() that would submit zero writes
as part of normal I/O so it can occur concurrently to other write
requests.  It still makes sense to take the workaround for file-posix
because we can=E2=80=99t really prevent that any other block driver will su=
bmit
zero writes as part of normal I/O in the future.

Anyway, let=E2=80=99s get to the elephant.

From input by XFS developers
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1765547#c7) it seems clear
that c8bb23cbdbe causes fundamental performance problems on XFS with
aio=3Dnative that cannot be fixed.  In other cases, c8bb23cbdbe improves
performance or we wouldn=E2=80=99t have it.

In general, avoiding performance regressions is more important than
improving performance, unless the regressions are just a minor corner
case or insignificant when compared to the improvement.  The XFS
regression is no minor corner case, and it isn=E2=80=99t insignificant.  La=
urent
Vivier has found performance to decrease by as much as 88 % (on ppc64le,
fio in a guest with 4k blocks, iodepth=3D8: 1662 kB/s from 13.9 MB/s).

Thus, I believe we should revert the commit for now (and most
importantly for 4.1.1).  We can think about reintroducing it for 5.0,
but that would require more extensive benchmarks on a variety of
systems, and we must see how subclusters change the picture.


I would have liked to do benchmarks myself before making this decision,
but as far as I=E2=80=99m informed, patches for 4.1.1 are to be collected o=
n
Monday, so we need to be quick.
