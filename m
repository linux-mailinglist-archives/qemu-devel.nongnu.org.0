A silly question, what's the reason for doing this, is this a must for=20

What's the benefit of introducing a region? It looks to me we don't=20
expect the region to be accessed directly from guest. Could we simply=20
extend device fd ioctl for doing such things?

Can we split out the common parts from vfio-pci?

The mediate ops looks quite similar to what vfio-mdev did. And it looks=20
to me we need to consider live migration for mdev as well. In that case,=20
do we still expect mediate ops through VFIO directly?

We can teach management layer to do this.
