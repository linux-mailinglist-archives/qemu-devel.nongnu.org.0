If something goes wrong on the sender side, the mgmt app should be
tearing down the destination QEMU entirely, so I'm not sure we need
to do anything special to deal with received threads.

Using semtimedwait just feels risky because it will introduce false
failures if the system/network is under high load such that the
connections don't all establish within 1 second.
