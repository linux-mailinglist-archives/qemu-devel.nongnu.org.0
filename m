** Description changed:

  Performing io intensive tasks on virtualized Windows causes the system
  to visually stutter. I can often reproduce the problem by running fio on
  windows:
  =

  fio --randrepeat=3D1 --ioengine=3Dwindowsaio --direct=3D1 --gtod_reduce=
=3D1
  --name=3Dtest --filename=3D\\.\PhysicalDrive0 --bs=3D4k --iodepth=3D128
  --size=3D4G --readwrite=3Drandread
  =

  While the fio command is running, moving the mouse pointer will be be
  laggy. The stuttering does not appear with iodepth <=3D 32 . The
  stuttering also manifests while playing games, the music and video
  pauses for a fraction of second in a playable but disturbing way.
  =

  Here are my system specs:
  =

  Host OS: archlinux
  Guest OS: Windows 10 Enterprise
  qemu version: qemu-git 8:v4.1.0.r1378.g98b2e3c9ab-1 (from AUR, compiled w=
ith -march=3Dnative)
  CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1900X 8-Core Processor
  Huge Pages: vm.nr_hugepages=3D4128
  Disk: nvme type=3Draw, io=3Dthreads bus=3Dvirtio
  GPU (passthrough): Radeon RX 570
  =

  Here are some fio test results on my windows guest:
  =

  [size=3D512M,iodepth=3D1 -> min=3D30k,avg=3D31k,stddev=3D508]
  [size=3D2G,iodepth=3D8 -> min=3D203k,avg=3D207k,stddev=3D2.3k]
  [size=3D2G,iodepth=3D16 -> min=3D320k,avg=3D330k,stddev=3D4.3k]
  [size=3D4G,iodepth=3D32 -> min=3D300k,avg=3D310k,stddev=3D4.8k]
  [size=3D4G,iodepth=3D64 -> min=3D278k,avg=3D366k,stddev=3D68.6k] -> STUTT=
ER
  [size=3D4G,iodepth=3D64 -> min=3D358k,avg=3D428k,stddev=3D52.6k] -> STUTT=
ER
  [size=3D4G,iodepth=3D128 -> min=3D92k,avg=3D217k,stddev=3D185k] -> STUTTER
  [size=3D4G,iodepth=3D128 -> min=3D241k,avg=3D257k,stddev=3D14k] -> same c=
onfig as above, but no stuttering
  =

  The min and avg values are the bandwidth values reported in KB/s by fio.
  You can see that, when the stuttering occurs, the stardard deviation is
  high and the minimum bandwidth is way below the average.
  =

  Additional note: the bandwidth reported with `fio` on my linux host is
  about 2x the one reported in the guest:
  =

  sudo fio --randrepeat=3D1 --ioengine=3Dlibaio --direct=3D1 --gtod_reduce=
=3D1
  --name=3Dtest --filename=3D/dev/nvme0n1 --bs=3D4k --iodepth=3D64 --size=
=3D512M
  --readwrite=3Drandread
  =

  read: IOPS=3D279k, BW=3D1092MiB/s (1145MB/s)(512MiB/469msec)
+ =

+ Moreover, during the fio tests on the guest I've noticed that the CPU
+ usage on the host is very high (around 450%) whereas on the guest is
+ only 10%
