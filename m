Point taken, I dislike the visitor API too.

On the former, "adding a new property" means adding an entry to a
const array.  On the latter, it means adding a new function call.

On the former, a conditional property would require defining a
new array.  A non-constant property name or type would require
making the array non-const and modifying it at runtime.

On the latter, adding a if statement on the front of that
function call or a non-constant expression as argument to the
function is trivial.

I don't know yet what's the best solution for the x86 feature
case.  Maybe duplicating the list of feature names would be a
small price to pay to get a static list of properties defined at
compilation time?  Maybe we can replace
FeatureWordInfo.feat_names[] with property introspection code
that will find the property name for a given struct field?

In either case, we need something that works for x86 and other
complex cases, or it won't be used.  Point taken.

Because we can be absolutely sure the macros (and the property
array) will be constant expressions evaluated at compilation
time.

                             * * *

Anyway, If we are the only ones discussing this, I will just
defer to your suggestions as QOM maintainer.  I hope we hear from
others.
