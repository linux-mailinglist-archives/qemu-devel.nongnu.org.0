It would.  Thanks for the suggestion, I obviously didn=E2=80=99t think of i=
t.
(Or there=E2=80=99d be a comment on how this is not the best way in theory,=
 but
in practice it=E2=80=99s good enough.)  I suppose I=E2=80=99ll see how what=

Ah, right, I didn=E2=80=99t think of that.

Yes.  I just think it actually would be 100 % in practice, so I wondered
whether it would need to be documented.

You=E2=80=99re right, though, it isn=E2=80=99t 100 %, so it should definite=
ly be
documented.  Maybe something like

In theory, we would have to keep the permissions tightened until the
node is replaced.  In practice, that would require post-replacement
cleanup infrastructure, which we do not have, and which would be
unreasonably complex to implement.  Therefore, all we can do is require
anyone who wants to replace one node by some potentially unrelated other
node (i.e., the mirror job on completion) to invoke
bdrv_recurse_can_replace() immediately before and thus minimize the time
during which some condition may arise that might forbid the swap.
