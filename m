cirrus stopped using pointers years ago, exactly for the reasons
outlined above.  Conversion was pretty straight forward.

commit 026aeffcb4752054830ba203020ed6eb05bcaba8
Author: Gerd Hoffmann <kraxel@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 15 11:47:52 2017 +0100

    cirrus: stop passing around dst pointers in the blitter
   =20
    Instead pass around the address (aka offset into vga memory).  Calculat=
e
    the pointer in the rop_* functions, after applying the mask to the
    address, to make sure the address stays within the valid range.

Drawback of this approach is that it can't be used in case you offload
all your raster ops to pixman, so the basic idea doesn't help much for
ati.  Didn't check sm501.

take care,
  Gerd
