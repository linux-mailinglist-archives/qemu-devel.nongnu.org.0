Hi,

This is regarding the new VMDK format of SESparse snapshots which is
available since ESXi 6.5 (for disks > 2TB) and is default since ESXi
6.7 (for all disks).
Unlike the previous format (VMFSSparse), SESparse's format is not
disclosed by VMware.

Even though, I believe that the format itself is not too complicated
and I'll try to give out pointers on how it is possible to implement a
read-write support for it.

In commit 98eb9733f (vmdk: Add read-only support for seSparse
snapshots) I have added a read-only support. As stated in the commit
message - I did not implement the following features which are
implemented in VMware:
    * read-write
    * journal replay
    * space reclamation
    * unmap support

I don't fully understand what you're trying to implement when you say
"read-write" since there are some scenarios for which you will not
need to implement a fully compatible SESparse image.

----

After creating an SESparse snapshot (by invoking "Take Snapshot" in
VMware), the following file:

    /var/log/hostd.log

Contains messages of the like:

[...] Const Header:
[...]  constMagic     = 0xcafebabe
[...]  version        = 2.1
[...]  capacity       = 204800
[...]  grainSize      = 8
[...]  grainTableSize = 64
[...]  flags          = 0
[...] Extents:
[...]  Header         : <1 : 1>
[...]  JournalHdr     : <2 : 2>
[...]  Journal        : <2048 : 2048>
[...]  GrainDirectory : <4096 : 2048>
[...]  GrainTables    : <6144 : 2048>
[...]  FreeBitmap     : <8192 : 2048>
[...]  BackMap        : <10240 : 2048>
[...]  Grain          : <12288 : 204800>
[...] Volatile Header:
[...] volatileMagic     = 0xcafecafe
[...] FreeGTNumber      = 0
[...] nextTxnSeqNumber  = 0
[...] replayJournal     = 0

The sizes that are seen in the log file are in sectors.
Extents are of the following format: <offset : size>

Just from the strings in this message and by information publicly
disclosed by VMware it is obvious how SESparse is implemented:

The problem with VMFSSparse (previous format) is that given an offset
to a grain in the file - you don't know if that grain is allocated or
not - you must scan all grain tables to perform space reclamation, and
even if somehow you know that the grain is not allocated - you don't
have the offset to the grain table that references it - to unmap it
from there.
This was obviously solved using the structures "FreeBitmap" and "BackMap".

FreeBitmap is simply a very big bitmap that tells you if the grain at
the offset of the bit is allocated.
Meaning:
If bit X is set to 1 then Grain[X] is allocated (Notice that each
grain is of the size "grainSize" sectors - usually 4K bytes).

Now, we can simply iterate through FreeBitmap to find grains we can reclaim.

Problem - we don't know where is the grain table to update, scanning
all grain tables is slow.

Solution: BackMap:

For Grain[X] look at BackMap[X] - BackMap[X] contains an index to
GrainTables at which the grain table resides (Multiply by the size of
a grain table in order to get the real offset).
(Notice that BackMap scales with the size of the VMDK - but only 8
bytes per entry instead 4K bytes)

Problem - when we now write to BackMap & FreeBitmap structures too -
we might experience data corruption of the SESparse format.

Solution: Journal

Write data (write what where) to the journal, mark journal dirty,
execute instructions in journal, clean dirty mark - if you crash in
the middle - you will reexecute the instructions when opening the VMDK
file.
(Notice this was not a problem in VMFSSprase since we could first
write the data in the grain, then update the grain table to the grain,
then update the grain directory to the grain table - so the data is
actually written on the last operation and the format structure is not
corrupted)

In any case, now we need to implement the following:

When opening the file:
* Execute journal (not implemented)

When reading
* Follow Grain Directory -> Grain Table -> Grain (This is implemented now)

For writing (not implemented, probably something like this)
* Follow Grain Directory
  * If grain table allocated -> get it
  * Otherwise, allocate new grain table (this probably uses
FreeGTNumber in the volatile header to know where to do so)
    * Extend the file by the size needed to store all the grains in
the grain table (I think this is 16MB by default)
  * Follow Grain Table
    * If grain allocated, get it
    * Otherwise, allocate it
* Write to grain (you may need to read it if you write only to some of
it, since now grains are 4K - it is possible to read/write half a
grain)
* Update BackMap and FreeBitmap accordingly.
* All of the above writes should go through the Journal for consistency.

When unmapping:
* Update bits in FreeBitmap (1 -> 0)

When reclaiming space:
Go through FreeBitmaps, decide if should perform cleaning (must have a
complete empty grain table), if so, reclaim
(You can only clean when a full Grain table is unmapped, copy another
grain table in its stead, you'll have to update Grains, and the Grain
directories, all operations should go through journal)

----

I'm not sure about how the journal is implemented or how does its
structures look like (write what where) but from what I understand the
size of the journal is constant (2048 sectors) it doesn't change
depending on the size of the disk, this makes sense - the size of the
journal is simply a buffer of writes and its size only affects "how
fast" you write. (2048 sectors was probably enough for VMware)

Notice that your implementation matters - you can totally conform to
the specs of SESparse but your performance may not be that good - if
you execute the journal for every sector you write - performance will
be bad. So you'll need to write to the journal until it's full or some
time has passed and then flush it.
----

In the end it really depends on what you're trying to achieve.

If you want to have a "read-write" VM working on top of an SESparse
snapshot - you can always use an overlay of a qcow2 image.
If you want to support "read-only" but to support "dirty journal" you
don't need to care much about performance and just focus on the "write
what where" format of the journal.
If you want to support a "read-write" on top of SESparse and then
expect a VM on ESXi to run with it - you only need to understand the
format of the journal if you want to support a dirty journal when
opening it or if your changes to the VMDK are not crash consistent
(You will have to implement BackMap and FreeBitmap though).

Hope this helps,
Sam
