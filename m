This is a good description of the main use case we're worried
about in x86 too, and the main reason we have added versioned CPU
models.

I remember I was planning to use `query-cpu-model-expansion` for
"please give me the best configuration for this specific CPU
model" (which would be very similar to the approach used in this
series).  Now, I need to refresh my memory and try to remember
why I concluded this approach wouldn't work for x86.

"all" is not a meaningful name to me.  It surely doesn't mean
"all features in the universe", so it means a more specific set
of features.  How is that set defined?

"valid" seems clearer, but we still need a description of what
"valid" means exactly.
