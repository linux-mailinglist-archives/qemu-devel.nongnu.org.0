Hi,

In v8, there is not too much that has changed in respect to v7.  I tried
to address all of your comments and hope I got it right.  I also hope I
got the R-bs right.


Changes from v7:
- Patch 1: Let bdrv_primary_child() assert that there’s only a single
           primary child

- Patch 2: Assert that bdrv_do_skip_filters() will not return a filter
           node

- Patch 3: Drop bdrv_unallocated_blocks_are_zero() hunk (that function
           no longer exists)

- Old patch 10: Dropped, it isn’t really important to let mirror-top
                support compressed writes, and
                bdrv_supports_compressed_writes() doesn’t really work
                with this patch

- Old patch 11: Dropped, it isn’t really important to let backup-top
                support compressed writes

- Patch 10: Rebase conflict in init_dirty_bitmap_migration()
            (The modified block is now nested one level deeper)

- Patch 11: Rebase conflict in bdrv_co_block_status()
            (bdrv_unallocated_blocks_are_zero() is no longer used)

- Patch 12:
  - Fix documentation on what the backing node after streaming is going
    to be
  - bdrv_change_backing_file() rebase conflict

- Patch 13: Try to clarify what bdrv_find_overlay() returns in its doc
            comment

- Patch 15: Optimize the overlay_bs finding loop

- Old patch 25: Rolled into the next patch (now patch 23)

- Patch 23:
  - Inline two of the three functions introduced in the old patch 25
  - The other one (bdrv_sum_allocated_file_size()) stays, but is static
    now
  (Turns out we don’t need to let block drivers use any of these
  functions for their BlockDriver.bdrv_get_allocated_File_size().)

- Old patch 27: Dropped, just let blkverify be handled like any other
                filter, because it doesn’t matter, really
                (and this allows us squashing the previous to patches)

- Patch 24: Remove _filter_actual_image_size from iotest 184

- Patch 27: Reference output change due to 184 no longer invoking
            _filter_actual_image_size

- Patch 29:
  - Let the commit message explain why base_overlay is introduced
  - Drop @replaces_node_name from qmp_drive_mirror(), because it isn’t
    needed

- Patch 31:
  - Let blk_commit_all() only commit those nodes that have a backing
    file; and ignore all filters on top of them (instead of just
    implicit filters)
  - In commit_start: %s/\<perms\>/base_perms/
  - Under commit_start.ro_cleanup: Restore the original backing file
    only if necessary, so we do not run into an abort because the
    backing chain is frozen

- Patch 33: Let img_rebase() refer to the unfiltered_bs in three more
            places

- Patch 35:
  - Documentation modifications:
    - Move a chunk of it up where it belongs (from below @backing-file
      to the general area of @block-commit)
    - Explain that you now need to issue block-job-complete whenever
      there’s a writer on @top
    - Also, @backing-file is no longer allowed whenever there’s a writer
      on @top
      - In the code, this should cause a different error message than
        when @top is in the active layer, though
  - Comment note: If @top is a root node without any writers on it, we
    still need to do an active commit, because everything else would be
    an incompatible change

- Patch 36: Trivial rebase conflict in block_int.h (necessary because
            the old patch 25 was dropped)

- Patch 37: Don’t try to fetch ImageInfo.backing-filename-format from
            the backing file open at runtime.  If the image header does
            not specify a format, just leave it empty.

- Patch 40: Use format string instead of ''.format()

- Patch 42: Add -F $IMGFMT to _make_test_img -b
