Except QAPI makes all fields potentially optional (and unordered), that's
not idiomatic.

D-Bus is machine-level oriented, it's easy to bind to various languages, it
can be pretty efficient too. It's not designed to be a good network RPC.
QMP tries to be a bit of both, but is perhaps not good enough in either.

Again, the issues we are discussing are not specific to binding QMP over
D-Bus. Binding QMP to various languages has similar problems. Perhaps those
problems are minor, perhaps we can find decent solutions, like the one you
suggest to use Rust builder pattern for commands. I think they are not
great, as I tried to explain with the versioning and runtime issues that
you have to take into account anyway at the client level. I would rather
make those problems solved at the server level, that doesn't require any
change to QMP today, just a more careful consideration when making changes
(and probably some tools to help enforce some stability).
