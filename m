I remember those benchmarks too and this is also what the paper Alex=20
referred to also confirmed. Also I've found that enabling hardfloat for=20
PPC without doing anything else is slightly slower (on a recent CPU, on=20
older CPUs could be even slower). Interetingly however it does give a=20
speedup for vector instructions (maybe because they don't clear flags=20
between each sub operation). Does that mean these vector instruction=20
helpers are also buggy regarding exceptions?

But how is that related to inexact flag and float_round_nearest_even=20
rounding mode which are the only two things can_use_fpu() function checks=
=20
for?

I probably won't try any time soon. I have several other half finished=20
stuff to hack on to not take up another one I likely can't finish, but=20
hope this discussion inspires someone to try it. I'm also interested in=20
the results. If nobody tries in the next two years maybe I get there=20
eventually.
