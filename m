Yes, there was also a "---> Port 0" before that, checking for primary=20
master and slave devices that were unit 0 and 1 but I did not include tha=
t=20
for brevity. Thus secondary master and slave devices are numbered 2 and 3=
.

To make it clear, the problem I have that prevents it from working is the=
=20
missing interrupt after switching to UDMA. The unknown slave device is=20
only causing a delay in detection but then it determines that the=20
secondary device is not working and goes further so I've only reported=20
that as a potential problem in emulation that could be investigated and=20
fixed but it's not the main problem that prevents working.

Unfortunately I don't know much about IDE so likely I would not find=20

From the logs I've seen it does seem to expect an ATA device i.e. HDD as=20
unit 3 but after trying to identify it it gets an error and finds that=20
there's no working device there and goes with just the CD drive. MorphOS=20
does the same but trying a few times before giving up, there are some log=
s=20
showing that in the above ticket,

I remember seeing log messages from guest that said it reset the ide bus=20
before trying to probe to avoid hangs that probably happen on real=20
hardware but I don't find them now. But it's possible there was a bus=20
reset before the above probing. I think it wants to get the bus to a know=
n=20
state to avoid problems due to firmware or something else leaving the bus=
=20
and devices in some weird state.

Despite being able to reproduce similar problems on ppc mips and sparc64=20
emulations with two different ide controllers (sharing bmdma code) it=20
could well be that all of these have some kind of IRQ routing problem as=20
neither of these are finished and stable yet so I'm not sure the missing=20
IRQ is coming from IDE code. Especially because in the sii3112 case it=20
seems to be generated and only get lost in the last step in the IRQ=20
conroller but don't see why. The guest should have enabled the=20
corresponding interrupt I think. For via-ide it's not obvious where the=20
IRQ gets lost, it seems to be generated later so I don't understand that=20
completely either.

See more logs in the ticket, let me know if you'd need me to check=20
something else. Thanks a lot for looking into this, I'd need to look up=20
all of these IDE interactions to try to make sense of the logs which woul=
d=20
take too much time. Maybe you can spot something easier.

Before getting to this point where it hangs waiting for the IRQ after=20
switching on UDMA the firmware did find all devices and loaded the OS fro=
m=20
the CD all right and the OS also can talk to ide devices as long as it=20
uses only PIO. The IRQ problem only happens after DMA is enabled but I'm=20
not sure it uses IRQ in PIO at all.

AmigaOS and MorphOS really want to use UDMA only (or highest DMA mode the=
=20
device reports) as otherwise it would be too slow on real hardware so I=20
don't think it wants to fall back, just failing the drive if it does not=20
work in the DMA mode it reports.

Linux may do fallback I'm not sure but booting from a=20
debian-8.11.0-powerpc-netinst.iso seems to work even after it says=20
enabling DMA, whereas I got the same problem with Linux before I hooked u=
p=20
IRQs correctly. Linux logs I get now with via-ide:

And if boots all right. I think Linux can use DMA and I see interrupts=20
with Linux so maybe the drivers work differently and only the=20
AmigaOS/MorphOS drivers do something that does not work with QEMU or=20
depend on some features on hardware that I did not model correctly.
