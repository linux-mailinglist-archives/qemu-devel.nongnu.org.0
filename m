Dear Markus,

the netmap project is alive and well, if a bit understuffed. We have=20
moved to github:

https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap

We have users from FreeBSD, where it is part of the official kernel, and=20
Linux, both from Academia and industry.

But you asked about the netmap backend in QEMU, in particular. When it=20
was merged, the decision was made to disable it by default because it=20
was not supported upstream in Linux. As Jason Wang says, this support is=20
even more unlikely now than it was then.

The fact the the backend has to be explicitly enabled and built from the=20
sources has obviously cut down the number of potential users. However,=20
we still think it is useful and we have pending updates for it. If it's=20
causing problems in the workflow, I am willing to help as much as I can.

Cheers,
Giuseppe
