All that sounds somewhat similar to the classification that we already
use in our MAINTAINERS file - Supported, Maintained, Odd-Fixes, Orphan,
Obsolete ... maybe we can avoid to introduce yet another classification
system and merge the two (e.g. by also changing the classification
system in MAINTAINERS a little bit?).
