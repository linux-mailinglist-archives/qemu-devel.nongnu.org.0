That is incorrect.

As I have said, the conceptual problem is that the iotests now run as
part of make check.  As such, allowing auto tests to run on non-Linux
platforms may introduce build failures that I cannot do anything about.

And those are very much new failures.

You have not.

The actual argument to convince me is =E2=80=9CThis does not affect any t=
ests in
the auto group, so it will not introduce build failures at this time=E2=80=
=9D.

My problem is twofold:

(1) You claim =E2=80=9CSure, there are failures, but let=E2=80=99s just d=
eal with them=E2=80=9D
and then you do not deal with them.  Seems wrong to me.

I=E2=80=99m fine with the argument =E2=80=9CSorry, royal =E2=80=98we=E2=80=
=99.  But it just doesn=E2=80=99t help
anyone to hide the errors.  If someone=E2=80=99s on BSD and wants to run =
the
iotests, let them.=E2=80=9D

That sounds good to me.

(2) Maybe someone adds a Python test in the future that is in auto and
that does not specify Linux as the only supported platform.  Then I send
a pull request and it breaks on macOS.  Now what?  Remove it from auto?
 Blindly put "macOS" in unsupported platforms?

In any case, it=E2=80=99ll be a problem for no good reason.

More on that in the next chunk.

Make you do what?  Deal with the fact that a pull request is rejected
because a test fails on macOS?

This is precisely the kind of problem I already had with adding the
iotests to make check, and I=E2=80=99m already very much not happy about =
it.
(In that case it was $DISPLAY not being set on Peter=E2=80=99s test syste=
m.)


I=E2=80=99ll let you make the deduction of =E2=80=9CThe problem isn=E2=80=
=99t allowing the
iotests to run on non-Linux platforms, but the fact that they run in
make check=E2=80=9D yourself, so that I no longer feel like I=E2=80=99m t=
he only one who
considers that having been a mistake.
