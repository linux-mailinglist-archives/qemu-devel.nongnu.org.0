The name memory is allocated in kobject_set_name() in caller,  and I 
think caller
free the memory that it allocated is reasonable, it's weird that some 
callers allocate
some memory and use function (kset_register) failed, then it free the 
memory allocated
in callers,  I think use kset_put()/kfree_const(name) in caller seems 
more reasonable.
