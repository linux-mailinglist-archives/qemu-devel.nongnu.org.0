I guessed as much.

What you've described here is indeed the reason to use CPU models. I.e.
enabling the migration from a host of one type to another by creating a
guest that only enables the features contained in both hosts (as well as
maintaining all state that describes the CPU type, e.g. MIDR).
Unfortunately, unless your KVM has patches that aren't upstream, then that
doesn't work on AArch64 KVM (more on that below). It may appear to be
working for you, because your guest kernel and userspace don't mind the
slight differences exposed to it between the hosts, or those differences
are limited to explicitly disabled features. If that's the case, then I
would guess that using '-cpu host' and disabling the same features would
"work" as well.

Here's some more details on why the Cortex-A72 CPU model doesn't matter
with upstream KVM. First, upstream AArch64 KVM doesn't support CPU models,
and it doesn't even have a Cortex-A72 preferred target. For Cortex-A72
it will use "KVM_ARM_TARGET_GENERIC_V8", which is the same thing 'host'
would do when running on a Cortex-A72. Second, if V2 of the Cortex-A72-
based CPU you're using changed the revision of the MIDR, or any other
state that gets passed directly through to the guest like the MIDR, then
that state will change on migration. If a guest looks before migration and
again after migration, then it could get confused. A guest kernel may only
look once on boot and then not notice, but anything exposed to userspace
is extra risky, as userspace may check more frequently.

In short, without KVM patches that aren't upstream, then it's risky to
migrate between machines with V1 and V2 of these CPUs. And, it doesn't
help to use the Cortex-A72 CPU model.
