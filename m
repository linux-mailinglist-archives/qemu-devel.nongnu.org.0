In the qmp_backup() case (not qmp_transaction()) there is:

  void qmp_drive_backup(DriveBackup *arg, Error **errp)
  {

      BlockJob *job;
      job =3D do_drive_backup(arg, NULL, errp);
      if (job) {
          job_start(&job->job);
      }
  }

job_start() is called without any thread synchronization, which is
usually fine because the coroutine doesn't run until job_start() calls
aio_co_enter().

Now that the before write notifier has been installed early, there is
indeed a race between job_start() and the write notifier accessing
job->co from an IOThread.

The write before notifier might see job->co !=3D NULL before job_start()
has finished.  This could lead to issues if job_*() APIs are invoked by
the write notifier and access an in-between job state.

A safer approach is to set a BackupBlockJob variable at the beginning of
backup_run() and check it from the before write notifier.

That said, I don't understand the benefit of this patch and IMO it makes
the code harder to understand because now we need to think about the
created but not started state too.
