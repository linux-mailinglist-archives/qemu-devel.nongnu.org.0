What I meant is that, without proper changes, SafeStack breaks 
co-routines. Since they are heavily used in the io subsystem, this is 
probably the best class of tests to make sure co-routines are working 
fine with SafeStack.

I initially re-enabled the iotests for my internal testing.

Since I wasn't seeing any issue, I thought it would be useful to keep 
running this to make sure future implementations of SafeStack won't 
break co-routines again.

Yes, that was the idea. SafeStack should pass the tests without extra 
output.

It did (pass) on my testing machine. However I don't remember if I did 
the full (slow) check or only the partial one.

Will check again before I submit v2
