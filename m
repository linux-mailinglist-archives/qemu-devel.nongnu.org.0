right, _prt confused me for a while.

But boiler-plate related to QOM properties set/get methods was considered
tolerable back then.
It was a long time ago, so I don't recall why we decided to abandon
qdev properties API.

I also like old qdev API as it can be introspected (it's just data at
class level), very concise when used and has default values.

Instead of duplicating all that pointer arithmetic from qdev properties
in QOM API, it could be better to fix qdev properties so that they
would work for Object as well.
At least all that thrown away type safety would stay constrained/hidden
inside of qdev property macros, instead of being opencoded (offsets) all
over the place.

How hard it would be make qdev properties to work with Object and what
makes you duplicate ugly part of it in QOM instead of making them to
handle Object strait away?
That would also result in huge removal of boiler plate of current QOM
properties.

That should suit your goal to make (most) properties introspectable
and statically described.
