Per APIC spec 5.2.12, MADT contains a *main* table and several *sub* tables
(Interrupt Controllere), so the idea is give a callback hook in
AcpiDeviceIfClass for each table, including *main* and *sub* table.

Current AcpiDeviceIfClass has one callback pc_madt_cpu_entry for some *sub*
tables, after replacing the AcpiDeviceIfClass will look like this:

typedef struct AcpiDeviceIfClass {
    /* <private> */
    InterfaceClass parent_class;

    /* <public> */
    void (*ospm_status)(AcpiDeviceIf *adev, ACPIOSTInfoList ***list);
    void (*send_event)(AcpiDeviceIf *adev, AcpiEventStatusBits ev);
-   void (*madt_cpu)(AcpiDeviceIf *adev, int uid,
-                    const CPUArchIdList *apic_ids, GArray *entry);
+   madt_operation madt_main;
+   madt_operation *madt_sub;
} AcpiDeviceIfClass;

By doing so, each arch could have its own implementation for MADT.

After this refactoring, build_madt could be simplified to:

build_madt(GArray *table_data, BIOSLinker *linker, PCMachineState *pcms,
           struct madt_input *input)
{
    ...

    if (adevc->madt_main) {
        adevc->madt_main(table_data, madt);
    }

    for (i = 0; ; i++) {
        sub_id = input[i].sub_id;
        if (sub_id == ACPI_APIC_RESERVED) {
            break;
        }
        opaque = input[i].opaque;
        adevc->madt_sub[sub_id](table_data, opaque);
    }

    ...
}

input is a list of data necessary to build *sub* table. Its details is also
arch dependent.

For following new arch, what it need to do is prepare the input array and
implement necessary *main*/*sub* table callbacks.
