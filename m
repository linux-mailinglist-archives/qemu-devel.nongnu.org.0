Quick analysis of the attached file show the SDHCI starts multi-block =

DMA transfer (for 0xffea blocks), while the SD card is not initialized.

The card keeps returning zero data (because not in the SENDING state).

The problem seems related to this comment in =

sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks():

     /* XXX: Some sd/mmc drivers (for example, u-boot-slp) do not =

account for
      * possible stop at page boundary if initial address is not page =

aligned,
      * allow them to work properly */
     if ((s->sdmasysad % boundary_chk) =3D=3D 0) {
         page_aligned =3D true;
     }

Setting page_aligned to false avoid the infinite loop.

You found a case where s->blkcnt is never decremented (thus the infinite =

loop & unresponsiveness). See:

             if (((boundary_count + begin) < block_size) && page_aligned) {
                 s->data_count =3D boundary_count + begin;
                 boundary_count =3D 0;
              } else {
                 s->data_count =3D block_size;
                 boundary_count -=3D block_size - begin;
                 if (s->trnmod & SDHC_TRNS_BLK_CNT_EN) {
                     s->blkcnt--;
                 }
             }

  I am attaching the qtest commands for reproducing it.
  I can reproduce it in a qemu 5.0 build using:

  qemu-system-i386 -M pc-q35-5.0 -qtest stdio -device sdhci-pci,sd-spec-
  version=3D3 -device sd-card,drive=3Dmydrive -drive if=3Dsd,index=3D0,file

  -monitor none < attachment

  Please let me know if I can provide any further info.
