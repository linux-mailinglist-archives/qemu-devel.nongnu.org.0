I'll try to adjust but I think you should also try to split patches (like
you did eventually with the addition of patch 3).

Some test program to be run in a real guest that gets improved performance
with this patch set for example.

The only way to avoid frustration when things don't go to your pace
is to take control, as you decided to do :)

No, this friction and stagnancy is essentially the result of not sharing

Tflush requests are handled in the top-half exclusively by design, ie.
they rely on the worker thread handling the targeted request to yield
control back to the main I/O thread. Since this doesn't happen anymore
with your patches, I'm not sure how you be able to abort a _many readdir_ 
request once it's been fired into a worker thread.

A possible solution could be to break down a Treaddir into multiple
_many readdirs_ jobs, and have a knob or some logic to control the
latency ratio.

Ending up with a mix of two different kind of mutexes for 9p2000.L and .u is
a good enough reason for me.

Ah it wasn't my point. I was just saying that any valuable change for
9p2000.L prevails and if you have to change some common code (eg.
locking) that could impact the 9p2000.u experience, you can do it
anyway, even if you only do smoke testing with 9p2000.u.
