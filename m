Here's a shot (although I'm not 100% certain I've captured the nuances 
correctly):

Override the image locking system of QEMU by forcing the node to utilize 
weaker shared access for permissions where it would normally request 
exclusive access.  When there is the potential for multiple instances to 
have the same file open (whether this invocation of qemu is the first or 
the second instance), both instances must permit shared access for the 
second instance to succeed at opening the file.
