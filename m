Devices can be wired together without a bus intermediary.  You
definitely want a bus when the physical connection you model has one.
If not, a bus may be useful anyway, say because it provides a convenient
way to encapsulate the connection model, or to support -device bus=...

Management applications should move to -blockdev.  -drive has too much
bad magic sticking to it.

We're not urging humans to switch, at least not yet.  We may want to
provide convenience features on top of plain -blockdev before we do.

As far as I know, we don't yet eschew -drive in documentation or commit
messages.  Perhaps we should consider such a policy for documentation.
