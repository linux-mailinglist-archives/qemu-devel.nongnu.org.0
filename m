Correct.

Solving that problem took time, but that's sunk cost now.

I doubt we'll be there in no time, but certainly much sooner than if we
have to grapple with compatibility to a byzantine CLI nobody truly
understands.

There's one known issue caused by having "a non-JSON command line"
(actually: dotted keys as sugar for JSON): pressure to reduce nesting.

Consider chardev-add.  Example:

    {"execute": "chardev-add",
     "arguments": {"id": "bar",
                   "backend": {"type": "file",
                               "data": {"out": "/tmp/bar.log"}}}}

The arguments as dotted keys:

    id=3Dbar,backend.type=3Dfile,backend.data.out=3D/tmp/bar.log

Observe there's quite some of nesting.  While that's somewhat cumbersome
in JSON, it's a lot worse with dotted keys, because there nesting means
repeated key prefixes.  I could give much worse examples, actually.

We'd rather have something like

    id=3Dbar,type=3Dfile,out=3D/tmp/bar.log

Back to JSON:

    "arguments": {"id": "bar", "type": "file", "out": "/tmp/bar.log"}

QAPI can do this, but it uses feature that predate chardev-add.

We don't want to duplicate the chardev-add schema in modern, flattened
form for the CLI.

So the compatibility problem actually shifts to QMP: can we evolve the
existing QMP command compatibly at a reasonable cost in design, coding
and complexity to support flat arguments?
