Yes, I agree kernel could expose such sysfs interface to educate
openstack how to filter out devices. But I still think the proposed
migration_version (or rename to migration_compatibility) interface is
still required for libvirt to do double check.

In the following scenario: 
1. openstack chooses the target device by reading sysfs interface (of json
format) of the source device. And Openstack are now pretty sure the two
devices are migration compatible.
2. openstack asks libvirt to create the target VM with the target device
and start live migration.
3. libvirt now receives the request. so it now has two choices:
(1) create the target VM & target device and start live migration directly
(2) double check if the target device is compatible with the source
device before doing the remaining tasks.

Because the factors to determine whether two devices are live migration
compatible are complicated and may be dynamically changing, (e.g. driver
upgrade or configuration changes), and also because libvirt should not
totally rely on the input from openstack, I think the cost for libvirt is
relatively lower if it chooses to go (2) than (1). At least it has no
need to cancel migration and destroy the VM if it knows it earlier.

So, it means the kernel may need to expose two parallel interfaces:
(1) with json format, enumerating all possible fields and comparing
methods, so as to indicate openstack how to find a matching target device
(2) an opaque driver defined string, requiring write and test in target,
which is used by libvirt to make sure device compatibility, rather than
rely on the input accurateness from openstack or rely on kernel driver
implementing the compatibility detection immediately after migration
start.

Does it make sense?

Thanks
Yan
