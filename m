We found cases where a few of the *_cpu_exec_interrupt per arch functions
call CPU class's cc->do_interrupt function pointer (for example
arm_cpu_exec_interrupt does this).

This is an issue because *_cpu_exec_interrupt will hold the BQL across the
call to cc->do_interrupt, and *_do_interrupt will also hold the BQL.

Most of the arches do not have this issue because they call the *_do_interrupt
function for that arch directly, and in those cases we will change to call
the function *_do_interrupt_locked.

We see a few possible solutions to this:

1) We could go back to the option of conditionalizing the BQL inside
   these few *_do_interrupt functions, only acquiring the BQL if it is not
   already held.  I counted 3 different arches that directly use the
->do_interrupt
   function from their *_cpu_exec_interrupt.

2) Another perhaps cleaner option is to add a new cpu class function
->do_interrupt_locked.
   This lets callers like *_cpu_exec_interrupt call to ->do_interrupt_locked
   with lock held and solves the issue without resorting to conditional locking.

   Another benefit we could gain from this approach is to simplify our solution
   overall by adding a common do_interrupt function.

   void cpu_common_do_interrupt(CPUState *cs)
   {
        CPUClass *cc = CPU_GET_CLASS(cpu);
        qemu_mutex_lock_iothread();
        cc->do_interrupt_locked(cpu);
        qemu_mutex_unlock_iothread();
    }
   cc->do_interrupt would be set to cpu_common_do_interrupt by default
in cpu_class_init.
   In other words, the base cpu class would handle holding the BQL for us,
   and we would not need to implement a new *_do_interrupt function
for each arch.

We are thinking that 2) would be a good option.

What are the opinions on these possible solutions?  Or are there other
solutions that we should consider here?

Thanks & Regards,
-Rob
