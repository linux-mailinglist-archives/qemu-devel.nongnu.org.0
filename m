*If* QEMU "fixed up" the user's configuration, then QEMU should indeed
warn the user.

But it doesn't fix up anything here.  This broken code is unused.

It's indeed easier to remove broken unused code than to try fixing it.
YAGNI.

There is no way to trigger the warning.  If we dropped PATCH 1 instead
of fixing it as I did in v2, then the only way to trigger the warning is
-M sam460ex -m 64 or -m 32, and the only way to avoid it is to don't do
that.

Why would a user care whether he gets DDR or DDR2 memory?

This theoretical.  Remember, we're talking about unused code.  Proof:

    $ ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc -M sam460ex -m 4096
    qemu-system-ppc: Max 1 banks of 2048 ,1024 ,512 ,256 ,128 ,64 ,32 MB DI=
MM/bank supported
    qemu-system-ppc: Possible valid RAM size: 2048

I figure commit a0258e4afa "ppc/{ppc440_bamboo, sam460ex}: drop RAM size
fixup" removed the only uses.  If you disagree with it, take it up with
Igor, please.

My commit message explains:

     The Error ** argument must be NULL, &error_abort, &error_fatal, or a
     pointer to a variable containing NULL.  Passing an argument of the
     latter kind twice without clearing it in between is wrong: if the
     first call sets an error, it no longer points to NULL for the second
     call.

     spd_data_generate() can pass @errp to error_setg() more than once when
     it adjusts both memory size and type.  Harmless, because no caller
     passes anything that needs adjusting.  Until the previous commit,
     sam460ex passed types that needed adjusting, but not sizes.

Now have a look at the code I delete:

    if (size < 4) {
        error_setg(errp, "SDRAM size is too small");
        return NULL;
    }
    sz_log2 =3D 31 - clz32(size);
    size =3D 1U << sz_log2;
    if (ram_size > size * MiB) {
--->    error_setg(errp, "SDRAM size 0x"RAM_ADDR_FMT" is not a power of 2, =
"
                   "truncating to %u MB", ram_size, size);
    }
    if (sz_log2 < min_log2) {
--->    error_setg(errp,
                   "Memory size is too small for SDRAM type, adjusting type=
");
        if (size >=3D 32) {
            type =3D DDR;
            min_log2 =3D 5;
            max_log2 =3D 12;
        } else {
            type =3D SDR;
            min_log2 =3D 2;
            max_log2 =3D 9;
        }
    }
    [...]
    if (size > (1ULL << sz_log2) * nbanks) {
--->    error_setg(errp, "Memory size is too big for SDRAM, truncating");
    }

If more than one of the conditions guarding these error_setg() is true,
and @errp is neither null, &error_abort, nor &error_fatal, then it'll
point to an Error * that is not null for the non-first error_setg()
call.  This will trip the assertion in error_setv().

I don't doubt it worked in your testing.

It's still wrong.

Is there any board that genuinely wants to decide what's an error and
what's a warning?

Here's spd_data_generate() contract again:

        If everything's fine, return non-null and don't set an error.

        Else, if memory size or type need adjusting, return non-null and
        set an error describing the adjustment.

        Else, return null and set an error reporting why no data can be
        generated.

It has a grand total of two users.  Both treat the second case as
warning, and the third as error.

Until you have a user that wants to handle things differently, you're
overcomplicating things.

YAGNI!
