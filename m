I would  expect this then to be reset only after successful ioctl call.

This is to cover the cases (hopefully rare but still) when the host kernel
won't get updated, leaving the issue exposed to the guest. Not sure what
or if there is any policy regarding that in Qemu (?) There is also no mechanism
within KVM to allow the user space to verify whether the fix is available
or not. Capabilities are not designed for that (if I got things right) unless
user-space interface is broken ... which is not entirely the case
here.

I can still play around with this for a bit to make it more .. sensible,
keeping in mind the potential risk with the current solution you have
pointed out. I would still like to keep the abort injection as that is the
main reason behind having this change. It might be a bit tricky,
(time-wise)  to add the 'def behaviour' interface though.
 Is there anything else that could potentially benefit from it ?
