That was before we had a deprecation process.  Now we do.  If we are 
still worried about it, then we should start the deprecation clock 
(squeezing it into 4.2-rc3 is risky, more likely is starting it in 5.0, 
so that we get rid of string support in 5.2).  If we are not worried 
about it, then we can just kill the misfeature in 5.0.

Yes, it's time to revive that work (I have no idea if my patches from 
back then will still rebase nicely, though).
