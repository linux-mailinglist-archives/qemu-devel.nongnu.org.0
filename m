I'm running them in a container ('unshare chroot') and aarch64 needs a 
patch that hasn't been merged:

   "[PATCH] linux-user: check valid address in access_ok()"
   https://patchew.org/QEMU/20190208173520.15007-1-remi@remlab.net/

I have a skipfile that contains:

futex_wait03
mmap13
mmap16
msgctl10
msgctl11
ptrace01
ptrace02
ptrace03
ptrace05
remap_file_pages01
remap_file_pages02
sendmsg01
fork13
fork14
creat07
mremap03

but I didn't update it for a while.

I will test as soon as possible your series in my environment.

Thanks,
Laurent
