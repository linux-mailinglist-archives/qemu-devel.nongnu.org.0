Can we just have a file "blacklist.local" (which doesn't exist by default)
where you list tests to skip locally ?

Or a "group.local" such that any info in this group.local file will replace
the default info extracted from the test file ?

A test-XXXXXXXXX.sh or a XXXXXX.test  naming convention ?

The key goal of the patch is to avoid conflicts from clashing changes
between branches. To full achieve that goal we need to both avoid
touching the shared groups file, but more than than, we must avoid
creating clashing test filenames.

If we keep using 3-digit filenames then the goal of this patch is
not achieved, as the risk of clashes is still higher. IOW, we must
switch to a more verbose naming convention to increase the entropy
and thus eliminate risk of clashes. If this is done, then the idea
of reserving previously used test names ceases to be something to
worry about.

Daniel
