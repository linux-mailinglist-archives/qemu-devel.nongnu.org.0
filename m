Yep, so QEMU's stance is to only support the latest version of a draft
specification. Once a specification moves from draft to frozen we will
also only support the frozen spec.

I understand that there is hardware with the v0.7.1 of the vector
extension. But in QEMU we don't have the resources for RISC-V to
maintain multiple sets of draft extensions. Especially the vector
extension, which is very different between v0.7.1 and v1.0 (see the 78
patches in this series).

I realise this is disappointing for companies and people who have
invested in v0.7.1 in QEMU, and I hope it doesn't put anyone off
upstream work. Having the v0.7.1 even for a short period of time has
been helpful for the vector extension development and related
software/tools.

If in the future there is broad community support for v0.7.1 and we
can get some more QEMU resources for RISC-V we can re-evaluate v0.7.1
support. But for the time being it will just be dropped.

There are a few QEMU releases with v0.7.1 support, so you can use
those for development. The v0.7.1 has received a few bug fixes in the
upstream code base which will be beneficial for those using it.

Sorry about that

Alistair
