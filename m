When you view the source of my emails you'll always see a "DKIM-Signature:" 
field in the email header, which is a signature of the email's body and the 
specific email header fields listed in the "DKIM-Signature:" block, so the 
original server can choose by itself which header fields to include ("h=...") 
for signing, but the standard requires the From: field must always be 
included.

A receiving server then obtains the public key from the domain's DNS records 
and checks if the DKIM signature of the email was correct:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail

Additionally the receiving server obtains the so called "DMARC" entry from the 
domain's DNS records. The "DMARC" DNS entry contains the domain's general 
policies how receiving email servers shall handle verification of emails of 
this domain. For instance the DMARC entry may list SMTP servers (e.g. IPs, DNS 
names) eligble to send emails on behalf of the domain at all, and it defines 
what receiving email servers shall do with emails which were identified of not 
being from an eligible source (e.g. sender IP not listed in DMARC entry or 
missing or wrong DKIM signature in email header). For instance if the policy 
is "quarantine" in the DMARC entry then receiving servers are advised to 
simply drop invalid emails:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC

Well, mailman is handling this correctly. It replaces the "From:" field with a 
placeholder and instead adds my actual email address as "Reply-To:" field. 
That's the common way to handle this on mailing lists, as also mentioned here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC#From:_rewriting

So IMO patchew should automatically use the value of "Reply-To:" in that case 
as author of patches instead.

Reducing security cannot be the solution.

I use "git format-patch ..." to dump the invidiual emails as raw email sources 
and then I'll send those raw emails from the command line. So I have even more 
control of what is exactly sent out and could of course also add custom email 
header fields if required, if that would solve the situation somehow, i.e. 
manually as first test and later in automated way. That's not the issue here.

The problem however is that there is probably not any header field I could add 
that would solve the problem. Because I guess patchew is really just taking 
the first "From:" field as author, period.

I think the source files are available, so I could check that.

Well, okay :)
