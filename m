GETADDRINFO(3)

  If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then IPv4
  addresses are returned in the list pointed to by res only if
  the local system has at least one IPv4 address configured, and
  IPv6 addresses are returned only if the local system has at
  least one IPv6 address configured.  The loopback address is not
  considered for this case as valid as a configured address.
  This flag is useful on, for example, IPv4-only systems, to
  ensure  that  getaddrinfo() does not return IPv6 socket addresses
  that would always fail in connect(2) or bind(2).

I'm a little confused, and I don't feel fluent enough with English to be
sure that "only if A and only if B" is equivalent to "requires (A or
B)". Maybe the man page should use 'or' instead of 'and' here...

Title:
  test-char fails if host has no network interfaces

  This seems to be related to use of AI_ADDRCONFIG in qemu-sockets.c inet_p=
arse_connect_saddr, dropping it fixes the test. 'man getaddrinfo' makes it =
sound like AI_ADDRCONFIG requires the host to have a non-loopback ipv4 or i=

  This host setup may seem niche, but it is what the 'mock' RPM build
  tool has by default. In Fedora we run the test suite during the RPM
  build, so the failing test causes a bit of pain for certain workflows
