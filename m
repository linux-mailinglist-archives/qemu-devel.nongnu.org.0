Public bug reported:

Hi,

Finding this one a bit odd, but I am loading a driver (kext) in a macOS
guest ... and it works, on the first VM (domain) startup after a full /
clean host OS boot (or reboot). However, if I even reboot the guest OS,
then the driver load fails =3D> can be "corrected" by a full host OS
reboot (which seems very extreme).

Is this a known issue, and/or is there a workaround?

FYI, running,
QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)
Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

This is for a macOS guest, on a Linux host.

Thanks!
