Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I am trying to access the CDROM (iso) from QEMU using FreeDOS and I
  get an error when doing a directory for:

  i can boot from the iso but if i exit to access the files from the
  CDROM ISO i get the attached error.

  I believe there is an issue with the QEMU for the Raspberry Pi.

  I am using a Raspberry Pi3 with the latest full Raspbian Buster load
