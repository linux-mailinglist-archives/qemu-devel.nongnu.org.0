We already do have commands to write to an iport, and to inject MCEs for
example; is this that much different?

You could add a one time log entry to say that this mischeivous command
had been used.

I think where it might be practically useful is if you were debugging a
hung customers VM and need to find a way to get it to move again.
THat's something I'm not familiar with on the virtio side;
