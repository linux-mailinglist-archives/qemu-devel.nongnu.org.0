You asked why the class has the init it has, and I answered :)

If you have a non-trivial error message format convention, you have a
use for a function formatting error messages.

If you have a separation between diagnose and report of errors, you you
have a use for a transport from diagnose to report.  In Python, that's
raise.

The existing error message in main() has neither.

The existing error class QAPIError caters for the existing users.

For testing and debugging, treating "prefix is sane" as a precondition
is fine.  I wouldn't even bother checking it.  A check would catch
accidents, and these accidents seem vanishingly unlikely to me.

Evidence: we did without *any* prefix checking for *years*.  I added it
in commit 1cf47a15f18 just for completeness.

If you genuinely think a check is needed there, that's the way to go.
