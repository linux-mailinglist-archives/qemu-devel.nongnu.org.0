Hi Andrew,

 It also assumes the memory layout is the same?

Yes.

y allocated memory so addresses are not fixed. While the UEFI firmware does=
 try to keep S3 and S4 layouts consistent between boots, I'm not aware of a=
ny mechanism to keep the memory map address the same between versions of th=
e firmware?

It's not about RAM, but platform MMIO.

The core of the issue here is that the -D FD_SIZE_4MB and -D FD_SIZE_2MB
build options (or more directly, the different FD_SIZE_IN_KB macro
settings) set a bunch of flash-related build-time constant macros, and
PCDs, differently, in the following files:

- OvmfPkg/OvmfPkg.fdf.inc
- OvmfPkg/VarStore.fdf.inc
- OvmfPkg/OvmfPkg*.dsc

As a result, the OVMF_CODE.fd firmware binary will have different
hard-coded references to the variable store pflash addresses.
(Guest-physical MMIO addresses that point into the pflash range.)

If someone tries to combine an OVMF_CODE.fd firmware binary from e.g.
the 4MB build, with a variable store file that was originally
instantiated from an OVMF_VARS.fd varstore template from the 2MB build,
then the firmware binary's physical address references and various size
references will not match the contents / layout of the varstore pflash
chip, which maps an incompatibly structured varstore file.

For example, "OvmfPkg/VarStore.fdf.inc" describes two incompatible
EFI_FIRMWARE_VOLUME_HEADER structures (which "build" generates for the
OVMF_VARS.fd template) between the 4MB (total size) build, and the
1MB/2MB (total size) build.

The commit message below summarizes the internal layout differences,
from 1MB/2MB -> 4MB:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/b24fca05751f

Excerpt (relevant for OVMF_VARS.fd):

  Description                Compression type                Size [KB]
