You're right, except for the link name: it's parent_bus.

So the qtree is actually embedded in the QOM graph: it's the device and
bus nodes connected by the child edges from device to provided bus and
parent_bus link egdes from device to bus it's plugged into, except the
latter are backward rather than forward.

Strange: even bus-less devices have this parent_bus link, and its value
is "" (the underlying pointer is null, and null gets mapped to "", for
better or worse).

Should the property be limited to devices that actually have a parent
bus?

Plausible.  I guess the separate qtree was kept even though it's
redundant with the QOM graph because switching its users to the QOM
graph would be work.
