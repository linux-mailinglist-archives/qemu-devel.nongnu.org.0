> +Clocks states can be migrated by adding an entry into the device

> +such an entry and should be used. This is typically used to migrate an input
> +clock state. The following example describes it::

> +    MyDeviceState {
> +        DeviceState parent_obj;
> +        [...] /* some fields */
> +        Clock *clk;

> +        .name = "my_device",
> +        .fields = (VMStateField[]) {
> +            [...], /* other migrated fields */
> +            VMSTATE_CLOCK(clk, MyDeviceState),
> +            VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST()
> +        }
> +    };
> +
> +The second solution is to restore the clock state using information already

during the ``post_load()`` migration callback.
