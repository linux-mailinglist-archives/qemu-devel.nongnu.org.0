Hmm, true, we would have to keep track of draining at the BlockBackend
level and consider it in blk_remove_bs() and blk_insert_bs(). Maybe
that's not worth it.

If we use bdrv_drained_begin/end directly, I think we need to drain both
the old and the new root node during the process.

How do we know that the VM is stopped? And why would we require this?
Your patch doesn't implement or at least check this, and it seems a bit
impractical for example when all you want is inserting a filter node.
