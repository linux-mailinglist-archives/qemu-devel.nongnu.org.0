What is the issue with root in user namespaces?

I remember a few years ago it was seen as a major security issue but
don't remember if container runtimes were already using user namespaces
back then.

I guess the goal might be simply to minimize Linux capabilities as much
as possible?

virtiofsd could nominally run with an arbitrary uid/gid but it still
needs the Linux capabilities that allow it to change uid/gid and
override file system permission checks just like the root user. Not sure
if there is any advantage to running with uid 1000 when you still have
these Linux capabilities.
