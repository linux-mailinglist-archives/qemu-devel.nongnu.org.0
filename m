Be _very_ careful here! In systems without EL3 (and without NV), SMC
UNDEFs rather than trapping to EL2. Given that, we shouldn't build a
hypervisor ABI that depends on SMC.

I am strongly of the opinion that (for !NV) we should always use HVC
here and have KVM appropriately forward calls to userspace, rather than
trying to use HVC/SMC to distinguish handled-by-kernel and
handled-by-userspace events.

For NV, the first guest hypervisor would use SMC to talk to KVM, all
else being the same.

I think this would be the best approach, since it puts userspace in
charge of everything.

However, this interacts poorly with FW-based mitigations that we
implement in hyp. I suspect we'd probably need a mechanism to delegate
that responsibility back to the kernel, and figure out if that has any
interaction with thigns that got punted to userspace...

Thanks,
Mark.
