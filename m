I meant that they match most of the time but when they don't we hit the
issue we are discussing right now.

Yes.

The interrupt sets IR DR according to the AIL value, so it may be
handled in virtual mode as well.

The purpose of the mmu_on flag is to know what the AIL value will be at
the time the interrupt happens and therefore know in which mode the
interrupt will be handled, i.e where to put the breakpoint. Remember:

MMU off or AIL = 0 => 0xd00
AIL = 3 => 0xc000000000004d00

With this recent change, I also use it to know what I should temporarily
put in MSR_DR|IR so that the address translation doesn't
fail. Ultimately, the mmu_on flag only influences the placement of the
breakpoint at the Trace Interrupt handler.
