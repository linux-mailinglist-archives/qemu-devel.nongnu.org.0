I was intended to convince Marc that it's fine to lose data if the
serial connection is broken with an example. Now, I'm taking the
example trying to convince both of you: Lets assume we have a ARM
board and the UART (RS232) cable is unplugged and plugged in the middle of
system booting. I think we would get some output lost. We're emulating
pl011 and I think it would have same behavior. However, I'm not sure
if it makes sense :)

Peter, I don't think qemu_chr_fe_add_watch() can help on the issue of
blocking system from booting. I had the code to use qemu_chr_fe_add_watch()
in pl011 driver as the attachment shows. The attached patch will be posted
for review shortly as I think it's valuable to support 16-character-in-depth
TxFIFO. The linux guest can't boot successfully if I had some code to strike
the early console. The serial is built on tcp connection (127.0.0.1:50900)
and the server side don't receive the incoming messages, as before. The root
cause is guest kernel is hold until the TxFIFO has available space. On the
other hand, the QEMU can't send the characters in TxFIFO to the backend
successfully, which means the TxFIFO is always full.

For the guest kernel, linux/drivers/tty/serial/amba-pl011.c::pl011_putc() is
used to write outgoing characters to TxFIFO. The transmission can't be finished
if there is no space in TxFIFO, indicated by UART01x_FR_TXFF.

    static void pl011_putc(struct uart_port *port, int c)
    {
            while (readl(port->membase + UART01x_FR) & UART01x_FR_TXFF)
                    cpu_relax();
            if (port->iotype == UPIO_MEM32)
                    writel(c, port->membase + UART01x_DR);
            else
                    writeb(c, port->membase + UART01x_DR);
            while (readl(port->membase + UART01x_FR) & UART01x_FR_BUSY)
                    cpu_relax();
    }

If above analysis is correct and the first approach doesn't work out. We have to
consider the 2nd approach - adding option to backend to allow losing data. I'm
going to add "allow-data-lost" option for TYPE_CHARDEV_SOCKET. With the option,
a back-off algorithm in tcp_chr_write(): The channel is consider as broken if
it fails to transmit data in last continuous 5 times. The transmission is still
issued when the channel is in broken state and recovered to normal state if
transmission succeeds for once.

Thanks,
Gavin
