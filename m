The command is run here if I'm not mistaken Does this set the irq right 
away on QEMU where on real hadware this may take some time? Not sure if 
that's a problem but trying to understand what's happening.

So these ide_ioport_read calls clear the irq bit...

...that would be checked here?

What I don't get is why ide_ioport_read is called at all and from where if 
that's meant to emulate legacy ide ISA ioport reads and we have a PCI 
device accessed via PCI regs? Should the device behave differently in 
legacy and native mode with respect of clearing irq bit on register reads?

There's a possibility that software may want to clear bits without reading 
the current value so having a way to do that can be explained.

But the doc not mentioning irq bits should be cleared on read and drivers 
do it by writing after reading is sufficient evidence that CMD646 likely 
does not clear bits on read.

The difference here is that status bits still there after ide_ioport_read 
when it gets it via pci_cfg_read than writes to that reg to clear it.

I'm afraid I don't understand the problem enough either to be able to 
help. Maybe you could try to find out where is ide_ioport_read called in 
the above and if that's correct to call it there. Also the CMD646U docs 
mention irq in a lot of regs (all say write to clear) but I don't 
understand their relation to each other and irq raised by the drive. I've 
found these:

0x3c INTLINE R/W Interrupt line default=14

0x50 CFR R Configuration register
      bit2 1=interrupt pending, write 1 will clear this bit (in read only reg?)

0x57 ARTTIM23 R/W Drive2/3 Control/Status Register
      bit4 IDE drive 2/3 interrupt status (write 1 to clear)

0x71 or BAR4+1 MRDMODE DMA Master Read Mode Select
      bit2 Primary channel IDE interrupt (write 1 to clear)
      bit3 Secondary channel IDE interrupt (write 1 to clear)
      bit4 Primary channel interrupt enable
           0 = propagate primary channel IDE interrupts to IRQ14 or INTA# pin (default)
           1 = block primary channel IDE interrupts (NOTE: this does not affect the function of bit 2)
      bit5 same as bit4 for but for Secondary channel and IRQ15

0x72 or BAR4+2 R/W BMIDESR0 Bus Master IDE Status Reg 0 for primary channel
      bit2 interrupt generated on IDE bus for DMA transfer (write 1 to clear)

0x7a or BAR4+0xa R/W BMIDESR1 Bus Master IDE Status Reg 0 for secondary channel
      bit2 like BMIDESR0 but for channel 1 I think

So maybe in DMA mode the BM* regs should be used and in legacy mode these 
interrupts would go to ISA IRQ14 and 15 and cleared on read as per the IDE 
spec while in native mode PCI INTA is raised and not cleared but the chip 
docs don't say anything about this so it's only guessing. Does anyone have 
more info on this?
