Title:
  Qemu ARMv7 TCG MultiThreading for i386 guest doesn't work

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Using any Linux image (in this case Alpine Linux iso) I want to
  utilise all cores of my Raspberry with --accel,thread=3Dmulti. I know
  there is a probably still problem with memory ordering of the host,
  but I have also seen some very old commits which could potentially
  help with it.

  But anyway, with version qemu-i386 version 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-7)
  I can see OpenRC starting up services and then the kernel crash.

  With version QEMU emulator version 3.1.93 (v4.0.0-rc3-dirty)
  The whole machine crash with this error:
  Illegal instruction

  Using command:
  ./qemu-system-i386 -cdrom alpine.iso --accel tcg,thread=3Dmulti

  Full Console Output:
  qemu-system-i386: warning: Guest expects a stronger memory ordering than =
the host provides
  This may cause strange/hard to debug errors
  Illegal instruction

  Kernel:
  Linux raspberrypi 4.14.98-v7+ #1200 SMP Tue Feb 12 20:27:48 GMT 2019 armv=
7l GNU/Linux

  CPU:
  ARMv7 Processor rev 5 (v7l)
  Features: half thumb fastmult vfp edsp neon vfpv3 tls vfpv4 idiva idivt v=
fpd32 lpae evtstrm
  4 cores
