well this is a global knob. If this is bot negotiated any unmapped
device can PT.

My assumption above must be wrong as this is a negotiated feature so
anyway the virtio-iommu driver should be involved.

I don't really remember the rationale of the feature bit tbh.

In "[virtio-dev] RE: [RFC] virtio-iommu version 0.4 " Jean discussed
that with Kevein. Sorry I cannot find the link.

" If the endpoint is not attached to any address space,
then the device MAY abort the transaction."

Kevin> From definition of BYPASS, it's orthogonal to whether there is an
address space attached, then should we still allow "May abort" behavior?

Jean> The behavior is left as an implementation choice, and I'm not sure
it's worth enforcing in the architecture. If the endpoint isn't attached
to any domain then (unless VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS is negotiated), it
isn't necessarily able to do DMA at all. The virtio-iommu device may
setup DMA mastering lazily, in which case any DMA transaction would
abort, or have setup DMA already, in which case the endpoint can access
MEM_T_BYPASS regions.

Hopefully Jean will remember and comment on this.

Thanks

Eric
