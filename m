Yes, understood: this is rigorous work that we've failed at before. It's
a big task; but I feel like we are increasingly hurt by our focus on QMP
and leaving HMP in the dust.

Unifying them might be the only reasonable forward-thinking thing, even
if it's hard.

Yes, the "whipupitude" is something I am keen on preserving -- I just
want that whipupitude to be based on a schema.

Can we accomplish this with qmp-shell plugins that use special QMP
interfaces? I think so.

I'm imagining a special feature flag for "experimental" interfaces in
QMP that aren't thought through enough to become real interfaces that
these sugar commands -- implemented primarily in the shell - use.

They might do some bad things: they're synchronous, they might return a
bit too much data, they might return too much data. But it's only for
debug use, and we declare the API unstable/fluid, so we don't care.

Maybe this is a fool's errand, though, and we SHOULD just keep HMP.
Maybe we just need to QAPI-fy our HMP shell so that we can document it
better, and expand QAPI power to describe the format of HMP commands.

The core issue I take with HMP is that it's underdocumented, tends to
rot, and rarely keeps up with configuration idiom changes in QEMU -- it
*feels* like a legacy interface, not an up-to-date debugging interface.

However we fix this is actually not personally important to me.

More or less; but it's still pretty decent as a format if you're editing
it in an IDE that can assist you in doing so.

No editor I am aware of at present is capable of editing JSON or YAML
against a schema, though: the prevailing paradigm appears to be:

- Write file in editor
- Run some validator command
- Deploy and pray

From what I can tell, this is how it works in the cloud world, too.

Yes, but doesn't solve our parsing issue for interactive shells.

Yes.

I wish I had a good idea on how to make a QMP wrapper that works in a
REPL that didn't involve copy/pasting JSON. I guess it's why so many
people *do* just cat data into the socket.
