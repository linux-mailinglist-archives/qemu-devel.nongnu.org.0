I'm wondering about the of tieing CPU versions to the release version
number and whether its a good idea or not ?

Could there be a reason for us to introduce 2 or more variants
of a CPU in the same release & would that be a problem if we needed
todo it ?

Consider if we did not have a Broadwell CPU model defined yet
and we were adding it at the same time as Spectre came out. We
might have needed to add "Broadwell-NN" and "Broadwell-MM" one
with "spec-ctrl" and one without, in order to ensure runability
on hosts with & without the microcode upgrade.  "Broadwell" alias
would resolve to either the NN or MM variant according to what
the current host supported.

One way to cope with that would have been to add a 3rd digit
after the version number. eg a Broadwell-4.1.1 and Broadwell-4.1.2

An alternative could consider using a plain counter for the CPU
versions eg Broadwell-1, Broadwell-2, etc.... ?


If we want to backport the newly added CPU model variants to
exist branches, plain counters don't have the unsightly mismatch.
eg we'd backport Broadwell-3 to QEMU 3.1, not Broadwell-4.1 to
QEMU 3.1.  This isn't a functional problem, just something looking
a bit odd.

Daniel
