Title:
  [feature request] add flag to treat warnings as errors

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Since booting could potentially take a lot of time and warnings are
  likely to indicate that something is wrong, it would be useful to have
  a command line flag which would abort the boot if there are any
  warnings.

  An example might be network configuration. The following output most
  likely indicates that there is something the user has to fix before
  starting and being able to use the guest os.

  Warning: hub port hub0port0 has no peer
  Warning: vlan 0 with no nics
  Warning: netdev hub0port0 has no peer
  Warning: requested NIC (anonymous, model vitrio-net-device) was not creat=
ed (not supported by this machine?)

  Ideally, there would be an option the user could pass which would
  cause qemu to print these warnings then exit, rather than boot the
  kernel.

  Alternatively, or additionally, a dry run option would be helpful for
  the same purpose: making sure qemu get to the booting the kernel stage
  with everything in working order so that you do not have to wait for
  the kernel to boot and then shut down while debugging things like
  networking (things which can be debugged (at least partially) without
  booting, or trying to boot, the guest os).
