Ok, that means we *aren't* talking about -mabi=3Dilp32, which is good --
in my current picolibc implementation, the semihosting code uses a pure
64-bit interface for aarch64 targets, even when using ilp32 ABI.

> How does RISCV specify it?

Because the ISA is identical between 64- and 32- bit (and 128-bit)
execution modes, the only difference between the two is the Machine XLEN
value which encodes the native base integer ISA width. You switch modes
by modifying this value.

I don't know of any implementation in hardware or software that supports
modifying this value. I'm not sure we need to support this in the
semihosting code for qemu as I'm pretty sure getting qemu to support
dynamic XLEN values would be a large project (a project which I don't
personally feel would offer much value).

Title:
  ARM semihosting HEAPINFO results wrote to wrong address

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  This affects latest development branch of QEMU.

  According to the ARM spec of the HEAPINFO semihosting call:

  https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100863/0300/Semihosting-
  operations/SYS-HEAPINFO--0x16-?lang=3Den

  > the PARAMETER REGISTER contains the address of a pointer to a four-
  field data block.

  However, QEMU treated the PARAMETER REGISTER as pointing to a four-
  field data block directly.

  Here is a simple program that can demonstrate this problem:
  https://github.com/iNvEr7/qemu-learn/tree/newlib-bug/semihosting-
  newlib

  This code links with newlib with semihosting mode, which will call the
  HEAPINFO SVC during crt0 routine. When running in QEMU (make run), it
  may crash the program either because of invalid write or memory
  curruption, depending on the compiled program structure.

  Also refer to my discussion with newlib folks:
  https://sourceware.org/pipermail/newlib/2021/018260.html
