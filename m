Yes, seems worth recording that in the commit message (especially
now you've written the text :-)).

Yes. We could change the name of the reference source file that
we have checked into the git repo if you wanted. (The output file
written by Sphinx has to be the same name as the input .rst file AFAICT.)

Close; it turns either CRLF or LF into the host OS's
line-ending sequence (see below).

This is in case the user has a setup that eg has git
doing line-ending conversion on checkout somehow. As a
non-Windows user I opted to be belt-and-braces about
converting both files to a known-consistent line ending.
It's also necessary because the perl rune isn't really
"delete \r"; it's "delete any \r and then output the
line with the OS line ending" because the files it processes
are being read and written in text mode. So the output
will be \r\n on Windows and \n on Unix; the test passes
in both cases because both files have the same
line endings after conversion.
