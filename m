Sorry, I don't have the test code, since this was created by a memory
corruption. However, the way I understand the message is, that there is
some internal disagreement how to decode the op-code "051300009517e2bf"
- which mige be an invalid opcode anyway. So a simple test application
would just consist of this opcode.
