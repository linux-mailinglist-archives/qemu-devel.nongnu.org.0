I've been thinking about this, and I think I agree with Daniel on this.
The 'migration_blockers' list tells you that something about the
*current* state of a device means that it can't be migrated - e.g.
a 9pfs with a mounted filesystem can't be migrated.

If we're about to reload the state from a snapshot, then the saved
snapshot's state must have been migratable, so that's OK.

(Whether all the device code is actually OK about being reset in
that state is a different question; but I think it should be).
