You're right; I misread the line you patch as

     case 3: /* ERL */

You guessed correctly.  Telling me right away that my remark doesn't
make sense to you would've helped :)

The pattern

    case VALUE: /* comment on VALUE */

is common: >8000 instances.

The pattern

    case VALUE /* comment on VALUE */:

is uncommon: <20 instances.  I agree with cleaning it up.

However, I find the common pattern applied here

    case 3: /* ERL */
        /* If EU is set, always unmapped */
        if (eu) {
            return 0;
        }

more readable than the unusual (to my eyes)

    case 3:
        /*
         * ERL
         * If EU is set, always unmapped
         */
        if (eu) {
            return 0;
        }

The first line of the comment applies to the value preceding it, the
second to the code following it.  Making these connections doesn't
exactly take genius, but neither is it effortless.

Nice and consistent coding style is all about reducing the effort of
reading code.

For what it's worth, the pattern

    case VALUE: /* comment on VALUE */
        /* comment on CODE */
        CODE

occurs almost 300 times.

Please consider keeping two separate comments, i.e. just move the colon
to its usual place.

Thanks!
