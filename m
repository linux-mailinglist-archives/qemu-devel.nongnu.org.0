OK, let's add them alongside a tox/pytest configuration or something in 
the future when we add those versions as being supported.

I guess I can add the 3.6 version for starters, since it's explicitly 
supported?

For builds at all?

I guess we could, yeah, if we wanted to start making a "build venv" and 
install it there. I think there's a lot of questions to work out there 
first, though. I am not really there yet, myself.

Right now, *right now*, all of this code is used only for testing and 
CI, so we've skirted around build requirements.

I did want to start picking up some other packages though, like 'qapi', 
for the purposes of applying the linter paradigm though ... and I 
figured I'd cross that bridge when I got there.

Right now, having a forwarder script with a sys.path hack works.

(Probably by the time we figure that out, setuptools 39 will be standard 
on all of our supported build platforms...)

I can use CentOS, sure. I don't think it matters tremendously whose 
Python 3.6 we use. I opted for Fedora because we package old python 
interpreters on purpose, which makes it easy to say "I want Python3.6 
and not a drop older or newer."

I assume the same is true on CentOS. We can talk about this on the CI 
series; though I will likely merge these two series into one for future 
revisions.

I don't have a framework in mind for doing python version matrix testing 
yet. I guess tox is the canonical tool for that. We can cross that 
bridge when we get there, I guess. (We currently have: 0 tests for the 
qemu python library. oops!)

For the meantime, though, I think it's OK to only run the linter on 
Python 3.6: it's not a test of the package itself, it's just a specific 
environment that we use to enforce code quality. It so happens to be a 
Python 3.6 environment. Pinning it to a specific version of python there 
is useful because the linters *do* sometimes have different behavior 
depending on version; due largely in part to changes in the stdlib 
typing library.
