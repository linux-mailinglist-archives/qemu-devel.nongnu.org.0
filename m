QAPI 'if' is a pragmatic design balancing simplicty with expressiveness.

It's part of the QAPI language except for the actual conditions.  The
QAPI generator blindly wraps whatever it generates for the thing
carrying an 'if': 'COND' in #if COND ... #endif /* COND */.  In other
words, we express "what is conditional" in the QAPI language, but resort
to the C language for expressing the actual conditionals.

PRO:
* Supports arbitrary #if.
* QAPI language impact is light: just another (string-valued) property
  of definitions and members.
* Generated code is the same regardless of QEMU configuration.

CON:
* Generating anything but C is problematic.  Currently that's just
  documentation.  Having C conditionals there isn't exactly great, but
  tolerable.

I think Kevin's point is that QAPI can't fully describe QOM.

Let's talk specifics.  Here's how QAPI defines blockdev-add:

    { 'command': 'blockdev-add', 'data': 'BlockdevOptions', 'boxed': true }
    { 'union': 'BlockdevOptions',
      'base': { 'driver': 'BlockdevDriver',
                [...]
                '*detect-zeroes': 'BlockdevDetectZeroesOptions' },
      'discriminator': 'driver',
      'data': {
          'blkdebug':   'BlockdevOptionsBlkdebug',
          'blklogwrites':'BlockdevOptionsBlklogwrites',
          [...]
          'vxhs':       'BlockdevOptionsVxHS'
      } }
    { 'enum': 'BlockdevDriver',
      'data': [ 'blkdebug', 'blklogwrites', [...], 'vxhs' ] }

QAPI specifies the available blockdev object types and their properties,
with types.

Compare object-add:

    { 'command': 'object-add',
      'data': {'qom-type': 'str', 'id': 'str', '*props': 'any'} }

QAPI specifies neither the available QOM object types, nor their
properties.  Consequently, QAPI/QMP introspection tells you nothing
about them.  You need to use QOM introspection instead.  qom-list-types
shows what QOM object types are available, and qom-list-properties shows
an object type's properties.  Except for dynamic ones created only after
object creation).  With undocumented type name strings instead of types.

We already do: QMP command qom-set.  If it breaks your guest, you get to
keep the pieces.

QAPI specifies a certain kind of data types.

QOM "specifies" data types as an imperative program for creating them.
Maximally flexible, and fundamentally at odds with static analysis.
I've hated this since day one.

There's no hard reason why QOM could not specify static aspects
declaratively.  It just doesn't, and changing it now would be a
monumental task.

The imperative program mostly creates identical data types every time.
In other words, the data types are static.  Two problems.  One,
converting such a program to an equivalent declaration takes manual
labor.  Two, there are exceptions, and identifying them is more manual
labor.

Yes, if the QAPI fairy gives us a declarative specification equivalent
to the existing imperative one, then replacing the hand-written
imperative code by code generated from the declarative specification
would be relatively simple.

QAPI data types are static.

QOM types are not.  They're effectively almost static in practice.

Kevin's talking about the imperative code creating different QOM
properties depending on how and in what context it is run.

QOM is perfectly capable of supporting a QMP command to add arbitrary
QOM properties to an object at run time, or even add arbitrary QOM
types, but as you wrote we don't want that.

We don't want management applications to add QOM properties for their
own purposes.

Look for object_property_add*().  Some 450 hits.

    qom: Allow properties to be registered against classes
   =20
    When there are many instances of a given class, registering
    properties against the instance is wasteful of resources. The
    majority of objects have a statically defined list of possible
    properties, so most of the properties are easily registerable
    against the class. Only those properties which are conditionally
    registered at runtime need be recorded against the klass.
   =20
    Registering properties against classes also makes it possible
    to provide static introspection of QOM - currently introspection
    is only possible after creating an instance of a class, which
    severely limits its usefulness.
   =20
    This impl only supports simple scalar properties. It does not
    attempt to allow child object / link object properties against
    the class. There are ways to support those too, but it would
    make this patch more complicated, so it is left as an exercise
    for the future.
   =20
    There is no equivalent to object_property_del() provided, since
    classes must be immutable once they are defined.
