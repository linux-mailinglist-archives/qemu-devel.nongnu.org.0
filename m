(1) is the better approach I think.  That way you can give better
feedback to the user, along the lines of "download 2 of 5 in progress".
Also it allows for better management of the assets, you can have tools
to list them / fetch them / copy them from one to another test machine
/ find & cleanup obsolete assets (i.e. Fedora 28 kernel after switching
tests to Fedora 29).

(2) is probably still useful, to report phases of longer running
tests and maybe have separate timeouts for each phase.  But for
assets I think approach (1) is better than a "download asset"
phase.

cheers,
  Gerd
