I'm not sure we confirmed that this is actually an example of a device
performing DMA to its own MMIO. Unless I am missing something, the BLOAD
example simply performs repeated writes to VRAM?

That said video-related devices seem like possible candidates where such
behavior is conceivable. But even in those cases, the memory regions
would likely be ram/rom devices (which are excluded from the re-entrancy
check).
