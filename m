What use case is that? This updated function now has the assumption that:

1. dram_size being 0 meaning contiguous system RAM region from dram_base
2. otherwise dram_size being the *first* contiguous system RAM region
from dram_base

We can use g_assert(dram_size < ms->ram_size) to catch either case.
