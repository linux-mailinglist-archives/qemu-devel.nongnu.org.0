Hi, Thank you for your review.

For now,
i. if we query the value before any rate has been measured, it will return unstarted,
   and dirtyrate will return -1.
{"return":{"status":"unstarted","dirty-rate":-1,"start-time":0,"calc-time":0},"id":"libvirt-14"}

ii.if we specify the measurement interval like -1 or 61, it will return error
{"id":"libvirt-13","error":{"class":"GenericError","desc":"calc-time is out of range[1, 60]."}}

iii. We can query the last measured dirty rate at any time now as you expected in last patch version
     with returning the measurement timestamp and calc-time.

If i have missed some other scenes, please let me know:)

That's why we restrict the maximum time to 60s, i think this is enough and also
not too long for user to observe the average dirty rate.
I think it is may a little expensive and hardly used to implement cancellation mechanism.

On the other hand, users could call several times with the measurement interval
like 1s, to improve its accuracy otherwise observe a long time.
