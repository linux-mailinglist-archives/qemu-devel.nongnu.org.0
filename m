Can we make it NULL for coroutine-enabled handlers?

error_report() eventually prints to stderr both for cur_mon =3D=3D NULL and
for QMP monitors. Is there an important difference between both cases?

There is error_vprintf_unless_qmp(), which behaves differently for both
cases. However, it is only used in VNC code, so that code would have to
keep coroutines disabled.

Is cur_mon used much in other functions called by QMP handlers?

That sounds painful enough that I'd rather avoid it.
