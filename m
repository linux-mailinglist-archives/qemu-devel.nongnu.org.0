gdb has a dynamic sized packet buffer. Remote protocol doc says:

=E2=80=98qSupported [:gdbfeature [;gdbfeature]=E2=80=A6 ]=E2=80=99
    [...] Any GDB which sends a =E2=80=98qSupported=E2=80=99 packet suppo=
rts receiving
packets of unlimited length (earlier versions of GDB may reject overly
long responses).
