OK thanks, looks like something like this works:

Mark, do you think this could replace the current way of passing this 
driver via fw_cfg and would you accept patches to OpenBIOS to revert the 
ndrv patching to replace that with this solution? (The vga_config_cb 
already adds the driver from the ROM when set as above so no further hacks 
are necessary. If we want we can keep the vga-ndrv? option to control this 
adding NDRV from ROM after the current use of this setting is no longer 
needed.) I think this would allow some simplification and also avoids 
patching ati-vga with this driver without needing to add vga-ndrv?=false 
manually. (In the future this same way can also be used to pass proper 
FCode ROMs to OpenBIOS.)
