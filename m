Did not want to reply to this to not bring it to your attention before 
patch gets in finally but it's too late...

Not sure what you refer to but in this particular case the problem only 
seems to be load_elf loading 32 bit ELF files returning sign extended 64 
bit address which looks bogus but since this function is widely used I did 
not feel confident enough to propose a patch to load_elf.

By the way, also the parameters of load_elf could take a clean up to 
remove all the mostly NULL values as I've pointed out before:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-01/msg03427.html

but all this could wait until later, these don't seem to be urgent 
problems to prevent moving mac machines forward now and could all be 
addressen in separate elf loading series. So just note the problem and 
move on for now please.

Reagards.
