First of all, thank you for all your feedbacks

Please help me to summarize and let us understand better what we do in v2:
Major questions are:
1. Building eBPF from source during qemu build vs. regenerating it on
demand and keeping in the repository
Solution 1a (~ as in v1): keep instructions or ELF in H file, generate it
out of qemu build. In general we'll need to have BE and LE binaries.
Solution 1b: build ELF or instructions during QEMU build if llvm + clang
exist. Then we will have only one (BE or LE, depending on current QEMU
build)
We agree with any solution - I believe you know the requirements better.

2. Use libbpf or not
In general we do not see any advantage of using libbpf. It works with
object files (does ELF parsing at time of loading), but it does not do any
magic.
Solution 2a. Switch to libbpf, generate object files (LE and BE) from
source, keep them inside QEMU (~8k each) or aside
Solution 2b. (as in v1) Use python script to parse object -> instructions
(~2k each)
We'd prefer not to use libbpf at the moment.
If due to some unknown reason we'll find it useful in future, we can switch
to it, this does not create any incompatibility. Then this will create a
dependency on libbpf.so

3. Keep instructions or ELF inside QEMU or as separate external file
Solution 3a (~as in v1): Built-in array of instructions or ELF. If we
generate them out of QEMU build - keep 2 arrays or instructions or ELF (BE
and LE),
Solution 3b: Install them as separate files (/usr/share/qemu).
We'd prefer 3a:
 Then there is a guarantee that the eBPF is built with exactly the same
config structures as QEMU (qemu creates a mapping of its structures, eBPF
uses them).
 No need to take care on scenarios like 'file not found', 'file is not
suitable' etc

4. Is there some real request to have the eBPF for big-endian?
If no, we can enable eBPF only for LE builds

Jason, Daniel, Michael
Can you please let us know what you think and why?

BPF ioctl was used to set the eBPF program.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; Added eBPF support to qem=
u directly through a system call, see the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; bpf(2) for details.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; The eBPF program is part =
of the qemu and presented as an array<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; I am sending those patche=
s as RFC to initiate the discussions<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 and get<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; feedback on the following=
 points:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; * Fallback when eBPF is n=
ot supported by the kernel<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Yes, and it could also a lacki=
ng of CAP_BPF.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; * Live migration to the k=
ernel that doesn&#39;t have eBPF support<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Is there anything that we need=
s special treatment here?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Possible case: rss=3Don, vhost=3Don, source system=
 with kernel 5.8<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (everything works) -&gt; dest. system 5.6 (bpf doe=
s not work), the adapter<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functions, but all the steering does not use prope=
r queues.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right, I think we need to disable vhost on dest.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &gt; * Integration with curren=
t QEMU build<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Yes, a question here:<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 1) Any reason for not using li=
bbpf, e.g it has been shipped with some<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 distros<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We intentionally do not use libbpf, as it present =
only on some distros.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can switch to libbpf, but this will disable bpf=
 if libbpf is not<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; installed<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s better I think.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 2) It would be better if we ca=
n avoid shipping bytecodes<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This creates new dependencies: llvm=C2=A0+ clang=
=C2=A0+ ...<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We would prefer byte code and ability to generate =
it if prerequisites<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are installed.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s probably ok if we treat the bytecode as a kind=
 of firmware.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is explicitly *not* OK for inclusion in Fedora. They re=
quire that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BPF is compiled from source, and rejected my suggestion that=
 it could<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be considered a kind of firmware and thus have an exception =
from building<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from source.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Please refer what it was done in DPDK:<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; <a href=3D"http://git.dpdk.org/dpdk/tree/doc/guides/nics/tap.rst#=
n235" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://git.dpdk.org/dpdk/tree/do=
c/guides/nics/tap.rst#n235</a><br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think what proposed here makes anything different.<br=
>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I&#39;m not convinced that what DPDK does is acceptable to Fedora eith=
er<br>
&gt; based on the responses I&#39;ve received when asking about BPF handlin=
g<br>
&gt; during build.=C2=A0 I wouldn&#39;t suprise me, however, if this was si=
mply<br>
&gt; missed by reviewers when accepting DPDK into Fedora, because it is<br>
&gt; not entirely obvious unless you are looking closely.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I&#39;m pushing back against the idea that we have to compile the<br>
BPF code from master source, as I think it is reasonable to have the<br>
program embedded as a static array in the source code similar to what<br>
DPDK does.=C2=A0 It doesn&#39;t feel much different from other places where=
 apps<br>
use generated sources, and don&#39;t build them from the original source<br=
>
every time. eg &quot;configure&quot; is never re-generated from &quot;<a hr=
ef=3D"http://configure.ac" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">configure.a=
c</a>&quot;<br>
by Fedora packagers, they just use the generated &quot;configure&quot; scri=
pt<br>
as-is.<br>
<br>
