Welcome to a classic optimization triangle:

  - speed -> direct mappings
  - security -> restricted mapping
  - simplicity -> static mapping

Pick two, you can't have them all. Well, you could try a little bit more 
of one, at the price of losing on another. But that's it.

We chose the last two, ending up with probably the simplest but not 
fastest solution for type-1 hypervisors like Jailhouse. Specifically for 
non-Linux use cases, legacy RTOSes, often with limited driver stacks, 
having not only virtio but also even simpler channels over 
application-defined shared memory layouts is a requirement.

I'm with you regarding stacks that are mappable not only on QEMU/Linux. 
And also one that does not let the certification costs sky-rocket 
because of its mandated implementation complexity.

I'm not sure anymore if there will be only one device model. Maybe we 
should eventually think about a backend layer that can sit on something 
like virtio-vhost-user as well as on ivshmem-virtio, allowing the same 
device backend code to be plumbed into both transports. Why shouldn't 
work what already works well under Linux with the frontend device 
drivers vs. virtio transports?
