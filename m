Title:
  Regressions on arm target with some GCC tests

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  Hi,

  After trying qemu master:
  commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
  Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
  Author: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>
  Date:   Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

  I found several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GCC tes=
tsuite.
  I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed s=
hared libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

  All tests used to pass w/o error (one of them is verbose), but with a
  recent qemu, all of them make qemu crash:

  qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped

  This was noticed with GCC master configured with
  --target arm-none-linux-gnueabi
  --with-mode arm
  --with-cpu cortex-a9

  and calling qemu with --cpu cortex-a9 (the script uses "any", this
  makes no difference).

  I have noticed other failures with arm-v8 code, but this is probably
  the same root cause. Since it's a bit tedious to manually rebuild &
  extract the testcases, I'd prefer to start with this subset, and I can
  extract more if needed later.

  Thanks
