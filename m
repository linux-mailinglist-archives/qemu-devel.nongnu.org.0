Understood.  Thanks!

Oh, that's the info I was missing.  I always expected
kvm_arch_get_supported_*() to be subject to change (depending on
KVM and hardware capabilities), and not be part of guest ABI.

Now, if KVM is going to to implement the guest ABI guarantee at
KVM_GET_MSRS, that's OK.  Is this going to be obvious to people
touching KVM_GET_MSRS in the future?

What if we do want the guest ABI to change in the future?  How do
you expect QEMU to ask KVM to enable the new guest ABI?  How do
you expect the user to ask QEMU to enable the new guest ABI?

The complex rules above make me a bit nervous.  Can we at least
make QEMU validate the values returned by
kvm_arch_get_supported_msr_feature() to catch ABI-breaking
mistakes in the future?
