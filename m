You'll probably want to add that file to an index as well, so that it
gets built properly.

Please lengthen the underlining :)

Also, it might improve readability of the text doc if you added an
empty line beneath the headers.

`prot_virt=1`, so that it gets rendered as a literal in html?

Add an example invocation here?

Underlining too long :)

Hm... do you have an ETA for that tbd program?
