I've tried it now again with both ppc and ppc64: both OpenBIOS and a G3 
beige ROM can be loaded with qemu-system-ppc but qemu-system-ppc64 fails 
with OpenBIOS when casting to target_ulong (i think because target_ulong 
is 64 bit there but g3beige is still 32 bit but I haven't throughly 
debugged it). But everything works with my original uint32_t cast, so 
ditch it and use my original version. Should I resubmit or you can fix up? 
(I think I wait until it's clear if this will be taken by David or you and 
send a fixed version cc-ing David if this is decided to go through the PPC 
queue.)

BALATON Zoltan
