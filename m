Agreed with all the above. I think something like this would be useful (and not annoying)
only if we could at least limit the false positives by checking that the file effectively includes trace.h or trace-root.h .

Right - if we do end up checking the patched files for this feature though (thus breaking this design rule),
would this have any other consequence beyond providing this feature?

We need to call checkpatch.pl from the top srcdir anyway,
and if we don't find the patched file or we don't match trace.h or trace-root.h in there, well we just don't emit the warning...

Won't insist, would just have found it useful to avoid forgetting that piece when moving stuff around.

Just for kicks I will send an RFC v2 to see what it could look like attempting to look for trace.h and trace-root.h,
probably it's something I would personally use.

Ciao, thanks!
