VNC == RFB - they're two different terms of the same thing.

The core RFB/VNC protocol only knows about keysyms.

Hardware scancodes is an extension defined by QEMU, and GTK-VNC, and since
implemented by TigerVNC.

Removing the "-k" arg, merely enables use of the scancode extension.
This requires a compatible client app that knows the scancode extension.
If the client doesn't support scancodes, it will continue using keysyms,
which will then be treated as plain us keymap.

AFAIK,  TightVNC doesn't support the scancode extension, only TigerVNC.

This is a key example of the problems of VNC's traditional key handling.

QEMU has a single keymap "fr". It has no way of selecting compose key
on/off, or overriding AltGr to be CtrlR.  So as soon as you do that on
your local desktop, you make it impossible to QEMU VNC serve to work
correctly.

It is hard to say without seeing debuging to see what QEMU received.
