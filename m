We had the same issue in vdsm. Someone ported qemu "json" schema to vdsm,
probbay when the plan was to add C API to vdsm, which never happened.

My first patch to vdsm was fixing the parser for this "json" format,
because it used to
get in an endless loop if an unknown token was found. We hated this
format, and finally
replaced it with yaml. But we did not keep the comments since they
duplicate data
which is already in the json part, and not portable to other formats.

Here is the patch adding schema convertor from qemu "json" format to
standard yaml:
https://github.com/oVirt/vdsm/commit/e57b69e72987c0929b20306c454835b52b5eb7=
ee

The current version of the new yaml based schema:
https://github.com/oVirt/vdsm/blob/master/lib/vdsm/api/vdsm-api.yml

We don't use comments, so the yaml is portable to json or regular
python dict. In fact,
we use the schama in as a pickle of the parsed schema for 5 times
faster loading, which
is important since we use the schema in the command line client.

Having the comments part of the schema allows nice things like
verifying requests and
generating help messages directly from the schema. This is not a good
example before
our implementation is poor, but:

$ vdsm-client Host getDeviceList -h
usage: vdsm-client Host getDeviceList [-h] [arg=3Dvalue [arg=3Dvalue ...]]

positional arguments:
  arg=3Dvalue   storageType: Only return devices of this type
              guids: Only return info on specific list of block device GUID=
s
              checkStatus: Indicates if device status should be checked


              JSON representation:
              {
                  "storageType": {
                      "BlockDeviceType": "enum ['FCP', 'MIXED', 'iSCSI']"
                  },
                  "guids": [
                      "string",
                      {}
                  ],
                  "checkStatus": "boolean"
              }

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

vdsm-client knows nothing about vdsm API and we never have to change
it, because it generates
the command line interface and the help messages from the schema on
the fly, and its input and
output is json.

vdsm/client.py is similar, providing vdsm API without knowing anything
about the API, or requiring
changes when APIs are added or modified, because everything is done by
inspecting the schema:

>>> from vdsm import client
>>> c =3D client.connect("localhost")
>>> c.Host.getDeviceList(storageType=3D"FCP", checkStatus=3DFalse)
[]
>>> print(c.Host)
<vdsm.client.Namespace object at 0x7fcda017fa58>
>>> print(c.Host.getDeviceList)
functools.partial(<bound method _Client._call of <vdsm.client._Client
object at 0x7fcda757e0f0>>, 'Host', 'getDeviceList')

I think inventing DSLs and developing tools is wrong. Use standard
format and tools and spend
time on the core of the project.
