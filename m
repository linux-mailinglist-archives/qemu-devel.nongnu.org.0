I've modified the libvirt code I have to try this. It works as expected
without iothreads, but I get the following error when iothread is used:

 error: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'transaction': Canno=
t change iothread of active block backend

I've tested it also with your Aio context patches for blockdev-reopen
applied and also added a feature flag for blockdev-snapshot

 https://gitlab.com/pipo.sk/qemu/-/commits/kevin-snapshot-blockcopy

I can post the feature patch if you want after I clean it up or perhaps
suggest a better name or wording for it.

The libvirt code is a subset of

 https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2020-February/msg01125.html

with the blockdev-reopen bits removed and replaced by blockdev-snapshot.

You can have a look at the libvirt impl here:

 https://gitlab.com/pipo.sk/libvirt/-/commits/block-copy-reopen-snapshot

I'll post it for review if it's clear that iothreads can be supported
using this approach.
