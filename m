What if the kernel is waiting for QEMU to drop support too ;-P

RHEL dropped all 32-bit host support a long time ago, so Red Hat
don't care for our products.

Fedora has recently stopped building i686 kernels and thus also no
long composes i686 installs. Some users complained, but ultimately
no one cares enough to step forward as maintainers.

That leaves armv7 as the only 32-bit arch in Fedora that is somewhat
active & maintained. I don't have any real insight on whether any
armv7 (Fedora) users are making much use of QEMU/KVM though, either
system or user emulation.=20

Our preference in Fedora is to have things built on every architecture
that the distro targets, but if upstream developers explicitly drop an
architecture we're not going to try to add it back.

Daniel
