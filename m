Oh, I didn't even think of this kind of core.*!

I imagine in practice it wouldn't be so bad to have a monitor/core.c
because it's in a subdirectory, and it's under version control anyway.
We already seem to have quite a few of them in subdirectories:

    ./hw/acpi/core.c
    ./hw/bt/core.c
    ./hw/cpu/core.c
    ./hw/i2c/core.c
    ./hw/ide/core.c
    ./hw/sd/core.c
    ./hw/usb/core.c

But I'll gladly rename it if I can find a good name. Do you have any
suggestions? Maybe just monitor/monitor.c?

Kevin
