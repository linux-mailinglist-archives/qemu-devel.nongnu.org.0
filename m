Hi Peter, (+Ard)

Graeme is on holiday this week, and I would like his input.

Would it? Could it be something that goes into the virt spec?
We don't consume ACPI in firmware (but TF-A will of course have access
to the DT regardless).

For sbsa-ref, I would ideally like to move to emulating communicating
with an SCP over time, as opposed to TF-A directly controlling the EC.
I am unsure if that leaves much opportunity for code sharing with
virt.

Ard: is this a config supported/able by ArmVirtPkg?

Best Regards,

Leif
