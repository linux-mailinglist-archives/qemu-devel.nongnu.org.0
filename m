Hi Stefan,

Thanks for your response.

We didn=E2=80=99t quite get the purpose of the =E2=80=9Cobject=E2=80=9D =
when you proposed the
command-line. But we understand it now.

We also agree to wait for the authentication protocol before enabling
multiple devices in the same remote process. Therefore we have limited
the number of devices to 1.

Even with one device, we still had the problem of attaching the file
descriptor with a device int the remote end. The object idea you =
proposed
seemed to fit well with connecting the fd with device. We have added =
this
object in v8, which we just sent out.

We have dropped the main-socket/control-channel as it=E2=80=99s not =
needed
anymore.

We look forward to your responses to v8.

Thank you very much!
