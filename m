Fair enough.

But taking a step back: What's the purpose of the new exits, then?
IIUC, we have the following cases:

- code 4: normal guest, nothing special
- code 104: protected guest, emulate the instruction
- code 108: protected guest, notification for the instruction

The backend code can figure out what to do simply by checking whether
the guest is protected or not (as whatever needs to be done is simply
determined by that anyway).

Are we overlooking something? Or is the information contained in the
different exits simply redundant?
