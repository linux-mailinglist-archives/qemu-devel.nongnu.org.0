Back to the cache problem, I started to ask 2 years ago,
https://www.mail-archive.com/avocado-devel@redhat.com/msg00860.html

We discussed about this again last year at the KVM forum. Various
RFE have been filled:
https://www.mail-archive.com/avocado-devel@redhat.com/msg01183.html


What we need is a QEMU community file server similar to the asset
one used by the Avocado community. The problem is who is going to
pay and sysadmin it. IIRC Gerd suggested to use GitLab Page, but
the artifact file size is limited to a maximum of 1GiB:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/#gitlab-pages
Alternative is to use a git-lfs server:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/#hosting-lfs-objects-externally
This is now a project management problem.

Next week is the KVM forum 2020 and there might be a BoF session
to talk about that:
https://kvmforum2020.sched.com/overview/type/Birds+of+a+Feather+Sessions+(BoF)


Now that the QEMU community started to use gitlab-ci more and more
I received complains that Avocado is not practical (hard to
understand how to reproduce command line to debug, options to use
not clear, timeouts not clear, why download all artifacts to run
a single test, various issues regarding caching, cache filled /home
filesystem) so I have been asked to look at Avocado alternatives,
because we want contributors run more tests and CI, not them be
scared by it.
I haven't looked at alternatives yet, from the various features
we could have use, the biggest one is the ability to interact with
the serial console. And that feature is duplicated with the VM
testing class: tests/vm/basevm.py.
The SSH session used in linux_ssh_mips_malta.py is similar to the
one from basevm.py too (see 'make vm-boot-ssh-%').
Some tests are not 'acceptance' but simple qtest written in Python,
such cpu_queries.py / pc_cpu_hotplug_props.py / migration.py /
pc_cpu_hotplug_props.py / x86_cpu_model_versions.py.

The classes I find practical are downloading artifact, uncompressing
or extracting archive, and eventually the cloudinit one. But we can 
probably use them directly.


Lot of material to discuss :)

Regards,

Phil.
