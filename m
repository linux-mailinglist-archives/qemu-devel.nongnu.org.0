There's another urgent point which I completely forget to mention in my 
patch description (not sure how I managed that, since it's bugging me quite 
badly in the past weeks): We're struggling heavily with CI minutes. If we 
have to support multiple major releases for a long time in parallel, there 
will always be the desire to have all major releases also tested in the CI 
... and honestly, we're really struggling quite badly there right now - as 
you know, we've already run out of CI minutes in January in the main 
project, and also in my forked repo I'm struggling each month. Additionally, 
it's of course additional effort to keep everything in the "green" state the 
more you have to support.

We're currently "lucky" in a sense that we're only testing one version of 
CentOS, Debian and Ubuntu right now, but there have been voices in the past 
weeks asking for more already (like we also did in the past already). I'd 
really appreciate if we could have a clearer policy here to support less at 
the same time. It would help with the pressure on the CI and the effort and 
time it takes to maintain all that stuff.

  Thomas
