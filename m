Title:
  User mode networking not working properly on QEMU on Mac OS X host

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Steps to reproduce:

  1. Install QEMU using homebrew on Mac OS X (I tried on Catalina and Big S=
ur)
  2. Spin up a guest VM (say) Cent OS 8 using user mode networking.
  3. Install podman inside the guest
  4. Run podman pull alpine

  The result is:

  [root@localhost ~]# podman pull alpine
  Resolved "alpine" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnam=
es.conf)
  Trying to pull docker.io/library/alpine:latest...
  Getting image source signatures

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D] 2.7M=

  =C2=A0=C2=A0unexpected EOF
  Error: Error writing blob: error storing blob to file "/var/tmp/storage85=
1171596/1": error happened during read: unexpected EOF

  This is happening because QEMU is telling the guest that the TCP
  connection is closed even before reading all the data from the host
  socket and forwarding it to the guest.

  This issue doesn't happen on a Linux host. So, that tells me that this
  has something to do with QEMU installation on Mac OS X.

  This could be a slirp related issue. So, QEMU/slirp may need to work
  together on fixing this. Here's the link to the libslirp issue:
