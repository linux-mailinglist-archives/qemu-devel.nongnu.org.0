But don't all other jobs allow you to see intermediate states? Like,
when you look at the target node in the middle of a mirror job, you'll
see a half-updated target image.

If we have an actual use case for both modes, we can certainly support
that, but do we have one?

I'm not sure for what the busy flag is used in detail, but if this is
the problem, maybe it's possible to just replace it with a counter?
