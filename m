Wait a sec, the vfio API essentially deconstructs devices into exactly
the resources you've outlined above.  We not only have a vfio-pci
device convention within vfio, but we've defined vfio-platform,
vfio-amba, vfio-ccw, vfio-ap, and we'll likely be adding vfio-fsl-mc in
the next kernel.  The core device, group, and container model within
vfio is completely device/bus agnostic.  So while it's true that
vfio-pci is the most mature and featureful convention, that's largely a
reflection that PCI is the most ubiquitous device interface currently
available.  Thanks,

Alex
