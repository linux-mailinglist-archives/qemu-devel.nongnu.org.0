Title:
  savevm with hax saves wrong register state

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I use qemu-i386 with IntelHaxm on Windows 10 x64 host with Windows 7 x86 =
guest. I run the guest till OS loads and create a snapshot with savevm, the=
n close qemu, run it again and try to load the snapshot with loadvm. The gu=
est crashes or freezes. I dumped registers on snapshot creation and loading=
 (in Haxm) and found that they are different.
  When returning from Haxm in hax_vcpu_hax_exec, there is no regular regist=
er read. I found hax_arch_get_registers function which reads registers from=
 Haxm and is called from a synchronization procedure. I placed a breakpoint=
 on it, ran qemu and found that it is hit one time during guest OS boot. Ex=
actly these registers where saved in the snapshot.
