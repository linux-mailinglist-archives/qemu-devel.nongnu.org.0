So at the high level the idea was simple, we just clear the dirty bit
when page is hinted, unless we sent a new command since. Implementation
was reviewed by migration maintainers. If there's a consensus the code
is written so badly we can't maintain it, maybe we should remove it.
Which parts are unmaintainable in your eyes - migration or virtio ones?
Or maybe it's the general thing that interface was never specced
properly.

I'll reply to that now.

The assumption hinting makes is that data in page is writtent to before it's used.

I think it's basically simple: hinting means it's ok to
fill page with trash unless it has been modified since the command
ID supplied.

Absolutely.

Reset is notoriously hard to get right.

So that would be a performance issue you are suggesting, right?

I don't know how to find out. So far it doesn't look like we found
any common data corruptions that would indicate no one can use it safely.
Races around reset aren't all that uncommon but I don't think that
qualifies as a deal breaker.

I find the idea of asynchronously sending hints to host without
waiting for them to be processed intriguing. Not something
I'd work on implementing if we had reporting originally,
but since it's there I'm not sure we should just discard it
at this point.

I did my best but obviously missed some things.
