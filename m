Surely you're joking, Mr. Snow!

I'm chipping away at pylint's gripes.  I ran it with the following
messages disabled:

    bad-whitespace,
    fixme,
    invalid-name,
    missing-docstring,
    too-few-public-methods,
    too-many-arguments,
    too-many-branches,
    too-many-instance-attributes,
    too-many-lines,
    too-many-locals,
    too-many-statements,
    unused-argument,
    unused-wildcard-import,

These are not all obviously useless.  They're just not what I want to
focus on right now.

Remaining:

1 x C0330: Wrong continued indentation (remove 19 spaces).

    Accident, will fix in v2.

8 x R0201: Method could be a function (no-self-use)

    Yes, but the override in a sub-class does use self.

2 x W0212: Access to a protected member _body of a client class (protected-=
access)

    Needs cleanup, but not now.

6 x W0401: Wildcard import qapi.common (wildcard-import)

    Not sure I care.  I'd prefer not to have more wildcard imports,
    though.

2 x W0603: Using the global statement (global-statement)

    Cleanup is non-trivial.  Not now.

I also ran pycodestyle-3:

1 x E127 continuation line over-indented for visual indent

    Same as pylint's C0330, will fix in v2.

3 x E261 at least two spaces before inline comment

    I blame Emacs.  Left for another day.

8 x E501 line too long

    Left for another day.

1 x E713 test for membership should be 'not in'

    I missed that one, will fix in v2.

Working towards it, slowly.

Thanks!
