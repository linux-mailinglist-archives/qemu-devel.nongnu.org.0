Title:
  [RFE] option to suppress gemu_log() output

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  With user mode emulation, messages from genu_log() are emitted
  unconditionally to stderr. I didn't find a way to suppress them. It
  would be nice to have options similar to the -D/-d options to be able
  to filter and/or redirect the output.

  My use case is chroot/container execution for different architectures
  via binfmt. In this case it will appear as if the binary in question
  had emitted messages like "Unsupported setsockopt ..." to stderr while
  in fact the message came from qemu-*-static.
