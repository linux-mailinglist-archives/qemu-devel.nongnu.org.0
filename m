I agree with this. If a user is changing a DTB from a command line
they probably only want small changes and are unlikely to need the
full power of an overlay.

This though sounds interesting :)

At first I'm not thrilled of adding a new loader. In saying that,
there are lots of times where -kernel and friends doesn't do what I
want it to do and I have to fall back to the generic loader and code
changes to QEMU so maybe this is a good idea for image loading.

I'm guessing this would be the same for every platform which would be
a nice change from -kernel.
