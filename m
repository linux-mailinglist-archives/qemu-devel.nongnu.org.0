Thanks for looking into this QEMU series. I am glad to hear that this
work looks sensible at least :)

Agreed. it is required. Since, MPIDR derived using topo specified by
the user should match that assigned by the KVM/Host(which derives it
using vcpu-id).=20

Yes, kind-of, if you actually see the KVM logic and how it derives the
MPIDR for vcpu in reset_mpidr() you will know that the only variable
it is using is vcpu-id which is specified by QEMU during the vcpu
creation time. This clearly means end MPIDR value is actually dependent
on QEMU and KVM/host just programs it. Of course user of the QEMU does
not have any direct interface and this is as of now done implicitly
at QEMU level.=20

But the thing which concerned me was the idea of threads. Marc recently
clarified about that aspect as well, that KVM always(with some exception
of thunderX) uses MT=3D0(a bit in MPIDR register) even for the hardware
which support threads. IMHO there has to be some way to distinguish
between threads and cores at the QEMU level whether QEMU fetches this
info using sysfs interface like lscpu etc does or devise some other way.
But QEMU should ensure that right thread/core info is being facilitated
to the guest kernel. This could either be done wrapped as part of the
MPIDR or PPTT Table.

Ok. We need to modify the logic to derive the arch-id/MPIDR using the
topology info instead of just vcpu-id. Hope you will be doing that
as well for TCG? and this will require check to distinguish the KVM and
TCG part there as well. I am specifically talking about {pre|post}_plug
functions. BTW, can 'N' (in -smp N) ever be sockets?


In case you require my help for anything like testing on real ARM64
server hardware or anything else please give a nudge and we can co-work
from here :)


Regarding kernel part, I will be posting the guest kernel changes
today to the community. If you have time please have a look at them
as well.


Many thanks
Salil.
