That's intentional.  That portion of the guest-visible data reads as 
zero (BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO set) but was NOT read from the top layer, but 
rather synthesized by the block layer because it derived from the 
backing file but was beyond EOF of that backing layer 
(BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED is clear).

Do you have a reproducer for this?  In my experience, this is not 
possible.  Generally, if you request status that overlaps EOF of the 
backing, you get a response truncated to the end of the backing, and you 
are then likely to follow up with a subsequent status request starting 
from the underlying EOF which then sees the desired unallocated zeroes:

back     xxxx
top      yy------
request    ^^^^^^
response   ^^
request      ^^^^
response     ^^^^

This actually sounds like an avoidable regression.  :(

I argue that if we did not explicitly write data/zero clusters in the 
tail of the top layer, then those clusters are not allocated from the 
POV of reading from the backing-chain top.  Yes, we know what their 
contents will be, but we also know what the contents of unallocated 
clusters will be when there is no backing file at all - basically, after 
your other patch series to drop unallocated_blocks_are_zero:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg05429.html
then we know that only format drivers that can support backing files 
even care what allocation means, and 'allocated' strictly means that the 
data comes from the top layer rather than from a backing (whether 
directly from the backing, or synthesized as zero by the block layer 
because it was beyond EOF of the backing).

I'm already not a fan of this patch - it adds lines rather than removes, 
and seems to add a regression.

Why?  If we replaced the backing file to something longer (qemu-img 
rebase -u), we would WANT to read from the backing file.  The only 
reason we read zero is because the block layer synthesized it _while_ 
deferring to the backing layer, not because it was directly allocated in 
the top layer.

No. Reporting 'file' only makes sense if you can point to an offset 
within that file that would read the guest-visible data in question - 
but when the data is synthesized, there is no such offset.

The fact that we no longer see zeroes in the tail of the file makes me 
think this patch is wrong.
