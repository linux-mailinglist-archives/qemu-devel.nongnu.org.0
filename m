-The QEMU maintainers generally recommend that a VPATH build is used by

+The source code is highly modularized, split across many files to
+facilitate building of all of these components with as little duplicated
+compilation as possible. The Meson "sourceset" functionality is used
+to list the files and their dependency on various configuration  
+symbols.
 
+Various subsystems that are common to both tools and emulators have
+their own sourceset, for example block_ss for the block device subsystem,
+chardev_ss for the character device subsystem, etc.  These sourcesets
+are then turned into static libraries as follows:
 
-Module structure
-----------------
+    libchardev = static_library('chardev', chardev_ss.sources(),
+                                name_suffix: 'fa',
+                                build_by_default: false)
 
-There are a number of key outputs of the QEMU build system:
+    chardev = declare_dependency(link_whole: libchardev)
 
- - Tools - qemu-img, qemu-nbd, qga (guest agent), etc
- - System emulators - qemu-system-$ARCH
- - Userspace emulators - qemu-$ARCH
- - Unit tests
+The special ".fa" suffix is needed as long as unit tests are built with
+the older Makefile infrastructure, and will go away later.
 
-The source code is highly modularized, split across many files to
-facilitate building of all of these components with as little duplicated
-compilation as possible. There can be considered to be two distinct
-groups of files, those which are independent of the QEMU emulation
-target and those which are dependent on the QEMU emulation target.
+Files linked into emulator targets there can be split into two distinct groups
+of files, those which are independent of the QEMU emulation target and
+those which are dependent on the QEMU emulation target.
 
 In the target-independent set lives various general purpose helper code,
 such as error handling infrastructure, standard data structures,
 platform portability wrapper functions, etc. This code can be compiled
 once only and the .o files linked into all output binaries.
+Target-independent code lives in the common_ss, softmmu_ss and user_ss
+sourcesets.  common_ss is linked into all emulators, softmmu_ss only
+in system emulators, user_ss only in user-mode emulators.
 
 In the target-dependent set lives CPU emulation, device emulation and
 much glue code. This sometimes also has to be compiled multiple times,
 once for each target being built.
 
-The utility code that is used by all binaries is built into a
-static archive called libqemuutil.a, which is then linked to all the
-binaries. In order to provide hooks that are only needed by some of the
-binaries, code in libqemuutil.a may depend on other functions that are
-not fully implemented by all QEMU binaries.  Dummy stubs for all these
-functions are also provided by this library, and will only be linked
+All binaries link with a static library libqemuutil.a, which is then
+linked to all the binaries.  libqemuutil.a is built from several
+sourcesets; most of them however host generated code, and the only two
+of general interest are util_ss and stub_ss.
+
+The separation between these two is purely for documentation purposes.
+util_ss contains generic utility files.  Even though this code is only
+linked in some binaries, sometimes it requires hooks only in some of
+these and depend on other functions that are not fully implemented by
+all QEMU binaries.  stub_ss links dummy stubs that will only be linked
 into the binary if the real implementation is not present.  In a way,
 the stubs can be thought of as a portable implementation of the weak
 symbols concept.
 
-All binaries should link to libqemuutil.a, e.g.:
+The following files concur in the definition of which files are linked
+into each emulator:
 
- qemu-img$(EXESUF): qemu-img.o ..snip.. libqemuutil.a
+- default-configs/*.mak
 
+The files under default-configs/ control what emulated hardware is built
+into each QEMU system and userspace emulator targets. They merely contain
+a list of config variable definitions like the machines that should be
+included. For example, default-configs/aarch64-softmmu.mak has:
 
-Windows platform portability
-----------------------------
+  include arm-softmmu.mak
+  CONFIG_XLNX_ZYNQMP_ARM=y
+  CONFIG_XLNX_VERSAL=y
 
-On Windows, all binaries have the suffix '.exe', so all Makefile rules
-which create binaries must include the $(EXESUF) variable on the binary
-name. e.g.
+These files rarely need changing unless new devices / hardware need to
+be enabled for a particular system/userspace emulation target
 
- qemu-img$(EXESUF): qemu-img.o ..snip..
+- */Kconfig
 
-This expands to '.exe' on Windows, or '' on other platforms.
+These files are processed together with default-configs/*.mak and
+describe the dependencies between various features, subsystems and
+device models.  They are described in kconfig.rst.
+
+
+Support scripts
+---------------
+
+Meson has a special convention for invoking Python scripts: if their
+first line is "#! /usr/bin/env python3" and the file is *not* executable,
+find_program() arranges to invoke the script under the same Python
+interpreter that was used to invoke Meson.  This is the most common
+and preferred way to invoke support scripts from Meson build files,
+because it automatically uses the value of configure's --python= option.
 
-A further complication for the system emulator binaries is that
-two separate binaries need to be generated.
+In case the script is not written in Python, use a "#! /usr/bin/env ..."
+line and make the script executable.
 
-The main binary (e.g. qemu-system-x86_64.exe) is linked against the
-Windows console runtime subsystem. These are expected to be run from a
-command prompt window, and so will print stderr to the console that
-launched them.
+Scripts written in Python, where it is desirable to make the script
+executable (for example for test scripts that developers may want to
+invoke from the command line, such as tests/qapi-schema/test-qapi.py),
+should be invoked through the "python" variable in meson.build. For
+example:
 
-The second binary generated has a 'w' on the end of its name (e.g.
-qemu-system-x86_64w.exe) and is linked against the Windows graphical
-runtime subsystem. These are expected to be run directly from the
-desktop and will open up a dedicated console window for stderr output.
+  test('QAPI schema regression tests', python,
+       args: files('test-qapi.py'),
+       env: test_env, suite: ['qapi-schema', 'qapi-frontend'])
 
-The Makefile.target will generate the binary for the graphical subsystem
-first, and then use objcopy to relink it against the console subsystem
-to generate the second binary.
+This is needed to obey the --python= option passed to the configure
+script, which may point to something other than the first python3
+binary on the path.
 
 
-Object variable naming
-----------------------
+Stage 3: makefiles
+==================
+
+The use of GNU make is required with the QEMU build system.
+
+The output of Meson is a build.ninja file, which is used with the Ninja
+build system.  QEMU uses a different approach, where Makefile rules are
+synthesized from the build.ninja file.  The main Makefile includes these
+rules and wraps them so that e.g. submodules are built before QEMU.
+The resulting build system is largely non-recursive in nature, in
+contrast to common practices seen with automake.
+
+Tests are also ran by the Makefile with the traditional "make check"
+phony target.  Meson test suites such as "unit" can be ran with "make
+check-unit" too.  It is also possible to run tests defined in meson.build
+with "meson test".
+
+The following text is only relevant for unit tests which still have to
+be converted to Meson.
+
+All binaries should link to libqemuutil.a, e.g.:
+
+   qemu-img$(EXESUF): qemu-img.o ..snip.. libqemuutil.a
+
+On Windows, all binaries have the suffix '.exe', so all Makefile rules
+which create binaries must include the $(EXESUF) variable on the binary
+name. e.g.
+
+   qemu-img$(EXESUF): qemu-img.o ..snip..
+
+This expands to '.exe' on Windows, or '' on other platforms.
+
+Variable naming
+---------------
 
 The QEMU convention is to define variables to list different groups of
-object files. These are named with the convention $PREFIX-obj-y. For
-example the libqemuutil.a file will be linked with all objects listed
-in a variable 'util-obj-y'. So, for example, util/Makefile.obj will
-contain a set of definitions looking like
+object files. These are named with the convention $PREFIX-obj-y.  The
+Meson "chardev" variable in the previous example corresponds to a
+variable 'chardev-obj-y'.
 
-  util-obj-y += bitmap.o bitops.o hbitmap.o
-  util-obj-y += fifo8.o
-  util-obj-y += acl.o
-  util-obj-y += error.o qemu-error.o
+Likewise, tests that are executed by "make check-unit" are grouped into
+a variable check-unit-y, like this:
 
-When there is an object file which needs to be conditionally built based
+  check-unit-y += tests/test-visitor-serialization$(EXESUF)
+  check-unit-y += tests/test-iov$(EXESUF)
+  check-unit-y += tests/test-bitmap$(EXESUF)
+
+When a test or object file which needs to be conditionally built based
 on some characteristic of the host system, the configure script will
 define a variable for the conditional. For example, on Windows it will
 define $(CONFIG_POSIX) with a value of 'n' and $(CONFIG_WIN32) with a
 value of 'y'. It is now possible to use the config variables when
 listing object files. For example,
 
-  util-obj-$(CONFIG_WIN32) += oslib-win32.o qemu-thread-win32.o
-  util-obj-$(CONFIG_POSIX) += oslib-posix.o qemu-thread-posix.o
+  check-unit-$(CONFIG_POSIX) += tests/test-vmstate$(EXESUF)
 
 On Windows this expands to
 
-  util-obj-y += oslib-win32.o qemu-thread-win32.o
-  util-obj-n += oslib-posix.o qemu-thread-posix.o
+  check-unit-n += tests/vmstate.exe
 
-Since libqemutil.a links in $(util-obj-y), the POSIX specific files
-listed against $(util-obj-n) are ignored on the Windows platform builds.
+Since the "check-unit" target only runs tests included in "$(check-unit-y)",
+POSIX specific tests listed in $(util-obj-n) are ignored on the Windows
+platform builds.

 In addition to these variables, it is possible to provide cflags and
 libs against individual source code files, by defining variables of the
-form $FILENAME-cflags and $FILENAME-libs. For example, the curl block
-driver needs to link to the libcurl library, so block/Makefile defines
-some variables:
+form $FILENAME-cflags and $FILENAME-libs. For example, the test
+test-crypto-tlscredsx509 needs to link to the libtasn1 library,

+  tests/crypto-tls-x509-helpers.o-libs := $(TASN1_LIBS)
 
 The scope is a little different between the two variables. The libs get
 used when linking any target binary that includes the curl.o object
 file, while the cflags get used when compiling the curl.c file only.

-
-Since the source code is spread across multiple directories, the rules
-for each file are similarly modularized. Thus each subdirectory
-containing .c files will usually also contain a Makefile.objs file.
-These files are not directly invoked by a recursive make, but instead
-they are imported by the top level Makefile and/or Makefile.target
-
-Each Makefile.objs usually just declares a set of variables listing the
-.o files that need building from the source files in the directory. They
-will also define any custom linker or compiler flags. For example in
-block/Makefile.objs

-- Makefile.target
-
-This file provides the entry point used to build each individual system
-or userspace emulator target. Each enabled target has its own
-subdirectory. For example if configure is run with the argument
-'--target-list=x86_64-softmmu', then a sub-directory 'x86_64-softmmu'
-will be created, containing a 'Makefile' which symlinks back to
-Makefile.target
-
-So when the recursive '$(MAKE) -C x86_64-softmmu' is invoked, it ends up
-using Makefile.target for the build rules.
