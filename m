I don't have a better idea yet, but just want to say that accidentally
I was trying to look into this as well starting from this week and I'd
say that's mostly what I thought about too (I was still reading a bit
seabios when I saw this email)... so at least this idea makes sense to
me.

Would the guest OS still change the PCI bus number even after the
firmware (BIOS/UEFI)?  Could I ask in what case would that happen?

Thanks,
