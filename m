That's correct, it requires patch 3 as well to prevent that. Without patch 3, 
if a (i.e. bad) client sends a 'count' parameter >> msize then the Treaddir 
request is processed by server to full extent according to 'count' and finally 
aborted by a transport error since server's response would exceed msize.

Yep.

Sorry for that. :) I thought I made it clear with the directory entries 
example. I try to be more clear next time.

Patience please. I have to limit the scope of this patch series somewhere. I 
am aware about these issues, but if I add fixes for more and more edge cases 
(which already exist) as part of this patch series, it will become a never 
ending story.

I just added those particular fixes to this series, because they were directly 
related to things I've changed here for the actual purpose of this patch set, 
which was and is: readdir latency optimization.

Right, but you realized that a min. msize of 4096 (in combination with
patch 3) prevents the readdir data loss issue we discussed here (provided we 
have a "good" client sending count=msize-11), right?

If so, I suggest I "try" to address your concerns you came up with here in the 
commit log message as far as I can, and would like to ask you to adjust the 
message later on according to your personal preference if required.
