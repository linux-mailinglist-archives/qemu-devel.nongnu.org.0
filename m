Good suggestion.

>> +
>> +Input Validation
>> +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>> +Inputs from the guest or external sources (e.g. network, files) cannot be
>> +trusted and may be invalid.  Inputs must be checked before using them in a way
>> +that could crash the program, expose host memory to the guest, or otherwise be
>> +exploitable by an attacker.
>> +
>> +The most sensitive attack surface is device emulation.  All hardware register
>> +accesses and data read from guest memory must be validated.  A typical example

>> +
>> +  typedef struct {
>> +      ProcessingUnit unit[2];
>> +      ...
>> +  } MyDeviceState;
>> +
>> +  static void mydev_writel(void *opaque, uint32_t addr, uint32_t val)
>> +  {
>> +      MyDeviceState *mydev = opaque;
>> +      ProcessingUnit *unit;
>> +
>> +      switch (addr) {
>> +      case MYDEV_SELECT_UNIT:
>> +          unit = &mydev->unit[val];   <-- this input wasn't validated!
>> +          ...
>> +      }
>> +  }
>> +
>> +If ``val`` is not in range [0, 1] then an out-of-bounds memory access will take
>> +place when ``unit`` is dereferenced.  The code must check that ``val`` is 0 or
>> +1 and handle the case where it is invalid.
>> +
>> +Unexpected Device Accesses
>> +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>> +The guest may access device registers in unusual orders or at unexpected
>> +moments.  Device emulation code must not assume that the guest follows the
>> +typical "theory of operation" presented in driver writer manuals.  The guest
>> +may make nonsense accesses to device registers such as starting operations
