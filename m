The error I got was specifically "Failed to lock byte 100" and VM not 
starting.  The ISO file was on a R/W NFS3 share, but was itself R/O for 
the user that root was mapped to by linux-nfs-server via /etc/exports
options, specifically the file iso file was mode 0444 in a 0755 
directory, and the exports line was (simplified)

/share1 
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/64(ro,sync,mp,subtree_check,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000)

where xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/64 is the numeric IPv6 prefix of the LAN

NFS kernel Server ran Debian Stretch kernel 4.19.0-0.bpo.8-amd64 #1 SMP 
Debian 4.19.98-1~bpo9+1 (2020-03-09) x86_64 GNU/Linux

NFS client mount options were:

rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,
soft,proto=tcp6,timeo=600,retrans=6,sec=sys,mountaddr=xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxff:fexx:xxxx,
mountvers=3,mountport=45327,mountproto=udp6,local_lock=none,addr=xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxff:fexx:xxxx

NFS client ran Debian Buster kernel 4.19.0-0.bpo.6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian
4.19.67-2+deb10u2~bpo9+1 (2019-11-12) x86_64 with Debian qemu-system-
x86 version 1:5.0-14~bpo10+1  Booting used SysV init and libvirt
was not used.

Copying the ISO to a local drive (where qemu-as-root had full 
capabilities to bypass file security) worked around the failure.

I hope these details help reproduce the bug.

And I still have no idea why qemu tried to lock bytes in a read-only raw
image file, there is no block metadata to synchronize access to (like in
qcow2), when the option explicitly said ",format=raw" to avoid attempts
to access the iso file as any of the advanced virtual disk formats.
