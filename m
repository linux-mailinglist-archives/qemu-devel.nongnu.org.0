Hi,

For what this series does, see the cover letter of v1 (linked above).


In v3 I=E2=80=99ve addressed Vladimir=E2=80=99s further comments:
- Patch 9: Skip the loop if c =3D=3D NULL (and also renamed @i to @child_i)

- Patch 10: Drop local_err, check bdrv_child_refresh_perm()=E2=80=99s retur=
n
            value instead

- Patch 11: Amended commit message and comment

- Patch 12: Extended to cover the =E2=80=9Cnew=E2=80=9D compress filter dri=
ver

- Patch 15: Dropped; considering qemu never actually creates loops,
            there is never an unsafe configuration.  Sometimes the user
            may not get what they want, but then maybe this was actually
            what they wanted.  I think the discussion I had with
            Vladimir shows that this issue isn=E2=80=99t as clear-cut as I
            thought, so let=E2=80=99s wait with a =E2=80=9Cfix=E2=80=9D unt=
il someone actually
            has a problem with the current behavior.

- Patch 17: Dropped; was superseded by a patch from Thomas.

- Patch 16 (was 18):
  - Moved doc string under def
  - Pointed out that @expected_node may be None, but this only means
    that the leaf must not exist.
  - Contracted asserts
  - %s/path_node/child_name/
  - Kept the prefix /, because, well, why not
  - Kept % for formatting, because I don=E2=80=99t see the advantage of
    .format() =E2=80=93 I would have liked to use f strings, but those were=
 only
    introduced in 3.6, and our minimum version is 3.5.

- Patch 17: Added

- Patch 18 (was 19): Dropped removal of self.vm.shutdown(), because
                     that=E2=80=99s done by patch 17 now

- Patch 20 (was 21): Moved doc strings under defs (kept R-b, because
                     that seemed right to do)

- Patch 21 (was 22): Moved doc string under def

- Patch 23: Dropped, because it only tested things changed by the old
            patch 17 (which I dropped, too)
