Hey Klaus,

Sorry for the late reply!  I finally found this message amid the pile of 
emails Qemu dumped on me.

I don't know what the right answer is here... NVMe is designed in a way 
where you *do* "carve up" the flash into logical groupings and the nvme 
firmware decides on how that's done. Those logical groupings can be 
attached to different controllers(which we don't have here yet?) after 
init, but that's a problem for future us I guess?But that's all stuff 
you already know.

The "nvme-nvm" solution might be the right approach, but I'm a bit 
hesitant on the idea of growing tnvmcap...

I can't think of any way to create namespaces on the fly and not have it 
use some single existing block backend, unless we defined a range of 
block images on qemu start and namespace create/attach only uses one 
image up to and including it's max size per namespace? That might work, 
and I think that's what you suggested (or at least is similar to), 
though it could be pretty wasteful. It wouldn't offer a "true" namespace 
management support, but could be close enough.

I'm in the middle of going through the patch you posted. Nice job!  I'm 
glad to see more people adding enhancements. It was pretty stale for years.
