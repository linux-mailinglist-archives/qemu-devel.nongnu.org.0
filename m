Correct, and ne2k_pci is known to already fail on architectures where the
IO address range starts at 0, such as riscv. Not that it helps to fix the
code - doing so only results in a crash elsewhere when running a riscv
emulation (when executing outsl, suggesting that there may be a problem
with that emulation or its use). But that is a different problem.

I am far out of my league here, but what is the purpose of the !start
check given the PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM define which can also be 0 ? Shouldn't
the check be against PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM and PCIBIOS_MIN_IO ?

But, anyway, the above change fixes the problem for 'tulip', though
obviously not for 'ne2k_pci'. 'ne2k_pci' starts working if I remove
the "!ioaddr" check in ne2k_pci_init_one().

Thanks,
Guenter
