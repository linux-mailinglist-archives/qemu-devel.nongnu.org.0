Sorry about that! I posted this as RFC, and the reason it is mostly done =
as opposed to typical RFC which might not
even contain any code was that for most of the time I was sure that API o=
f this is straightforward and won't need
any significant discussion, and in the last minute after I discussed with=
 Kevin on IRC one=20
obscure case of block backend permissions that was failing, he told me ab=
out the amend interface.
Next time I guess, when new a API is involved, I will post an API RFC fir=
st always and then start the implementation.

I fixed both issues that iotests uncovered locally, now all luks and most=
 qcow2 tests pass=20
(118 and 194 sometimes fail with qcow2, and this happens regardless of my=
 patches, and same for 162 which seems to fail
always now, also regardless of my patches.
I have a git head after the merge window opened so probably some bugs wer=
e added, and maybe already fixed)


The first issue was in 'qcrypto-luks: implement the encryption key manage=
ment'
where I accidentally stored the name of the secret without strdup'ing in =
the create flow, so I got double free,
which indeed caused the heap corruptions you have seen.

Basically this line:
    luks->secret =3D options->u.luks.key_secret;

The second issue as you mention is indeed the change in filters I did. Do=
 you agree with that change btw?
If you ask me, I would even change the filter further and filter all the =
image options from the qemu command line since these are test inputs anyw=
ay.
This allowed me to have the same test for both luks and qcow2 luks encryp=
ted test.

Also I didn't even expect you to run the iotests for me, but
rather just wanted a general RFC level feedback on the whole thing, that =
is why I even mentioned that I didn't run them.
So sorry for the trouble I caused!

I btw don't agree with you that only maintainers need to run all the iote=
sts fully.=20
I think that the patch submitter  should run all the tests that he can to=
 catch as many problems as he can,
_unless_ of course this is an RFC.


Best regards,
Thanks for the review,
Sorry again for the trouble,

Maxim Levitsky
