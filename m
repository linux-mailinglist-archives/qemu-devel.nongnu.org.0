I would prefer not to have "sifive-fe310-g000" and "sifive-fe310-g002"
boards as that seems like it might lead to way too many boards in the
future.

In saying that board properties aren't that much better if there are
lots of boards as well.

One option would be something like what the ARM virt board does. Where
"sifive_e" is always the latest and you can specify different
versions. We would then have some deprecation scheme to remove older
boards.

I think for now properties seem to work, we can have revB=3Dtrue to
change anything required to match revB and the default is revA (or
whatever they call it).

If a revC comes out it should be easy to handle that via a property.
In the future we can re-evaluate what to do if that gets too hard to
maintain. Eventually we probably want the default to be the revB, but
that will break users so let's try to avoid that for now.

It's also possible that a revC won't break compatibility. For example
if revC just adds a new device, we can just expose that for all revs.
