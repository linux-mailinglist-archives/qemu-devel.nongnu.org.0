Public bug reported:

On a server, I have a Windows 10 VM with Qemu 4.1.0 (latest) from https://q=
emu.weilnetz.de/w64/ installed.
There I have a Mac OS 9.2.2 machine.
Now if I connect to the Windows VM with VNC or RDP or even VMWare console, =
the Mouse in the Mac OS Guest inside Qemu is waaaay to fast. Even when lowe=
ring the mouse speed in the Mac OS mouse setting, one pixel in the Host (Wi=
ndows 10 VM) still moves the mouse by 10 pixels inside the Qemu machine.
I tried different resolutions but that does not help.
Is there any way to fix this or any way how I can provide more information?
Thanks
