I think there is a more general problem here actually. bdrv_open() is a
blocking operation and it shouldn't be. BlockDriver should probably have
a .bdrv_co_open instead, and I think this wouldn't be too hard to do.

However, that's only half of the solution: QMP still takes the BQL while
it's executing a command, so even if we used a coroutine, it would be of
no use if then the QMP command implementation would just call
BDRV_POLL_WHILE() to wait for the completion of the coroutine while
holding the BQL.

This is going in direction of async commands that Marc-Andr=E9 was working
on. I didn't follow this closely, so I'm not sure what the status there
is, but he and Markus should be able to tell more.

The whole point of -blockdev is that it's a direct mapping of
blockdev-add to the command line, so making things behave differently
between them sounds like a bad idea.
