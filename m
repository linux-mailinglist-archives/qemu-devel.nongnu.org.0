Unless the TCG opcodes in tcg/tci/tcg-target.c.inc are used in real-live =

scenarios, they are dead code, too.

Writing a test case which produces them directly (not for some real=20
architecture) is not a real-live scenario.

And the remaining TODO assertions are a good indicator that the current=20
tests are incomplete for native TCG because they obviously don't cover=20
all TCG opcodes.
