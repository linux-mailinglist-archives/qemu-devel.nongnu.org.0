I vote for addition of a change similar to what Philippe described.

Furthermore, it looks to me the correct way would be to now do full
deprecation of --enable-bluez and --disable-bluez. This means adding
this to documentation (not related to bluetooth devices support), not
only a change in "configure". This also means that only after two next
full cycles these options could be removed.

True, this could have been done together with bluetooth devices
support deprecation (and in that case we could have deleted these
options right away), but it wasn't. Users don't have a crystal ball to
know that we assumed that --enable-bluez and --disable-bluez were part
of bluetooth devices support, and could rightfully complain about an
abrupt elimination of a compile time option.

This is my understanding, at least.

What do you think?

Aleksandar
