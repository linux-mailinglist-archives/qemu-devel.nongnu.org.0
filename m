I disagree, a "normal" lifecycle is a single connection & instance per devi=
ce.

Having the backend handle multiple connections is needlessly more
complicated. You need to correctly handle multiple states, flushed
anything private between connections etc. It should be optional.

It is simpler to ensure it is reset correctly.

The management layer should be involved if any side crashes or restart anyw=

Ah ok,  I think we can guard it with a capability too.

Sure, the goal of the spec is to have basic interoperability between
implementations, not to follow whatever libvhost-user is currently
doing.

I don't know why having the backend handle multiple connections would
help with that.

Having undefined behaviour for things that should not happen in normal
circumstances seems acceptable. Having QEMU (or the /master/) restart
is currently undefined, because it's not considered a simple/normal
situation: the vhost-user spec doesn't say much about it, does it?

I'd prefer to keep things simple and have 1-1 device-backend instance
relationship by default.
