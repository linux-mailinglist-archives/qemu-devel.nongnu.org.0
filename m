Right, we don't add VMX by default to any CPU models (even if
they are separate versions).

I think I see the issue, now: adding vmx-* to a new CPU version
will trigger the feature dependency warnings because VMX is
disabled by default.  This is a bug we must fix.  It should be
enough to simply clear env->user_features[] at the end of
x86_cpu_load_model().
