Fair enough.  I'll send a patch to change the script behavior.

I saw that, and I was very disappointed... I double checked the
machines, the runners status, tag names and they all seem to be OK.

So, I think the reason for the skip (there's an open issue on GitLab
itself about not communicating to users the reason) is that GitLab
does a late evaluation of the job condition.  For those jobs the
condition is:

   rules:
   - if: '$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME =3D=3D "staging"'

Which by the time the job was evaluated it was no longer true (there
was new content on the staging branch).  There are multiple ways to
solve the problem, including (and in my order of preference):

 1. using '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH' instead of '$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME', given
    that the pushed branch name should be kept stable even if the content
    (thus reference name) changes

 2. not changing anything if you believe that under normal
    circunstances one pipeline for the staging will be running at a
    time.

I'll prepare a new version with #1, unless you have a strong feeling
against it.

- Cleber.
