My problem with this patch isn't actually the docstrings -- it's 
one-line comments.

If you can teach flake8 to allow this:

# Pretend this is a single-line comment that's 73 chars

but disallow this:

# Pretend this is a two-line comment that's 73 chars,
# and continues to a new line that's also pretty long,
# and maybe keeps going, too.

I will happily accept that patch. Without the ability to enforce the 
style though, I am reluctant to pretend that it's even a preference that 
we have. I think it's a waste to hunt down and re-flow single-line 
comments that just barely squeak over a limit. They look worse.

We can discuss this more when we go to propose a style guide for the 
Python folder; I think it's maybe a misprioritization of our energies in 
the present context.

(I still have the style guide on my TODO list, and even began writing a 
draft at one point, but I think we'd both like to press forward on the 
Typing bits first.)
