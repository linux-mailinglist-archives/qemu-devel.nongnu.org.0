I can confirm that this behaviour is still present on kde 5.20.4.

You can run e.g. khelpcenter and observe:

kf.service.services: The desktop entry file "/usr/share/applications/qemu.d=
esktop" has Type=3D "Application" but no Exec line
kf.service.sycoca: Invalid Service :  "/usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop"

Title:
  /usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop should have an "Exec=3D" key.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  According to the www.freedesktop.org .desktop-file specification, all
  "Application" desktop files should have an "Exec=3D" key. The one in
  qemu doesn't.

  This can be easily verified by running kbuildsycoca4 if KDE4 is
  present, but the issue is not DE-dependent.

  Which binary exactly should be assigned as the default one, I don't
  know.
