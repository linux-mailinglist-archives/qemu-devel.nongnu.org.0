This, and several similar ones that you also posted.

Maybe you could add a new int target_to_host_bitmask_strict(int src,=20
translate_tbl, int *dst), which returns 0 when *dst is bit-for-bit=20
translated from src, and returns -1 if src had bits not specified by=20
translate_tbl.  In that case, the caller can then translate all usual=20
bits and rely on the syscall() failure (as you tried here), but you can=20
also flag -TARGET_EINVAL up front for bits not covered by the table.

Indeed.  Good catch.
