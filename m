Here is the first patch for which it failed for me:

Message-ID: <20200123124357.124019-1-felipe@nutanix.com>

The problem seems to be related to line endings because the patch that
git-apply sees eventually has "\r\n" whereas the file to be patched has
only "\n".

If I understand correctly (this is a bit of guesswork after reading man
pages and trying out a few options), git-mailsplit would normally get
rid of the "\r". However, this specific patch email is base64 encoded,
so the encoded "\r" characters survive this stage.

git-mailinfo later decodes the email, but doesn't seem to do anything
about "\r" again, so it survives this one as well. This means feeding a
patch with the wrong line endings to git-apply, which just fails.

Any suggestion how to fix this? (For this patch, I just enabled
pipe_decode again, so no Message-Id tag for it.)

Kevin
