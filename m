As you are now using a half-open range, should this be:
  (0 <= X < Y <= 32)

> +#define QCOW_OFLAG_SUB_ALLOC_RANGE(X, Y) \
> +    (QCOW_OFLAG_SUB_ALLOC(Y) - QCOW_OFLAG_SUB_ALLOC(X))

with <= instead of <, then it is impossible to distinguish between 
QCOW_OFLAG_SUB_ALLOC_RANGE(0,0) and QCOW_OFLAG_SUB_ALLOC_RANGE(31,31) 
which both resolve to 0.  I guess it depends on whether the later uses 
of this macro require a non-zero mask ('X < Y') or tolerate the corner 
case of no subclusters selected ('X <= Y').

Fixing the comment (if necessary) does not change the code, and the rest 
of this patch is fine, so:
