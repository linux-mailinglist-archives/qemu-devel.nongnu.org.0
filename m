I want to reconsider the above solution.  The pagecache_get_page solution below has problems 
which I will elaborate on shortly.

I was confused about the granularity of vfio_iommu sharing, but now I see that each vGPU 
in the gvt example would have its own vfio_iommu, so one misbehaving process would not 
block another.  Multiple iommu groups within one container share a vfio_iommu, and a
delay in finishing the remap will block all those devices from completing pin or 
rw operations, but that only blocks the kernel thread servicing that application.  
Please say more on how that could cause the system to become unusable.

I prototyped this using pagecache_get_page() to fault in and translate any page in the segment,
and it works. However, faulting at this level misses many checks and side effects that are
normally applied at the handle_mm_fault() level and below.  Just as one example, shmem_fault 
has accounting and limits for its swap-backed ramfs.  There is no good way to refactor the 
higher level functions to apply all side effects and only use a segment offset rather than VA.
Those functions use VA, vma, and pagetable throughout.

To salvage this approach, we could pre-fault and pin the entire dma range on the unmap-remap
call, and unpin in map-remap. If we do so,  pagecache_get_page() will simply return the 
translation. However, the pinning is very expensive and could cause a noticeable 
pause for guest operations if it waits on any pin or rw operations during the pre-fault phase.
We could pin unconditionally in the initial dma_map, before the guest is started, but
that defeats the purpose of the vfio_pin_pages interface.
