I think "rigorous" is to be read as ambition, not description.  Sadly,
QOM stagnated before getting close to realizing its ambitions.

If the off-by-one you found is "four forms" followed by a list of three,
then the error isn't "four", it's the omitted fourth list item.

Anyway, I grant you "nada" was an exaggeration for effect.

Note that the doc comments are reference documentation.  QAPI got that,
too.  Reference documentation is useful, but no replacement for an
explainer like qapi-code-gen.txt.

You're right.

Specifically, three of four kinds of type names are documented:
primitive, child, scalar.  The fourth kind is not, and it can be
anything.  It need not be a QAPI type name.  In any case, you just have
to know what the type name means.

In contrast, QAPI introspection defines all types in terms of type
constructors and primitive types.  It completely hides user-defined QAPI
type names, so they don't become ABI.

Do you think we could somehow appropriate QAPI's type system for QOM
introspection?
