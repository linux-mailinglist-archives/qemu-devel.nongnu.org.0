I think you'll have to break out a debugger on it to see why it's
exiting; if you can break on any exit paths and get a backtrace we can
have some more guesswork.

Title:
  qemu on windows host exits after savevm command

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm running qemu-system-i386.exe 3.1.0 with this command line:
  "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe"  -L C:\user\qemu\pc-bios\ -n=
ame win7 -m 4G -uuid 564db62e-e031-b5cf-5f34-a75f8cefa98e -rtc base=3Dlocal=
time -accel hax -hdd C:\VirtualMachines\Dev\Win10x64_VS17\swap.qcow "C:\Vir=
tualMachines\qemu\qemu_win7.qcow"
  Host OS Windows 10 x64, guest OS Wondows 7 x86.

  Wait till the OS loads, go to compat_monitor0 tab and enter command:
  savevm loaded_win
  After a few seconds qemu exits, running it another time and entering comm=
and:
  info snapshots
  says "There is no snapshot available". I've tried rinning it with -accel =
tcg, with same results. I've tried less memory (1G), same results.
