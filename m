I just noticed a breakage with 'make check-unit' when running on an
s390x host (on my laptop, it runs fine; haven't tried other
architectures). This happens with current master, but I managed to
track the original breakage down to

commit ff3dc8fefe953fd3650279e064bf63b212c5699a

    filemon: ensure watch IDs are unique to QFileMonitor scope
   =20
    The watch IDs are mistakenly only unique within the scope of the
    directory being monitored. This is not useful for clients which are
    monitoring multiple directories. They require watch IDs to be unique
    globally within the QFileMonitor scope.

On that commit, make check-unit fails with

  TEST    check-unit: tests/test-util-filemonitor
Expected watch id 4 but got 0
**

(I usually run as root on that box and as a normal user on my laptop;
not sure if that makes a difference.)

On master, the failure looks a bit different, but it's probably the
same issue:

  TEST    check-unit: tests/test-util-filemonitor
Expected watch id 200000000 but got 100000000

Fedora 29, QEMU built with '/root/git/qemu/build/../configure'

I can try to collect extra info if you tell me what would be helpful.
