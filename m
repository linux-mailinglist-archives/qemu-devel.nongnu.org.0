I find it related.

I don't think what follow is the answer to "What do you expect with all
your critics?".

QEMU makes a difference between hardware (peripherals) and architecture
(mostly ISA).

peripheral hardware is stored in hw/, while ISA in target/.

The SH4 architecture is stored in target/sh4/. The RX architecture is
stored in target/rx/.

Renesas produces chips implementing SH4 or RX.

It is common for a chip producer to reuse peripherals between
components. Renesas reused its UART & timers in its new RX-based
microcontroller series.

From a maintainer point of view, it makes sense to maintain similar
peripherals altogether.

Actually Yoshinori demostrated it, in his latest series:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg708102.html
Yoshinori Sato (10):
  hw/intc: RX62N interrupt controller (ICUa)
  hw/timer: Renesas 8bit timer module.
  hw/timer: Renesas TMU/CMT module.
  hw/char: Renesas SCI module.
  hw/rx: RX MCU and target
  Add rx-softmmu
  hw/sh4: Convert renesas_sci.
  hw/char: remove sh_serial.c
  hw/sh4: Convert to renesas_timer.c
  hw/timer: remove sh_timer.c

In this series the SH4 and RX based machines reuse the same Renesas
peripherals.

I never intended to dictate anything, and I apologize if it sounds like
I did. I'm using my hobbyist free time to help others get their code
integrated into the mainstream QEMU.
I think we all try to do our best. Some contributors joined the project
recently and send big series. If a contributor has more experience,
he/she can suggest changes so the contribution is more likely to be
merged. The project is big and with various APIs, it is hard to see
what side-effect can have a single change that appears isolated on
a remote subsystem.

I spend a lot of my personal time trying to improve Yoshinori work
so while it would be useful for him, it would also help other users.

It took me time because adding a new target/machine involves a lot of
code. But at the end I delivered something, I did not abandon
Yoshinori and his work.

Yoshinori, since you have obvious knowledge of the Renesas hardware,
and you might have access to it, do you agree to be listed as its
maintainer?

Aurelien, is that still OK with you?

Thanks,

Phil.
