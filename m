Yes KVM kernel side should not be involed when we're using split
irqchip in this case.  However it should still belongs to the work of
the userspace KVM module (kvm-all.c) so that it can still "mimic" the
resamplefd feature that KVM_IRQFD provides.

It's my fault to be unclear on using "KVM" above.  I should really say
it as kvm-all.c, say, the QEMU layer for the kernel KVM module.

Indeed this problem is complicated... let me try to summarize.

Firstly KVM split irqchip and resamplefd is not really going to work
in the kernel (I think we just overlooked that when introducing the
2nd feature, no matter which one comes first), because the resample
operation should be part of IOAPIC EOI, nevertheless when using split
irqchip IOAPIC is in userspace.

After we noticed this, Alex somewhere proposed to disable that in KVM,
which is actually the 1st kernel patch (654f1f13ea56).

We should (at the same time) propose patch 1 too in this series but I
guess everybody just forgot this afterwards (Paolo actually proposed
mostly the whole solution but I guess it got forgotten too)...

About the fast path speedup: the main logic should be to mimic the
same resamplefd feature as provided by KVM_IRQFD but this time only in
the userspace.  However now we're implementing the same logic only
within userspace kvm-all.c, and the kernel KVM should be totally not
aware of this.  Doing that benefits us in that the KVM interface in
QEMU does not need to be changed (majorly kvm_irqchip_assign_irqfd()).
What we need to do is just to wire up the userspace IOAPIC with these
resamplefds.  And the idea is actually the same too - someone (VFIO)
wants to have one fd (which is the resamplefd) kicked when EOI comes
when requesting for a KVM irqfd, no matter who's going to kick it
(kernel KVM or userspace).  That's all.

It should not.
