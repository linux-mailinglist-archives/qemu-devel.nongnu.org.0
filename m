Could also add a sentence like "This may change in the future".

It does not.  It's questionable style, though.  Easy enough to tidy up.

Oh, I missed that one.  It's the QMP equivalent to "info snapshots", and
it is required to finish the job.  Since we're at v5, I'd be okay with a
follow-up patch, as long as it is done for 5.2.

With the doc comment nits addressed, and with new command
query-snapshots either included or promised for later in 5.2:
