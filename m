My number one constraint here is that QEMU remains a useful tool.  I'd love to 
support every version of every extension ever published (along with allowing 
for control of all the optional features), but there are just more important 
things to do so that's not going to happen.  That said, I also want to make 
sure that there is some stability in QEMU -- specifically because having a 
RISC-V implementation that supports multiple targets is very useful.  I started 
hacking on QEMU because I wanted to test my other software and it's just too 
cumbersome to keep around a pile of RISC-V implementations to test everything 
against.

In terms of which drafts we keep, I think it's best to just play this by ear -- 
for example, I'd be in favor of keeping draft extensions around if they end up 
widely implemented, and doubly so if they're similar to the ratified extension.  
The CLIC would be a good candidate for this: it's in all sorts of hardware, but 
the actual ratified spec may be a bit different than the drafts.  In that case 
I'd be in favor of keeping around the draft specs for a long time, as they're 
probably going to be pretty easy to support.
