I haven't seen any similar reports nor any updates here.
Might I ask if you  have got any further since then?

Qemu 5.0 is available in Ubuntu 20.10 now, if you are willing to upgrade or=
 install a test system that might be worth a try (new libvirt is still WIP,=
 but unlikely to play a role here).
20.10 proposed would even have a 5.8.0.12.14 kernel since a kernel change m=
ight have been what started this that might be worth a check as well.

Title:
  KVM Win 10 guest pauses after kernel upgrade

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hello!
  Unfortunately the bug has apparently reappeared. I have a Windows 10 runn=
ing in a VM, which after my today's "apt upgrade" goes into pause mode afte=
r a few seconds of running time.

  Until yesterday it used to work and I was able to boot the VM. During
  the kernel update (from 5.4.0-28.33 to 5.4.0-29.34) the VM was active
  and then went into pause mode. Even after a reboot of my host system
  the problem still persists: the VM boots for a few seconds and then
  switches to pause mode.

  Current Kernel: Linux andreas-laptop 5.4.0-29-generic #33-Ubuntu SMP
  Wed Apr 29 14:32:27 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

  Maybe relevant logfile lines:
