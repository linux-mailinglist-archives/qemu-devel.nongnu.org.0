From: Stefan Hajnoczi <stefanha@redhat.com>

The "Multiple queue support" section makes references to vhost-user-net
"queue pairs".  This is confusing for two reasons:
1. This actually applies to all device types, not just vhost-user-net.
2. VHOST_USER_GET_QUEUE_NUM returns the number of virtqueues, not the
   number of queue pairs.

Reword the section so that the vhost-user-net specific part is relegated
to the very end: we acknowledge that vhost-user-net historically
automatically enabled the first queue pair.
