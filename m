I think that docs which are "done" should go into the git repo. If they
are rather still work-in-progress and change very often, or relate to a
feature that has not been merged yet, the wiki is likely the better place.

As long as the focus is still on QEMU, I think it is fine. If the
information is only about libvirt or the kernel, that documentation
should maybe rather be added to libvirt.org or linux-kvm.org instead.

The lines were too long - Firefox displayed this example with a
horizontal scrollbar, even if I resized the browser window large enough.
With my change, it shows up nicely without scrollbar.
