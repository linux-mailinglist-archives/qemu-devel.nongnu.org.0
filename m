I think they can reasonably continue to live in tools/
even once we've got more stuff in system/.

Yes, I'm definitely working on a "we can reshuffle stuff
later, but let's get the basic conversion done first" basis.

The mechanics for handling .hx files are already in the tree;
I can either help or work on the bit of qemu.1 that uses those.

Kashyap has volunteered to do qemu-cpu-models.texi.
I have patches on-list that try to do the QAPI doc-comments.

I think the next thing after this is to take chunks of documentation
that are currently used in qemu-doc.html but not put into the
qemu.1 manpage (ie which aren't in the 'man begin'/'man end'
sections), and convert those into individual .rst files
to go into docs/system:

 * docs/security.texi
 * qemu-tech.texi
 * qemu-deprecated.texi
 * various bits of qemu-doc.texi that don't go in the
   manpage and that are coherent chunks of documentation,
   eg "Supported build platforms", the various "$ARCH System emulator"
   sections

That will whittle qemu-doc.texi down to more or less just
the contents of the manpage. Then we can convert that
part to rST.

I note that softfreeze is now 1 month away -- we should
decide whether we think we can get this basically all
done by then, or whether there's a good "pause point"
we'd like to use where, say, most of qemu-doc.texi
remains as it is, or where it retains just the
content that goes into the qemu.1 manpage.

thanks
