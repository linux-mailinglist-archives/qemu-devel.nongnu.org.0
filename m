[A quick question ... while I'm still testing]

I just applied your v4, and I'm here:

    $> git describe
    v4.2.0-2399-g3cba0d19f2


Expected warning on 'create' wiht no -F:

    $> ~/build/v4_tightened_qemu-img-QEMU/qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./bas=
e.raw ./overlay1.qcow2
    qemu-img: warning: Deprecated use of backing file without explicit back=
ing format (detected format of raw)
    Formatting './overlay1.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D4294967296 backing_fi=
le=3D./base.raw backing_fmt=3Draw cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff=
 refcount_bits=3D16

But here is the lack of warning with 'convert' expected?

    $> ~/build/v4_tightened_qemu-img-QEMU/qemu-img convert -B ./base.raw -O=
 qcow2 overlay1.qcow2 flattened.qcow2

In your response on the v3, you said the above should throw a warning;
refer to Message-ID: <2fd580c2-4b94-4430-1072-ef04bbd2da60@redhat.com>

For completeness' sake:

    $> ~/build/v4_tightened_qemu-img-QEMU/qemu-img info --backing-chain fla=
ttened.qcow2
    image: flattened.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 4 GiB (4294967296 bytes)
    disk size: 196 KiB
    cluster_size: 65536
    backing file: ./base.raw
    Format specific information:
        compat: 1.1
        lazy refcounts: false
        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false
