I'm merely responding to demand.

Subject: Minutes of KVM Forum BoF on deprecating stuff
Message-ID: <87mur0ls8o.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>

* We need to communicate "you're using something that is deprecated".
  How?  Right now, we print a deprecation message.  Okay when humans use
  QEMU directly in a shell.  However, when QEMU sits at the bottom of a
  software stack, the message will likely end up in a log file that is
  effectively write-only.
 
  - The one way to get people read log files is crashing their
    application.  A command line option --future could make QEMU crash
    right after printing a deprecation message.  This could help with
    finding use of deprecated features in a testing environment.

  - A less destructive way to grab people's attention is to make things
    run really, really slow: have QEMU go to sleep for a while after
    printing a deprecation message.
    
  - We can also pass the buck to the next layer up: emit a QMP event.

    Sadly, by the time the next layer connects to QMP, plenty of stuff
    already happened.  We'd have to buffer deprecation events somehow.

    What would libvirt do with such an event?  Log it, taint the domain,
    emit a (libvirt) event to pass it on to the next layer up.

  - A completely different idea is to have a configuratin linter.  To
    support doing this at the libvirt level, QEMU could expose "is
    deprecated" in interface introspection.  Feels feasible for QMP,
    where we already have sufficiently expressive introspection.  For
    CLI, we'd first have to provide that (but we want that anyway).

  - We might also want to dispay deprecation messages in QEMU's GUI
    somehow, or on serial consoles.

Second to last item.

QAPISchemaMember (and all of the QAPISchemaFOO) are not about generating
C code.

QAPISchema is the intermediate representation.  It uses the
QAPISchemaFOO to represent schema entities.

QAPISchemaMember is what enum members and object members have in common.
For Enum members, the common stuff is all there is, and that's why
they're represented as QAPISchemaMember.  Object members are more
complex, and that's why they're represented as
QAPISchemaObjectTypeMember, subtype of QAPISchemaMember.

QAPISchema provides three services:

* Looking up schema identities by name (public methods .lookup_entity(),
  .lookup_type()).

* Semantic checker (public method .check()).  Delegates checking the
  parts to the QAPISchemaFOO.  QAPISchemaMember.check_clash() is part of
  this.

* Walking the IR (public method .visit()).  Delegates walking parts to
  the QAPISchemaFOO.  QAPISchemaMember has no code for this purpose,
  because it has no parts to walk.

QAPISchema is related to generating C only by .visit() getting used by
the code generating C.

Some QAPISchemaFOO are additionally related by providing it helpers such
as QAPISchemaType.c_type().  QAPISchemaMember provides no such helper.

So, QAPISchemaMember serves just two purposes:

* Represent an enum member or (the common part of) an object type member

  Method __init__().

* Check this enum member or (the common part of) this object type member

  All the other code.

  What is checked?  Naming rules and name clashes with sibling members.

  The simplest case is actually the one closest to features: rejecting
  duplicate enum members (as in
  tests/qapi-schema/enum-clash-member.json).  See use of
  QAPISchemaMember.check_clash() in QAPISchemaEnumType.check().

  By the way, that case is missing from your tests :)

Add the test case, and you'll likely want to use its .check_clash()
method :)

Yes, scripts/qapi/ is under-documented.  Technical debt.  We all try to
pay it back when we can, and avoid incurring more, but we don't always
succeed.

to_qlit()'s tuple case was added in commit d626b6c1ae7 to make it
generate #if.

    qapi-introspect: add preprocessor conditions to generated QLit
    
    This commit adds 'ifcond' conditions to top-level QLit objects.
    Future work will add them to object and enum type members, i.e. within
    QLit objects.
    
    Extend the QLit generator to_qlit() to accept (@obj, @cond) tuples in
    addition to just @obj.  The tuple causes the QLit generated for
    objects for @obj with #if/#endif conditions for @cond.

Simple, but ugly.  The tuple's second element was the if condition then.

Commit 8c643361eeb turned the tuple's second element into a dict with
keys 'if' and 'comment', for generating comments.  No other dict keys
occur.  Still simple, and still ugly.

Your patch adds other dict keys.  I'd prefer not to do that.

Your tacit criticism that code that's this ugly should at least explain
itself in comments is valid.

Since to_qlit() treats

    (obj, {'if': None})
    (obj, {})
    obj

the same, the following should work:

            obj['features'] = [(f['name'], {'if': f.get('if')})
                               for f in features]
