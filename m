Hm... This doesn't feel right. crypto can't assume that it's working on
a local file. It's working on some lower level BlockDriverState,
whatever that may be. Remember that you could pass all kind of URLs e.g.
for network protocols like NBD or gluster. You don't want to check
whether a local filename exists then.

In fact, I'm not sure if having a special case for an already existing
file is even worth it: By the time we fail, we'll already have truncated
the file, so the old data is lost anyway. Deleting that empty or
half-initialised file doesn't seem much worse than leaving a broken file
behind.
