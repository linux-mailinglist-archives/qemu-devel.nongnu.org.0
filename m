If we assume that a non-negligible number of fuzz bugs will be exploitable
by a malicious guest OS to break out into the host, then I think it is
likely undesirable to make them public immediately without at least a basic
human triage step to catch possibly serious security issues.

Still a large % are likely to be low impact / not urgent to deal with so
we want a low overhead way to handle the fuzz output, which doesn't create
a bottleneck on a small number of people.

Overall my feeling is that we want to be able to farm out triage to the
respective subsystem maintainers, who can then decide whether the bug
needs notifying to the security team, or can be made public immediately.

I think ideally we would be doing triage in QEMU's own bug tracker, so
we don't need to have maintainers create accounts on a 3rd party tracker
to see reports.

Is is practical to identify a primary affected source file from the fuzz
crash report with any level reliablility such that we could file a private
launchpad bug, automatically CC'ing a subsystem maintainer (and the security
team)  ?

Daniel
