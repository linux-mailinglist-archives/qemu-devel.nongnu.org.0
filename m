One foot in the block subsystem, the other foot in the migration
subsystem.  I'm not sure where this should go.  Kevin?

Having completion close to whatever it completes would be nice, I guess.

When in doubt, leave the savevm / delvm stuff alone.

Its first commit 0824d6fc67 "for hard core developpers only: a new user
mode linux project :-)" calls the executable "vl", and has

    void help(void)
    {
        printf("Virtual Linux version " QEMU_VERSION ", Copyright (c) 2003 =
Fabrice Bellard\n"
               "usage: vl [-h] bzImage initrd [kernel parameters...]\n"
               "\n"
    [...]
        exit(1);
    }

The executable was renamed soon after.  I guess the source file name has
made people wonder ever since.
