QMP is in the same boat: it needs to process input that isn't
necessarily full expressions (JSON-text in the RFC's grammar).

Any conventional parser can be made streaming by turning it into a
coroutine.  This is probably the simplest solution for handwritten
streaming LL parsers, because it permits recursive descent.  In Python,
I'd try a generator.

Our actual solution for QMP predates coroutine support in QEMU, and is
rather hamfisted:

* Streaming lexer: it gets fed characters one at a time, and when its
  state machine says "token complete", it feeds the token to the
  "streamer".

* "Streamer": gets fed tokens one at a time, buffers them up counting
  curly and square bracket nesting until the nesting is zero, then
  passes the buffered tokens to the parser.

* Non-streaming parser: it gets fed a sequence of tokens that constitute
  a full expression.

The best I can say about this is that it works.  The streamer's token
buffer eats a lot of memory compared to a real streaming parser, but in
practice, it's a drop in the bucket.

That plainly sucks.

Any parser must start with a proper grammar.  If it doesn't, it's a toy,
or a highway to madness.

Because qmp-shell is a half-hearted wrapper: we ran out of wrapping
paper, so JSON sticks out left and right.

Scrap and start over.

Parsing JSON is pretty simple.  Data point: QAPISchemaParser parses our
weird derivative of JSON in 239 SLOC.

While I recommend use of tools for parsing non-trivial grammars (you'll
screw up, they won't), they're massive overkill for JSON.

Scrap and start over.
