Agreed. Just to make sure we are all on the same page I am adding Wei

Agreed. It is just a matter of finding the right point to add a hook
so that if we abort the migration we can report DONE.

So this is only an issue for pages that are pushed out of the balloon
as a part of the shrinker process though. So fixing it would be pretty
straightforward as we would just have to initialize or at least dirty
pages that are leaked as a part of the shrinker. That may have an
impact on performance though as it would result in us dirtying pages
that are freed as a result of the shrinker being triggered.

And our conversation had me start looking though reference to
virtio_balloon_free_page_stop. It looks like we call it for when we
unrealize the device or reset the device. It might make more sense for
us to look at pushing the status to DONE and forcing the iothread to
be flushed out.

I'm pretty sure it had some, as it went through several iterations as
I recall. However I don't think the review of the virtio interface was
very detailed as I think most of the attention was on the kernel
interface.

As far as trying to do this with page reporting it would be doable,
but I would need to use something like the command interface so that I
would have a way to tell the driver when to drop the reported bit from
the pages and when to stop/resume hinting. However it still wouldn't
resolve the issue of copy on write style pages where the page is only
read and never updated. I honestly wonder if it wouldn't be better to
just apply the same logic that I have been doing with page reporting
and migrate a zero page for a hinted page and MADVISE the page away so
that it should be zero on the origin. Then you get the benefit of the
guest shrinking as you perform the migration and would only be
transmitting zero pages to the other side which should be
significantly smaller if I am not mistaken.
