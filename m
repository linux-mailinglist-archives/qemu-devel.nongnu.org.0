Hi, Alistair,

Thank you for reminding me.
I already had the local patch, so I re-submitted the patch.
Please let me know if that's fair enough (or you have any other comments)

Thanks,

Dayeol

&gt;<br>
&gt; This fixes an issue that prevents a RISC-V CPU from executing instruct=
ions<br>
&gt; immediately from the base address of a PMP TOR region.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; When jumping to an instruction in a PMP TOR region, pmp_hart_has_privs=
() is<br>
&gt; called to validate the access. If this instruction is the very first w=
ord of a<br>
&gt; PMP TOR region, at address 0 relative to the start address of the regi=
on, then<br>
&gt; the access will fail. This is because pmp_hart_has_privs() is called w=
ith size<br>
&gt; 0 to perform this validation, causing this check...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; e =3D pmp_is_in_range(env, i, addr + size - 1);<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ... to fail, as (addr + size - 1) falls below the base address of the =
PMP<br>
&gt; region. Really, the access should succeed. For example, if I have a re=
gion<br>
&gt; spanning 0x80d96000 to 0x88d95fff and the CPU jumps to 0x80d96000, the=
n:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; s =3D 0x80d96000<br>
&gt; e =3D 0x80d95fff<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; And the validation fails. The size check proposed below catches these =
zero-size<br>
&gt; instruction fetch access probes. The word alignment in pmpaddr{0-15} a=
nd<br>
&gt; earlier instruction alignment checks should prevent the execution of<b=
r>
&gt; instructions over the upper boundary of the PMP region, though I&#39;m=
 happy to give<br>
&gt; this more attention if this is a concern.<br>
<br>
This seems like a similar issue to this patch as well:<br>
<a href=3D"https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20191007052813.25814-1-dayeol=
@berkeley.edu/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://lore.kernel.or=
g/qemu-devel/20191007052813.25814-1-dayeol@berkeley.edu/</a><br>
<br>
From that discussion:<br>
<br>
&quot;In general, size 0 means &quot;unknown size&quot;.=C2=A0 In this case=
, the one tlb lookup is<br>
going to be used by lots of instructions -- everything that fits on the pag=
e.&quot;<br>
<br>
Richard&#39;s last comment seems like a better fix:<br>
<br>
&quot;You certainly could do<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 if (size =3D=3D 0) {<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 size =3D -(addr | TARGET_PAGE_MASK);<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 }<br>
<br>
to assume that all bytes from addr to the end of the page are accessed.=C2=
=A0 That<br>
would avoid changing too much of the rest of the logic.<br>
<br>
That said, this code will continue to not work for mis-aligned boundaries.&=
quot;<br>
<br>
So I don&#39;t think this is the correct solution. I&#39;m not sure if Daye=
ol<br>
is planning on sending a follow up version. If not feel free to send<br>
it.<br>
