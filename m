Thank you for such a detailed testing of my screamer patch. Your tests =
show it is an improvement over the older screamer implementation :)

I'm hoping the maintainer will review my patch soon. I haven't heard a =
thing from him since late December. I thinking either he does not have =
the time to review my patch or he does not want to see his patch be =
replaced with mine.=20

For the binaries of QEMU you provide on emaculation.net, would you say =
it is time to replace the old screamer builds with this patch?=20
