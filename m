Hi all,

Here's the second version of the multi-phase reset proposal patches.

# DESCRIPTION

Basically the reset procedure is split in 3 parts:
INIT PHASE: Reset the object internal state, put a resetting flag and do =
the
    same for the reset subtree. No side effect on other devices to guaran=
tee
    that, in a reset domain, everything get initialized first. This corre=
sponds
    mostly to what is currently done in the device/bus reset method.

HOLD PHASE: This phase allows to control a reset with a IO. When a IO con=
trol
    reset procedure based on the IO level (not edge), we may need to asse=
rt
    the reset, wait some time, and finally de-assert the reset. The conse=
quence
    is that such a device can stay in a "resetting state" and may need to=
 show
    this state to other devices through its outputs. For example, a clock
    controller will typically shutdown its clocks when it is in resetting=
 state.

EXIT PHASE: This phase sets outputs to state after reset. For a clock con=
troller
     it starts the clocks. It also clears the "resetting" flag. A device =
should
     not react to inputs until this flag has been cleared. During this ph=
ase,
     outputs are propagated.

The Resettable interface is detailed in the added doc in patch 7.

# CHANGE SINCE V1

The series now focus only on the Resettable interface (no more ResetDomai=
n).
Proposed changed have been applied:
 - reset_count getter/modifier methods
 - a foreach_child method

This last method allows some flexibility on what is the hierarchy of rese=
t.
There is some discussion ongoing about this point. Althought the series d=
oes
not aim to modify the qdev/qbus-centric reset behavior, it is not fixed. =
An
object specialization can override it.

# RESET DEPRECATION

There is 3 changes in the current way of handling reset (for users or
developers of Devices)

1. qdev/qbus_reset_all

Theses functions are deprecated by this series and should be replaced by
direct call to device_reset or bus_reset. There is only a few existing ca=
lls
so I can probably replace them all and delete the original functions.

2. old's device_reset

There is a few call to this function, I renamed it *device_legacy_reset* =
to
handle the transition. This function allowed to reset only a given device=
=20
(and not its eventual qbus subtree). This behavior is not possible with
the Resettable interface. At first glance it seemed that it is used only =
on=20
device having no sub-buses so we could just use the new device_reset.
But I need to look at them more closely to be sure. If this behavior is r=
eally
needed (but why would we not reset children ?), it's possible to do a spe=
cific
function for Device to to 3-phases reset without the children.

3. DeviceClass's reset and BusClass's methods

This is the major change. The method is deprecated because reset methods =
are
now located in the interface class. In the series, I make the init phase
redirect to the original reset method of DeviceClass (or BusClass). There=
 a
lot of use of the method and transitioning to 3-phases only reset will ne=
ed
some work.

# MIGRATION

Bus reset state migration is right now not handled.

Regarding "migration-during-reset should Just Work, without necessarily
needing any specific changes for a device". The included patch define a v=
msd
subsection which must to be added to every device main vmsd structure for
migration-during-reset of theses devices to work. I tried to find a way t=
o
avoid that but really don't see how to achieve that.

So in the current state of this series, migration can only be supported f=
or
leaf device (in term of qdev/qbus) where we add the subsection.

I'm not sure the migration is the problem here. I doubt a device will
support staying in reset state (which is a new feature) without manual
intervention. So migration of this unsupported state without any specific
change may not be a real asset.

The series is organised as follow:
 - Patch   1 adds Resettable interface
 - Patches 2 and 3 rename device_reset function by device_legacy_reset to=
 prepare
   the transition.
 - Patches 4 to 6 make the changes in Device and Bus classes.=20
 - Patches 7 add some doc
 - Patches 8 to 12 modify the xilinx_zynq to add 3-phases reset support i=
n the
   uart and the slcr (the reset controller).

Thank you for your feedback,
Damien
