Yeah, this is what makes F_GETLK/F_SETLK such an awful thing to
use. It is just about managable if an app is single threaded
and the developer can examine all code paths to make sure there
are no other open FDs referring to the same underling file.
If code has multiple FDs open, and/or is a multithreaded app,
F_SETLK is really fragile / error prone.

In QEMU proper, we used the fallback to F_GETLK/F_SETLK because
we were adding locking to existing features. If we didn't have
the fallback then we would either be breaking existing usage by
mandating OFD locks, or leaving those users with no locking at
all by disabling locking entirely.

For a program like virtiofsd that is brand new functionality
we don't have to worry about breaking existing users. Thus I
would strongly recommend we just mandate OFD locks, and entirely
disable the build of virtiofsd if OFD is missing on the host.

RHEL-7's 3.10 kernel *does* have OFD locking as it was backported
and QEMU in RHEL-7 already uses this. Users just need to make
sure they have updates applied to their RHEL-7 hosts to get this.

Daniel
