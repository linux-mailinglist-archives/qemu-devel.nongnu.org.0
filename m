See the History, generic coverage in SVN commit b6f97c14f59, then commit
fd5d5c566af keep all under target-sh4/, in ddb13561ac4 Aurelien steps
in, 2c9b7d1ab4e degraded to odd-fixes, the in fcf5ef2ab52 Thomas Huth
split hw/ VS target/.

I can read datasheets, so I am confident I can keep an eye to the
hardware and avoid its code to bitrot, highlighting I can only spend
humble hobby time on this.

I have less interest in the TCG code, so I prefer not touch it (thus,
left to Aurelien).

Well, he is automatically Cc'ed when these files are modified, but I
haven't seen him make comment on the list.

As a side note, I once told Yoshinori that Renesas SH4 and Renesas RX
were having almost identical peripheral cores, and he recently sent a
nice series merging both hw:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg08584.html

Which is why an unique 'Renesas Hardware' entry might make sense, and I
welcome Yoshinori if he wants to maintain it.

Then SH4/RX machines would be different entries.

After that, hw/sh4/r2d.c and hw/sh4/shix.c are indeed the only files
left in hw/sh4/. I am confident I can keep them in good shape.

I still want to insist that this will be during hobbyist time, based on
best effort. If someone else has time to do this, or can even be paid by
a company to look a it, I am more than happy to let him/her takes the role.

Regards,

Phil.
