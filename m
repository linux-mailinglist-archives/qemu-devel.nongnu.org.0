That is an excellent point, which I had not previously considered.

I have confirmed that there is indeed not, at present, a way to
disable the secure transition.  But, it looks like it's not too late
to fix it.

I've discussed with Paul Mackerras, and early in the secure transition
apparently the UV makes a call to the HV, which is allowed to fail.

So, we're looking at adding another KVM capability for secure mode.
It will default to disabled, and until it is explicitly enabled, KVM
will always fail that call from the UV, effectively preventing guests
=66rom going into secure mode.

We can then wire that up to a new spapr cap in qemu, which we can also
use to configure these virtio defaults.
