It prevents the use of non-FIPS crypto in QEMU, so it isn't that
inaccurate.

I think it can go.

FIPS support in QEMU is only needed if using our own crypto code which
lacks FIPS compliance, which essentially means our Single DES impl.

Anyone who cares about FIPS should be building QEMU with crypto provided
by libgcrypt. This will take care of FIPS compliance automatically,
so there's nothing QEMU needs do itself.
