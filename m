This approach is a compromise trying to create more or less usable interfac=
e.
In particular we (I and Daniel) wanted the following to work:

1. ability to add a new password to an empty keyslot and then remove the
old password. This is probably the most common operation and it won't
require the caller to know anything about the keyslots.

2. Allow the user to not know the passwords of some keyslots.
For example if I want to add a new keyslot, I might  not know
some of the other keyslots. Specifying all the active keyslots,
on each amend would force the user to know all the passwords
(you can't 'extract' a password by reading a keyslot, since only
hash of it is stored there for the security reasons)


Thus the amend interface either allows you to add a keyslot (either a speci=
fic one,
or first free one), and to remove a keyslot (again, either a specific one, =
or
one that matches given password).

This can be done IMHO.
