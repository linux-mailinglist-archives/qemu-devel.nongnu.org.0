Thank you so much for helping my old synapses finally fire!  Option 2 is
not what we thought it is.  Let me explain.

Introspection reports *all* QAPI integer types as "int".  This is
deliberate.

So, when the client that negotiated the interoperability capability sees
"int", it has to accept *both* integer encodings: JSON number and JSON
string.

The difference between option 1 and option 2 for the client is that
option 2 will use only one encoding.  But the client must not rely on
that!  Another QEMU version may well use the other encoding (because we
narrowed or widened the QAPI integer type in the QAPI schema).

Elsewhere in this thread, David pointed out that option 1 complicates
testing QEMU: full coverage requires passing both a small number (to
cover JSON number encoding) and a large number (to cover JSON string
encoding), to which I replied that there are very few places to test.

Option 2 complicates testing clients: full coverage requires testing
with both a version of QEMU (or a mock-up) that uses wide integers
(encoded as JSON string) and narrow integers (encoded as JSON number).
Impractical.

With option 2, QEMU *has* to be liberal in what it accepts, because the
client cannot deduce from introspection whether the integer is wide or
narrow.

Daniel, you wrote you'd probably suggest option 2.  Would you like to
reconsider?
