Because with the request queue cleared, there's nothing for
monitor_qmp_requests_pop_any_with_lock() to pop, so
monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher() won't look at this monitor.  It stays
suspended forever.  Correct?

Observable effect for the monitor's user?

Can you explain why this condition is correct?

Is monitor_qmp_cleanup_req_queue_locked() the correct place?

It's called from

* monitor_qmp_event() case CHR_EVENT_CLOSED via
  monitor_qmp_cleanup_queues(), as part of destroying the monitor's
  session state.

  This is the case you're trying to fix.  Correct?

  I figure monitor_resume() is safe because we haven't really destroyed
  anything, yet, we merely flushed the request queue.  Correct?

* monitor_data_destroy() via monitor_data_destroy_qmp() when destroying
  the monitor.

  Can need_resume be true in this case?  If yes, is monitor_resume()
  still safe?  We're in the middle of destroying the monitor...
