Hi Prasad,

Just my 2c as someone working on a downstream distro with Qemu...

While that is true, some aliases have managed to do something here by
having a single key for the alias, and behind the scenes that
re-encrypts the e-mail for each member of that alias (trying to avoid
the 'list' term a little here)

An example of this is the 'distro's list, e.g.:

- https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

I believe there was some resistance in the Linux kernel security space
of having things like a pre-announce message of a security issue that
has come in but is not fixed yet...

If you're looking to announce before a security issue is fixed, it
may just be better to keep it to the qemu-security members, which should
try to include at least 1, if not more, members from interested distros.
I know from past kernel security issues, it is still important to a
distro to be able to reproduce any issues if a PoC is provided.

There are some existing mechanisms for announcing security issues once
found, e.g. oss-security:

- https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security

A lot of distros have people on this list already monitoring it and many
OSS projects do send announcements of CVEs and security issues to this,
once resolved and an embargo period has expired - including Qemu, as I'm
sure that you know, given I've seen postings from you (Prasad) there.

Why would this not be enough for that?

These are all very important points - and the need for an embargo period
can be vital where Qemu/KVM is being widely deployed in a company.

I would agree that Gitlab may be better here, if it would work - Gitlab
can certainly be configured to restrict access to specific projects, but
I'm not sure how that would play into logging an issue if you can't even
see the project in question as a non-member of the security team.

But I don't really know the internal workings of Gitlab, maybe there is
a way to do it.

Thanks,

Darren.
