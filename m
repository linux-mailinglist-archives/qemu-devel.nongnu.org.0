It's certainly worth having a look at vhost-user even if you don't use
most of it;  you can configure it down to 1 (maybe 0?) queues if you're
really desperate - and you might find it comes in useful!  The actual
setup is pretty easy.

The process of synchronising with (potentially changing) host memory
mapping is a bit hairy; so if we can share it with vhost it's probably
worth it.
