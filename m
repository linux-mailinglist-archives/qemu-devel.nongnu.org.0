Not that I like it but as a quick fix, does following work for you?

Maybe, but I don't know about Xen enough so it's hard to make a suggestion,
so lets try to think out of the way to figure out how to approach it.

(In general, I'd prefer to get rid of dependency on 'accel' in memory_region_init_ram())

adapting xen code to use memdev isn't straightforward, since xen_ram_init()
fixes up memory_region size, it could be user provided
  ram_size
or
  4G + ram_size - HVM_BELOW_4G_RAM_END

question is why do you need to use memory_region_init_ram() at all if you are not actually
doing any allocation?
