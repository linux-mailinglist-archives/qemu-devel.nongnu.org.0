OK, I will use full name in v2.

If the threshold exceed 100% and the dirty rate is between 100% and threshold, then throttling
will not be started, so the migration will not converge and last an uncertain time until the workload
in guest is down by itself. So I think that the threshold exceed 100% maybe not suitable :).
