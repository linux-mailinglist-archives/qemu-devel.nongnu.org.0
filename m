This originally came up for us at Google in multi-threaded guest binaries
using TCMalloc (https://github.com/google/tcmalloc). TCMalloc does not have
any special `at_fork` handling, so guest processes using TCMalloc spawn
subprocesses using a custom bit of code based on `clone(CLONE_VM)` (notably
*not* vfork()).

We've also been using this patch to work around similar issues in QEMU
itself when creating subprocesses with fork()/vfork(). Since QEMU (and
GLib) rely on locks to emulate multi-threaded guests that share virtual
memory, QEMU itself is also vulnerable to deadlocks when a guest forks.
Without this patch we've run into deadlocks with TCG region trees, and
GLib's `g_malloc`, there are likely others as well, since we could still
reproduce the deadlocks after fixing these specific problems.

The issues caused by using fork() in multi-threaded guests are pretty
tricky to debug. They are fundamentally data races (was another thread in
the critical section or not?), and they usually manifest as deadlocks,
which show up as timeouts or hangs to users. I suspect this issue happens
frequently in the wild, but at a low enough rate/user that nobody bothered
fixing it/reporting it yet. Use of `vfork()` with `CLONE_VM` is common as
mentioned by Alex. For example it is the only way to spawn subprocesses in
Go on most platforms:
https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/syscall/exec_linux.go#L218

I tried to come up with a good reproducer for these issues, but I haven't
been able to make one. The cases we have at Google that trigger this issue
reliably are big and they contain lots of code I can't share. When
compiling QEMU itself with TCMalloc, I can pretty reliably reproduce a
deadlock with a program that just calls vfork(), but that's somewhat
synthetic.

I agree it would be interesting to test against musl. I'm pretty sure it
would work (this patch only relies on POSIX APIs + Platform ABIs for TLS),
but it would be interesting to confirm.
