I think it's probably simpler to just tie this to the priv_spec. It's
not completely accurate, but it should be close enough. Otherwise we
have the risk of having too many version variables and it becomes a
pain for users to deal with.

If the unpriv spec is better, we could also introduce that. We will
probably need that one day for something else anyway.

If you feel that we really need a fext_ver (to avoid large software
breakage for example) then it's also ok, we just need to justify why.
