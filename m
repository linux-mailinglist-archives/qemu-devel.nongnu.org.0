Understandable :)

Agree.

We use @FOO: for two distinct things:

1. Right at the beginning of a comment block, it makes the comment block
a definition doc block for symbol FOO.

2. At the beginning of an argument section, it names the argument /
member being documented.

Example:

    ##
    # @QCryptoBlockOptionsBase:                         <-- 1.
    #
    # The common options that apply to all full disk
    # encryption formats
    #
    # @format: the encryption format                    <-- 2.
    #
    # Since: 2.6
    ##

We could switch just 2. to reST field list syntax, and either keep 1. as
is, or switch it to some other reST markup that works for us.

But even if we want this, we should do it on top, to avoid complicating
and delaying this series.
