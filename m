Sorry for taking a while to respond. Anyway, the above looks good to
me as a general direction, but note that you'll have to implement at
the very least the query-cpu-model-expansion QMP command for the
introspection to work.

query-cpu-model-baseline and query-cpu-model-comparison are two more
QMP command which, while perhaps not immediately applicabile, we will
want to implement at some point; more in general, what s390x is doing
with respect to CPU models is a good blueprint, according to the
libvirt developer who's the most involved with that specific area of
the project.
