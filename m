Yes, because we still stack-allocate the name in places, but 4k is too 
large for stack allocation.  But we're inconsistent on where we use the 
smaller 256-limit; the server won't serve an image that large, but 
doesn't prevent a client from requesting a 4k name export (even though 
that export will not be present).

Yeah, I guess it's time to just get rid of NBD_MAX_NAME_SIZE, and move 
away from stack allocations.  Should I do that as a followup to this 
patch, or spin a v3?

Maybe:

incorrect name length in server's list response

It was asserted earlier, but doing it again might not hurt, especially 
if I do the followup patch getting rid of NBD_MAX_NAME_SIZE

I'm leaning towards limiting ALL bitmaps to the same length (as we've 
already debated the idea of being able to convert an existing bitmap 
from transient to persistent).

Except that BME_MAX_NAME_SIZE is not (currently) in a public .h file.
