Title:
  [Feature Request] Battery Status / Virtual Battery

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  When using virtualization on notebooks heavily then virtual machines
  do not realize that they're running on a notebook device causing high
  power consumption because they're not switching into a optimized
  "laptop mode". This leads to the circumstance that they are trying to
  do things like defragmentation / virtus scan / etc. while the host is
  still running on batteries.

  So it would be great if QEMU / KVM would have support for emulating
  "Virtual Batteries" to guests causing them to enable power-saving
  options like disabling specific services / devices / file operations
  automatically by OS.

  Optionally a great feature would be to set virtual battery's status
  manually. For example: Current charge rate / charging / discharging /
  ...
