Public bug reported:

_apksigner_ uses binfmt to execute via _jarwrapper_, since it is a JAR.
We have a test suite that relies on _apksigner_ working.  It was running
fine in Ubuntu/bionic.  Since it was pegged to LTS, it got upgraded to
Ubuntu/focal and it stopped working.  This is likely because
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ is totally empty.  The "binfmt_misc" kernel
module shows as loaded:

$ grep binfmt /proc/modules
binfmt_misc 20480 1 - Live 0xffffffffc0452000

This relies on binfmt support in gitlab.com's CI runner setup, based on Doc=
ker.  binfmt works in containers there, for example on Ubuntu/bionic:
https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/jobs/516857857

Something in Ubuntu/focal broke this when running focal in the container on=
 the same Docker host runners:
https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/jobs/547148092

Debian's ci.debian.net lxc runners also have a similar problem, it might be=
 related:
https://salsa.debian.org/ci-team/debian-ci-config/-/issues/1
