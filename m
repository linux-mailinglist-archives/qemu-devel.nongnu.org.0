If you don't enable the preserve-arg[0] flag, old and new QEMU will
work.

If you enable the flag, only new QEMU with -0/QEMU_ARGV0 will work.

The best solution would be to force preserve-arg[0] with open-binary
flag and rely on AT_FDEXEC to detect the binfmt-misc environment, but
this breaks compatibility with existing environment and old QEMU.

Regarding the "binfmt-misc stuff is whole-system" problem, I've proposed
months ago a kernel based solution [1] to have a configuration per
namespace (chroot), but no one seems really interested (I think
maintainer is afraid by potential security issues).

Title:
  qemu-user: $0 incorrectly always reports absolute path

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  We just ran into an issue with the Perl package on Debian/m68k when
  being built with qemu-user [1].

  The problem can be boiled down to qemu-user always reporting absolute
  paths for the shell variable $0 no matter on how the command was
  invoked.

  A simple reproducer is this:

  On normal system (no emulation):

  root@nofan:~> sh -c 'echo $0'
  sh
  root@nofan:~>

  On qemu-user:

  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/# sh -c 'echo $0'
  /bin/sh
  (sid-m68k-sbuild)root@nofan:/#
