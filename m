I don't see why you would need to rewrite anything... you do have to
decompress the whole cluster, and the uncompressed cluster in memory
would have stale data, but you never need to use that data for anything,
let alone to return it to the guest.

Even if there's a COW, the new cluster would inherit the compressed
cluster's bitmap so the zeroized subclusters still read as zeroes.

It's the same with normal clusters, 'write -P 0xff 0 64k' followed by
'write -z 16k 16k'. The host cluster on disk still reads as 0xff but the
L2 entry indicates that part of it is just zeroes.
