Subcluster allocation in qcow2 is implemented by extending the
existing L2 table entries and adding additional information to
indicate the allocation status of each subcluster.

This patch documents the changes to the qcow2 format and how they
affect the calculation of the L2 cache size.

+== Extended L2 Entries ==
+
+An image uses Extended L2 Entries if bit 4 is set on the incompatible_features
+field of the header.
+
+In these images standard data clusters are divided into 32 subclusters of the
+same size. They are contiguous and start from the beginning of the cluster.
+Subclusters can be allocated independently and the L2 entry contains information
+indicating the status of each one of them. Compressed data clusters don't have
+subclusters so they are treated the same as in images without this feature.
+
+The size of an extended L2 entry is 128 bits so the number of entries per table
+is calculated using this formula:
+
+    l2_entries = (cluster_size / (2 * sizeof(uint64_t)))
+
+The first 64 bits have the same format as the standard L2 table entry described
+in the previous section, with the exception of bit 0 of the standard cluster
+descriptor.
+
+The last 64 bits contain a subcluster allocation bitmap with this format:
+
+Subcluster Allocation Bitmap (for standard clusters):
+
+    Bit  0 -  31:   Allocation status (one bit per subcluster)
+
+                    1: the subcluster is allocated. In this case the
+                       host cluster offset field must contain a valid
+                       offset.
+                    0: the subcluster is not allocated. In this case
+                       read requests shall go to the backing file or
+                       return zeros if there is no backing file data.
+
+                    Bits are assigned starting from the least significant
+                    one (i.e. bit x is used for subcluster x).
+
+        32 -  63    Subcluster reads as zeros (one bit per subcluster)
+
+                    1: the subcluster reads as zeros. In this case the
+                       allocation status bit must be unset. The host
+                       cluster offset field may or may not be set.
+                    0: no effect.
+
+                    Bits are assigned starting from the least significant

+                    Compressed clusters don't have subclusters,
+                    so this field is not used.

+-------------------
+All numbers shown in this document are valid for qcow2 images with normal

+
+Images with extended L2 entries need twice as much L2 metadata, so the L2
