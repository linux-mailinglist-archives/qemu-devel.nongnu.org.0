Let me try to think this through.

rule1 matches functions that propagate from a local variable @local_err
to parameter @errp.  It uses the ___ hack to reliably tag the function.
Later rules that should only apply to these functions can match ___.

These later rules each provide a part of the total error propagation
transformation.  They must transform exactly the @local_err and @errp
matched by rule1 in each function.

Your solution is to constrain the identifiers, i.e.

    identifier rule1.fn, rule1.local_err;

If rule1 matches only one function named foo(), and within that foo()
the local variable @local_err rule1 matches actually binds all
occurences of the identifier @local_err, the constraint is reliable.

Else, the constraint may still accept occurences of @local_err not bound
to the variable matched by rule1.

Example 1:

    int bar(Error **errp)
    {
        if (pred()) {
            Error *local_err =3D NULL;

            error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
            error_propagate(errp, local_err);
        } else {
            int local_err =3D 0;
            return local_err;
        }
        return 0;
    }

rule1 matches the first @local_err variable, and not the second one.  We
must transform occurences of the first one, and not occurences of the
second one.  We do transform all:

     int bar(Error **errp)
     {
    +    ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
         if (pred()) {
    -        Error *local_err =3D NULL;
    -
    -        error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
    -        error_propagate(errp, local_err);
    +        error_setg(errp, "zzzt");
         } else {
             int local_err =3D 0;
    -        return local_err;
    +        return *errp;
         }
         return 0;
     }

Example 2:

    int foo(Error **errp)
    {
        Error *local_err =3D NULL;

        error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
        error_propagate(errp, local_err);
        return 0;
    }

    int foo(Error **errp)
    {
        Error *err =3D NULL;
        int local_err =3D 0;

        error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
        error_propagate(errp, err);
        return local_err;
    }

rule1 matches @local_err in the first foo(), and @err in the second one.
We must transform @local_err in the first one(), and @err in the second
one.  We do transform both in both:

     int foo(Error **errp)
     {
    -    Error *local_err =3D NULL;
    +    ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();

    -    error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
    -    error_propagate(errp, local_err);
    +    error_setg(errp, "zzzt");
         return 0;
     }

     int foo(Error **errp)
     {
    -    Error *err =3D NULL;
    +    ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
         int local_err =3D 0;

    -    error_setg(&local_err, "zzzt");
    -    error_propagate(errp, err);
    -    return local_err;
    +    error_setg(errp, "zzzt");
    +    return *errp;
     }

Constraining only the variable identifier like I proposed is even less
reliable, as you demonstrated: then the issue in example 2 exists even
for differently named functions.

For a reliable solution, we could use perhaps use the ___ hack again:
have rule1 rename @local_err it actually matches.  But to be honest, my
appetite for another round of wrestling with Coccinelle isn't what it
used to be.

I think we can do without as long as we're well aware of the script's
limitations, and we're confident we can detect problematic cases.

Detecting transformation of multiple functions with the same name should
be easy.

Detecting occurences of identifiers not bound by a certain variable
should be feasible: we find and review every transformed function that
doesn't declare the variable in its outermost scope.

Since "well aware" is going to erode with time, we may want to delete
the script when we're done converting.

I wouldn't call it correct.  It's still unreliable, but less so than
without the function name constraint.  That makes it less wrong.

100% reliable would be nice, but not at any cost.  Something we're
reasonably confident to get right should be good enough.

To be confident, we need to understand the script's limitations, and how
to compensate for them.  I figure we do now.  You too?
