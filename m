Yes, I am using Libvirt and disabling the feature that way works, thank
you!

I can provide a patch. However I don't understand what you mean by: "but
we cannot just add it". If you cannot add it, the patch will be
rejected, right?

Title:
  Support for XSAVES intel instructions in QEMU

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Dear QEMU developers,

  I am running Hyper-V on qemu+kvm. During it initialization, it checks
  for XSAVES support: first it executes CPUID with EAX =3D 0xd and ECX =3D 1
  and looks at bit 3 in the returned value of EAX (Supports
  XSAVES/XRSTORS and IA32_XSS [1]), and then it reads the MSR
  IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 (index 0x48B) and looks at bit 20 (Enable
  XSAVES/XSTORS [2]). If CPUID shows that XSAVES is supported and the
  bit is not enabled in the MSR, Hyper-V decides to fail and stops its
  initialization. It used to work until last spring/summer where
  something might have changed in either KVM or QEMU.

  It seems that KVM sets the correct flags (in CPUID and the MSR) when the =
host CPU supports XSAVES. In QEMU, based on comments in target/i386/cpu.c i=
t seems that XSAVES is not added in
  builtin_x86_defs[].features[FEAT_VMX_SECONDARY_CTLS] because it might bre=
ak live migration. Therefore, when setting the MSR for the vcpu, QEMU is ma=
sking off the feature.

  I have tested two possible solutions:
  - adding the flag in .features[FEAT_VMX_SECONDARY_CTLS]
  - removing the support of the instruction in feature_word_info[FEAT_XSAVE=
].feat_names

  Both solutions work and Hyper-v is happily running. I can provide a
  patch for the solution you might consider applying. Otherwise, is
  there a better way to fix the issue?

  Qemu version: 4.2.0
  Kernel version: 5.5.4
  Qemu command: https://gist.github.com/0xabe-io/b4d797538e2160252addc1d1d6=

  Many thanks,
  Alexandre
