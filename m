If you can point to an example where --max-width helps, keep it, and
update the commit message to match.  Else, drop it.

Let me think that through.

The pattern with the cases other than error_prepend() omitted:

     fn(..., Error **errp, ...)
     {
    +   ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
        ...  when !=3D ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
        error_prepend(errp, ...);
        ... when any
     }

Tail of vfio_set_irq_signaling():

        name =3D index_to_str(vbasedev, index);
        if (name) {
            error_prepend(errp, "%s-%d: ", name, subindex);
        } else {
            error_prepend(errp, "index %d-%d: ", index, subindex);
        }
        error_prepend(errp,
                      "Failed to %s %s eventfd signaling for interrupt ",
                      fd < 0 ? "tear down" : "set up", action_to_str(action=
));
        return ret;
    }

The pattern's first ... matches a "shortest" path to an error_prepend(),
where "shortest" means "does not cross an error_prepend().  Its when
clause makes us ignore functions that already use ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE().

There are two such "shortest" paths, one to the first error_prepend() in
vfio_set_irq_signaling(), and one to the second.  Neither path to the
third one is not "shortest": they both cross one of the other two
error_prepend().

The pattern' s second ... matches a path from a matched error_prepend()
to the end of the function.  There are two paths.  Both cross the third
error_prepend().  You need "when any" to make the pattern match anyway.

Alright, I think I got it.  But now I'm paranoid about ... elsewhere.
For instance, here's rule1 with error_propagate_prepend() omitted:

    // Match scenarios with propagation of local error to errp.
    @rule1 disable optional_qualifier exists@
    identifier fn, local_err;
    symbol errp;
    @@

     fn(..., Error **errp, ...)
     {
         ...
         Error *local_err =3D NULL;
         ...
         error_propagate(errp, local_err);
         ...
     }

The second and third ... won't match anything containing
error_propagate().  What if a function has multiple error_propagate() on
all paths?  Like this one:

    extern foo(int, Error **);
    extern bar(int, Error **);

    void frob(Error **errp)
    {
        Error *local_err =3D NULL;
        int arg;

        foo(arg, errp);
        bar(arg, &local_err);
        error_propagate(errp, local_err);
        bar(arg + 1, &local_err);
        error_propagate(errp, local_err);
    }

This is actually a variation of error.h's "Receive and accumulate
multiple errors (first one wins)" code snippet.

The Coccinelle script transforms it like this:

     void frob(Error **errp)
     {
    +    ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE();
         Error *local_err =3D NULL;
         int arg;

The rule that adds ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() matches (it has ... when any),
but rule1 does not, and we therefore don't convert any of the
error_propagate().

The result isn't wrong, just useless.

Is this the worst case?

Possible improvement to the ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE() rule: don't use
"... when any" in the error_propagate() case, only in the other cases.
Would that help?

I think this is the only other rule with "..." matching control flow.

I'd say something like "I tried merging this into the following rule the

The idea is

    first instance of fn:
        fn not in fnprev
        fnprev[fn] =3D position of instance
        don't print
    second instance:
        fnprev[fn] is the position of the first instance
        print first two instances
    subsequent instances: fnprev[fn] is None
        print this instance

I might have screwed up the coding, of course :)

"Need to be careful" means "needs careful manual review", which I
believe is not feasible; see "Preface to my review of this script"
above.

But do we really need to be careful here?

This rule should apply only where we added ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE().

Except when rule chaining via function name fails us, but we plan to
detect that and review manually, so let's ignore this issue here.

Thanks to ERRP_AUTO_PROPAGATE(), @errp is not null.  Enabling
replacement of @local_err by @errp is its whole point.

What exactly do we need to be careful about?
