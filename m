... or we finally dare to let QEMU chose the "best" accelerator by
default if no "-accel" option has been specified...

Thus if no "-accel" has been specified, then use kvm/haxm/whpv if
possible or TCG otherwise. And if "-accel" has been specified, then only
use that accelerator and don't allow a second "-accel" to be specified.
