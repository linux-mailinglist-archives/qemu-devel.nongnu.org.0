We can't go smaller than one host-sized page, so this 64k region is the
smallest we can go. The assert in the next hunk, which was snipped
out of the reply, ensures that 64k is large enough to cover the maximum
number of VCPUs that could ever be configured. I don't think there's
anything else we should do at this time. If the pvtime structure grows,
or if we increase the maximum number of VCPUs to be larger than 1024,
then we can revisit this in order to determine when additional 64k pages
should be allocated.

For now, if it would help, I could extend the comment (which was also
snipped) to mention that 64k was chosen because it's the maximum host
page size, and that at least one host-sized page must be allocated for
this region.

Correct. We want the default value of the boolean (false) to mean
"not disabled", so the boolean must have a negative name in order
to mean "disabled" when it is true. I'm not opposed to
no_kvm_steal_time vs. kvm_no_steal_time, since the property name
is "kvm-steal-time". I think I ended up with the 'kvm' and 'no'
swapped by copy+pasting kvm_no_adjvtime. However that one is
appropriately named because the property name is "kvm-no-adjvtime".
I'll change this for v2.

kvm_arch_vcpu_load() unconditionally makes that request when pvtime
is enabled.
