Suspend/resume works fine for as long as we don't catch a 'delayed=20
response', meaning a response received while the devices suspend (and=20
.pre_save is called). With this device the troubles are starting when=20
having to deliver such a 'delayed response' because the whole=20
tpm_spapr_request_completed() has to be deferred until after resume,=20
otherwise the OS driver gets stuck. So, in tpm_spapr_request_completed()=20
we need to be able to query the backend whether it is suspending,=20
meaning whether its .pre_save() has been invoked and we received the=20
response due to polling. If so, we must not do anything in this function=20
at this time but do it in post_load and we need to remember this in a=20
field 'deliver_response'. I have this field now but the reason why I set=20
it was not correct, at least not for the tpm_emulator backend. In case=20
we do get a delayed response while in the tpm_spapr's pre_save function,=20
we do need to set the 'deliver_response' as well in order to call the=20
tpm_spapr_request_completed() in tpm_spapr_post_load() when resuming.

The easiest way to trigger all this is to read a TPM 2.0's PCRs inside a=20
VM and have libtpms instrumented with a sleep(4) in PCRRead() function=20
to cause enough delays to trigger the critical code when suspending the V=
M.

I'll repost with these fixes.
