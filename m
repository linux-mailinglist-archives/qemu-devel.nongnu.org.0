Yes, you can obviously pro-actively send data early as you as you 
appropriately deal with any potential changes that the guest might make. 
I'm not very familiar with exactly how QEMU handles this, so it might 
not be a problem - I just wanted to point out that we don't have 
separate access permissions.

At a very simple level you could do something like:

  normal_mapping = mmap(..., PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, ..., fd, 0);
  mte_mapping = mmap(..., PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_MTE, ..., fd, 0);

  /* access normal mapping as normal */
  normal_mapping[offset] = 0xf00 + normal_mapping[offset + 1];

  /* read tag from mte_mapping */
  uint64_t tag = ldg(&mte_mapping[offset]);

  /* write a new tag value (8)
   * NOTE: tags are stored in the top byte, hence the shift
   */
  stg(0x8ULL << 56, &mte_mapping[offset]);

Where stg() and ldg() are simple wrappers around the new instructions:

  stg:
         STG x0, [x1]
         RET

  ldg:
         LDG x0, [x0]
         RET

As you say above it may be possible to simply let the normal RAM and 
tags get out of sync. E.g. if you send all the normal RAM (marking 
read-only as you go), then all the tags (not changing the permissions) 
you will end up with all the pages that have remained read-only (i.e. 
the guest hasn't modified) being consistent on the destination. Pages 
that have been written by the guest will be inconsistent, but you were 
going to have to resend those anyway.

However for post-migration copy you need to copy *both* normal RAM and 
tags before resuming the guest. You might need special cases for this.

Ideally yes, you would want the VMM to have checked accesses for all 
it's internal data structures because that gives the maximum benefit 
from MTE.

Since virtio is effectively emulating a device it should be treated like 
a device - no tag checking and no tag storage used. This would be the 
obvious situation where you would use "normal_mapping" as above so tags 
wouldn't be visible or checked.

Really the VMM is only interested in guest tags for the migration case 
where it simply needs to preserve them. I don't expect the guest and VMM 
(or hypervisor) to communicate using tagged memory.
