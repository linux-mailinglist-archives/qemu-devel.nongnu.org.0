The check's purpose is to ensure we don't send events in capabilities
negotiation mode, i.e. between connect and a successful qmp_capabilities
command.

True, but I wonder how this can happen.  Can you explain?

Patchew reports this loses SHUTDOWN events.  Local testing confirms it
does.  Simplified reproducer:

    $ for ((i=3D0; i<100; i++)); do printf '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}=
\n{"execute": "quit"}' | upstream-qemu -S -display none -qmp stdio; done | =
grep -c SHUTDOWN
    84

In this test, the SHUTDOWN event was lost 16 out of 100 times.

Its emission obviously races with the assignment you add.

The comment preceding it provides a clue: after CHR_EVENT_CLOSED, we
know the input direction is gone, and we duly clean up that part of the
monitor.  But the output direction may or may not be gone, so we don't
touch it.  Your assignment touches it.  This is not the correct spot.
I can't tell you offhand where the correct spot is.  Perhaps Marc-Andr=C3=
=A9
can.
