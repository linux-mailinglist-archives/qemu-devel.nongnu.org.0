The previous comment was incorrect as well, but actually
qcow2_truncate_bitmaps_check() doesn=E2=80=99t return an error when there i=
s any
bitmap, but only if there are non-active bitmaps, or active bitmaps that
cannot be modified.  So for non-disabled bitmaps, we generally do

What am I looking for in the header dump?

The v2 -> v3 change?  I think a _img_info (| grep compat) would be
better suited (or just a =E2=80=9C$QEMU_IMG amend ... || echo ERROR=E2=80=
=9D).

(I don=E2=80=99t like changing that many dump-header outputs whenever the
header_length or the feature table length change for some reason.)

Also, I personally prefer self-testing tests, because I don=E2=80=99t trust
myself when I have to interpret the reference output on my own...  As
such, I think it would make sense to not just put those =E2=80=9C# fails=E2=
=80=9D
comments here, but an explicit test on $? instead.  (E.g. by
=E2=80=9C|| echo ERROR=E2=80=9D, although I can see that would be weird in =
the
expected-failure case as =E2=80=9C&& echo ERROR=E2=80=9D.)

Again, a grep for the image size would help focus the reference output.

(In addition, _img_info would give us snapshot information.  Might be
interesting.  So maybe the best thing would be to grep the image
version, image size, and snapshot list from the image info every time.)

Speaking of the image size.  Is it intentional that the size is changed
to 32 MB?  Should amend work more like a transaction, in that we should
at least do a loose check on whether the options can be changed before
we touch the image?

Also, there=E2=80=99s a problem of ordering here.  The command as you=E2=80=
=99ve written
doesn=E2=80=99t have this specific problem, but imagine the size was still =
128
MB before (just like the snapshot).  Then what the command does depends
on the order in which the operations are executed: If we change the
version first, the size cannot be changed because of the internal
snapshot.  If we change the size first, the version can no longer be
changed because the internal snapshot has a different size than the image.


(Hypothetical problems that turn out not to be any in practice:

Or, maybe more interesting: What if we try to amend to
compat=3D0.10,size=3D128M here?

If the size is changed first, the command will succeed, because then the
snapshot size matches the image size again.  If qemu-img attempts to
change the version first, the whole command will fail.

As I noted above, the size is indeed changed before the version (hence
us getting a 32 MB v3 image here), so the compat=3D0.10,size=3D128M amend
would indeed succeed.  But that=E2=80=99s luck.

OTOH, that means that if you have a v2 image with a snapshot and want to
make it a v3 image and resize it at the same time, that would fail by
the same logic, because the size cannot be changed for v2 images.  So
for that case it=E2=80=99d be bad luck.

But we always upgrade an image first in the amend process and downgrade
it last, to address specifically such cases: Allow adding new features
along with the upgrade, and strip unsupported features right before the
downgrade.  So that=E2=80=99s all good.  But I think it still shows that th=
e
dependencies are getting a bit hairy.)
