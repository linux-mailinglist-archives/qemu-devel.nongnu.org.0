There are two parts of this.  One is practical and has to do with
supporting a step-by-step transition.  Using ninja2make makes it trivial
to have make build products that depend on meson build products, and
this way bottom up is a natural direction to do the conversion, which is
bottom up.  You'd start from libqemuutil.a and code generators (tracing
+ QAPI), then go to the tools and the emulators.

The second is a design decision that simplifying the Make/meson
integration is *not* a goal.  Rather the goals are: 1) making the
transition easier on developers; 2) avoiding magic in meson.build at all
costs.  More specifically:

- it should remain trivial to do things that used to be trivial, and
most "make" invocations should be kept the same at least until
everything is converted and we can perhaps declare a flag day.  People
are used to "make check" or "make subdir-x86_64-softmmu", those should
continue to work while the transition is in progress.

- it should be possible to modify meson.build without knowing QEMU
specific details, and that should be _already_ possible now at the
beginning of the transition (to avoid creating technical debt).  This
means keeping the magic confined in Makefile rules and external scripts,
while having a pretty plain meson.build.

I expect testing might also require some hand-holding, because "meson
test" does not integrate with "make -j" and to keep supporting our "make
check-*" targets.  However, until the make->ninja flag day we could
generate tap-driver Makefile rules from "meson introspect --tests"
output.  Basically I'm dropping Makefile magic in favor of build rule
generators are written in high-level languages.

I agree; once all the build rules are converted the Makefile could be as
simple as

	all:
	include config.mak
	include tests/docker/Makefile.include
	include tests/vm/Makefile.include
	.NOTPARALLEL:
	%:
		ninja $@

	subdir-%-softmmu:
		ninja qemu-system-$*

	subdir-%-linux-user:
		ninja qemu-$*

	check:
		$(MESON) test

	check-%:
		$(MESON) test --suite $*

etc. (and likewise the configure script could just translate the command
line options before invoking meson).  But for now, since rules are
written half in meson and half in make, ninja2make seems the most
transparent way to integrate the two.

I agree, this is why it's important to have at least a standard meson.build.

Some knowledge of config-host.mak is needed, because meson.build uses
declare_dependency() instead of dependency() to link with libraries that
were already found by configure, but that's it.
