Really the only relevant factor here is that it's a RHEL7 host, which
has an old kernel (3.10 is misleading, since it has a *heap* of
backports, but support for the vsmt feature isn't one of them).

So more generally than this specific test, the question really is
whether we thinkg RHEL7 is still in wide enough use that we care to
keep supporting it with the latest upstream machine type.  I'm a bit
undecided on that.
