I'll fix up all the other points...

A page entry can get dropped without invalidating the TB (for example
the guest OS sets a page as non-exec). The TLB flush takes care of the
jump cache and there are no inter-page hardwired links so if a tb_find
goes there we would get the fault.

All of it - in_asm, op, op_opt, out_asm potentially. But I agree it's
far too hacky - c.f. above because we end up potentially delivering a
fault to the guest when we fail.

It would be nice if we could run the translation phase independently of
the CPU environment. Maybe the monitor could have it's own TCGContext
and call tcg_gen_code directly just for debug output? It would avoid
having to use safe work and all the rest of the stuff we don't actually
care about in tb_gen_code. I guess you could still use the sigsetjmp to
catch the inevitable exceptions from the code load?
