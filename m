And the warning will remind them of that.

I'm fine with that, although it makes for a bigger task.

I concur - as long as you either have ONLY non-raw (in which case=20
probing is safe), or ONLY raw (in which case no probing is necessary),=20
then not recording the backing format is safe.  It is only for formats=20
that allow both raw and non-raw backing, but which do not have space in=20
the image to document which of the two backing formats is expected,=20
where we have problems.
