First of all, major kudos for picking up this task.  It's so high in
importance to so many users (myself included) that I feel like I owe
you many truck loads of beers now. :)

For simplicity sake, I'd suggest starting with non-namespaced
approach.  It should be easier to move to a namespaced package if the
need arises.  Also, there are many ways to extend Python code without
necessarily requiring third party authors to register their packages
according to a namespace.

In the Avocado project, we have been using setuptools entrypoints with
a reasonable level of success.  Anyone can have code under any
namespace whatsoever extending Avocado, as long as it register their
entrypoints.

Having a venv is desirable, but it's not really necessary.  As long as
"python setup.py develop --user" is called, that user can access this
code without sys.path hacks.  And if the user chooses to use a venv,
it's just an extra step.

In the Avocado project, we have a `make develop` rule that does that
for the main setup.py file, and for all plugins we carry on the same
tree, which is similar in some regards to the "not at the project root
directory" situation here with "qemu/python/setup.py".

Like I said before, we may introduce a "make develop"-like
requirement, but after that, I don't think we'll loose anything.
Also, I think this is just a sign of maturity.  We should be using
Python as it's inteded to be used, and sys.path hacks is not among
those.

It may be too early to tell, but it's not clear to me how we'll keep
both the QEMU version supported by a given release, and its API
"level".

Are you proposing that we have, say, "python-qemu" version 10, being
the 10th API version, without any regard to the QEMU version
supported?  Or version 10.5.3 would mean 10th API version, intended
to support QEMU 5.3?

s/install/develop/ should be a better option here.  I mean, I'm
not aware of any reason to user install while developing.

- Cleber.
