People often forget to run the iotests before submitting patches or
pull requests - this is likely due to the fact that we do not run the
tests during our mandatory "make check" tests yet.
This patch series now changes the "auto" group to only include tests
that should be safe to run in all CI environments (including FreeBSD
and macOS!). Thus these iotests can now always be run during "make
check" automatically, too.

v2:
 - Use "auto" group instead of adding a new "ci" group
 - Adjusted the tests that are run automatically (after doing lots
   of CI runs on cirrus-ci.com, gitlab and travis)
 - Added patch to fix the current regression with the "qemu-io:"
   prefix in the master branch
 - Added a fix for iotest 005 on ext4 filesystems (skip it there)

Thomas Huth (8):
  tests/qemu-iotests: Fix output of qemu-io related tests
  tests/qemu-iotests/005: Add a sanity check for large sparse file
    support
  tests/qemu-iotests/check: Pick a default machine if necessary
  tests/qemu-iotests: Do not hard-code the path to bash
  cirrus / travis: Add gnu-sed and bash for macOS and FreeBSD
  tests/qemu-iotests: Remove the "_supported_os Linux" line from many
    tests
  tests/qemu-iotests/group: Re-use the "auto" group for tests that can
    always run
  tests: Run the iotests during "make check" again
