SSE2 is a mandatory part of the x86_64 ABI.

I sincerely doubt we care about testing 32-bit that does not have SSE, but even
then this patch set will not fail, as the kernel will not include the SSE
registers into the signal frame.  It would be the actual test cases for SSE
instructions that would SIGILL when run on a 32-bit guest w/o SSE.

No, the assert is really an assert, because we have also masked the --xfeatures
value against the set of features stored in the signal frame.  If the kernel
reports a feature in the signal frame for which there is no cpuid leaf, then
something is very confused somewhere.

I am not sure that we can validate that the features in the signal frame match
the --xfeatures value, because I *think* that features are omitted from the
XSAVE data structure when they are in init state.  E.g. when we have not yet
exercised the feature.

This caveat is definitely true of ARM SVE, and I found that if I asserted that
all of the SVE state was in the signal frame that the generated RISU test which
uses memory would fail the 1st checkpoint, because no SVE instructions had yet
been executed.

A careful reading of the XSAVE documentation, plus some experimentation, is
definitely required.  Maybe hand-craft a test case using XRSTOR, giving it a
save area that specifies all features to be reset to init state.
