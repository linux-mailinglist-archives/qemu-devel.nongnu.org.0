I don't know of a better approach. Please see section 4.2.2 Floating-Point 
Status and Control Register on page 124 in this document:

https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=power-isa-version-3-0

especially the definition of the FR and FI bits and tell me how can we 
emulate these accurately and use host FPU. Not using the FPU even when 
these bits are not needed (which seems to be the case for all workloads 
we've tested so far) seriously limits the emulation speed so spending time 
to emulate obscure and unused part of an architecture when not actually 
needed just to keep emulation accurate but unusably slow does not seem to 
be the right approach. In an ideal world of course this should be both 
fast and accurate but we don't seem to have anyone who could achieve that 
in past two years so maybe we could give up some accuracy now to get 
usable speed and worry about emulating obscure features when we come 
across some workload that actually needs it (but we have the option to 
revert to accurate but slow emulation for that until a better way can be 
devised that's both fast and accurate). Insisting on accuracy without any 
solution to current state just hinders making any progress with this.

Other PowerPC emulators also seem to not bother or have similar 
optimisation. I've quickly checked three that I know about:

https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/cpu/powerpc/ppcdrc.cpp#L1893
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/cpu/powerpc/ppcdrc.cpp#L3503
there's also something here but no mention of FI bit I could notice:
https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/cpu/powerpc/ppccom.cpp#L2023

https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/blob/master/src/xenia/cpu/ppc/ppc_hir_builder.cc#L428

https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/Core/PowerPC/Jit64/Jit_FloatingPoint.cpp

But I'm not sure I understand all of the above so hope this makes more 
sense to someone and can advise.
