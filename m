This is v2 of the series, but I don't see a changelog.

Can you please describe the motivation for this? If I understand
correctly, all of this is just to inform the guest of the host's
CPU0 nominal or max (if nominal isn't present?) frequency. Why
do that? What happens if the guest migrates somewhere where the
frequency is different? If this is for a special use case, then
why not come up with a different channel (guest agent?) to pass
this information?

Thanks,
drew
