To me, it's confusing that a frontend is expected to ack
VHOST_USER_F_PROTOCOL_FEATURES even though the ack can't have any effect
(because VHOST_USER_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES and
VHOST_USER_SET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES both have to work even if the ack
hasn't been received yet).

But, if the frontend is supposed to ack anyway, how about:
