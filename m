Please, could you comment on the series:

[PATCH v3 00/21] Multifd Migration Compression

That series integrated zstd/zlib compression on top of multifd,
advantages over "old" compression code are:
- We don't have to copy data back and forth
- The unit of compression is 512KB instead of 4kb
- We "conserve" the compression state between packets (this is specially
  interesting for zstd, that uses dictionaries)

I don't have handy results, but it looked for me like you:
- zstd has a way better latency than zlib (i.e. the packet cames sooner)
- And it compress much better

On the migration test (best possible case for a compressor, as we are
writting just one byte of each page, and we write the same value in all
pages):

- zlib: compress 512KB -> 2500 bytes
- zstd: compess 512KB -> 52 bytes (yeap, I tested several times, it
  looked too small)

See that I posted another patch to "delete" the old compression code.
Why?
- I have been unable to modify migration-test to test it and work
  reliablely (only way was to allow a really huge downtime)
- Even with slow networking (1Gigabit) I got really mixed results,
  because as it is so slow, the guest continue dirtying memory, and in
  my tests it was never a winner

Thanks, Juan.
