An alternate type is like a union type, except there is no
discriminator on the wire.  Instead, the branch to use is inferred
from the value.  An alternate can only express a choice between types
represented differently on the wire.

Yes.

A simple union can always be re-written as a flat union where the base
class has a single member named 'type', and where each branch of the
union has a struct with a single member named 'data'.  That is,

 { 'union': 'Simple', 'data': { 'one': 'str', 'two': 'int' } }

is identical on the wire to:

 { 'enum': 'Enum', 'data': ['one', 'two'] }
 { 'struct': 'Branch1', 'data': { 'data': 'str' } }
 { 'struct': 'Branch2', 'data': { 'data': 'int' } }
 { 'union': 'Flat': 'base': { 'type': 'Enum' }, 'discriminator': 'type',
   'data': { 'one': 'Branch1', 'two': 'Branch2' } }

This is from docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt.  One to put under your pillow
:)

Yes.

The one reason why I haven't done so already is the notational
overhead.  Therefore:

An object type similar to a Pascal variant record / Ada discriminated
type: any number of common members, plus any number of variants.  If
there are variants, then there is an additional common member, the tag.

introspect.json already works that way: have a look at SchemaInfoObject.

The part that takes actual thought is the QAPI schema language design:
how can we write such types with much less overhead than flat unions?

Listing the common members in 'base' when there are variants, but in
'data' when there are none, is a complication we can do without.

Sometimes, we want to reuse an existing enumeration type as for the tag.
Sometimes, we'd rather derive one from the variants.

Sometimes, we want to reuse an existing struct type for a variant.
Sometimes, we'd rather define the variant inline.

The spartan lower layer syntax will force some compromises.  For
instance, we can't do inline variants like

    { 'union' : 'InputEvent',
      'data'  : {
        'key: { 'key': 'KeyValue', 'down': 'bool' }
        ... } }

because we need the { } form for specifying properties other than the
type, e.g.

    { 'union': 'BlockdevOptions',
      ...
      'data': {
        ...  
        'replication': { 'type': 'BlockdevOptionsReplication',
                         'if': 'defined(CONFIG_REPLICATION)' },
        ... } }

Questions?
