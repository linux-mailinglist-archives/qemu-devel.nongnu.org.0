The patch is mostly code motion, moving the existing heapinfo stuff into
a separate function. That makes it really hard to see how you've
changed the values being returned. I'd love to see a two patch series,
one of which moves the code as-is and a second patch which fixes
whatever bugs you've found.

Title:
  ARM semihosting HEAPINFO results wrote to wrong address

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  This affects latest development branch of QEMU.

  According to the ARM spec of the HEAPINFO semihosting call:

  https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100863/0300/Semihosting-
  operations/SYS-HEAPINFO--0x16-?lang=3Den

  > the PARAMETER REGISTER contains the address of a pointer to a four-
  field data block.

  However, QEMU treated the PARAMETER REGISTER as pointing to a four-
  field data block directly.

  Here is a simple program that can demonstrate this problem:
  https://github.com/iNvEr7/qemu-learn/tree/newlib-bug/semihosting-
  newlib

  This code links with newlib with semihosting mode, which will call the
  HEAPINFO SVC during crt0 routine. When running in QEMU (make run), it
  may crash the program either because of invalid write or memory
  curruption, depending on the compiled program structure.

  Also refer to my discussion with newlib folks:
  https://sourceware.org/pipermail/newlib/2021/018260.html
