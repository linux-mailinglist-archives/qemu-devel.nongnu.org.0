Ah, that's what I was missing. So we indeed do more I/O than strictly 
necessary (by reading from the backing file or writing explicit zeroes 
rather than leaving unallocated or zero subclusters), but we are careful 
that the COW range of the operation puts the correct data into the head 
and tail (either from the backing file or explicitly zero) so that even 
though the status changes to N, the guest still sees the same contents.

I also agree that it is not worth trying to optimize to those later 
subclusters - it adds a lot of complexity for something that does not 
occur as frequently.  It is more important to optimize to the initial 
sequence of unalloc/zero clusters, but once we hit data, taking the 
penalty of COWing a few extra subclusters isn't going to be much worse.

I guess the other thing that helps is that even if there are 
intermediate invalid subclusters, ideally the caller of this function is 
setting nb_clusters according to its own scan of how many contiguous 
clusters are even available for us to attempt to write into.  So patch 
20/31 catches the case where we don't have contiguous clusters if any of 
the subclusters are invalid.  And in _this_ patch, it shouldn't really 
matter if we don't detect that we are overwriting what used to be an 
invalid subcluster with something that is now valid data.

I think you've convinced me that we are safe on what this function does. 
  In fact, if we rely on 20/31 checking for invalid subclusters when 
computing nb_clusters, we could probably assert that the start and end 
cluster in this function are not invalid, instead of adding the fail: 
label.  But even if you don't do that, I can live with:
