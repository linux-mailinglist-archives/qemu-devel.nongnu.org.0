Public bug reported:

qemu 4.0 compiled fom source.

nitor telnet:localhost:7103,server,nowait,nodelay

copying large files eg 2.4gb or reading them on a cifs mount in the guest c=
auses corruption every time. For smaller files 40-60mb corruption is more t=
han 50% of the time. tested by md5sum on cifs server, or on host machine vs=
. on guest vm.
corruption is seen only with 64bit guest using cifs with i82551 emulated ne=
twork device
ie. 32bit guest using cifs with i82551 emulated network device gives no cor=
ruption.

changing the emulated device to vmxnet3 removes the data corruption (see
below)

this corruption is repeatable. ie. I created new vm, call using top example=
, installed 64bit linux, mounted cifs share and copied 2.4gb file to /tmp t=
hen run md5sum "filecopied"
the md5sum is different every time. copy same file to the host, or to a 32b=
it guest with the same virtual network device and bridge and md5sums are co=
rrect. The host pysical network adapter is
