Not everything that has a network connection is a QOM object (in fact,
neither migration nor chardev nor nbd are QOM objects).

I guess it would be nice to have a single namespace for everything in
QEMU, but the reality is that we have a few separate ones. As long as we
consistently add a prefix that identifies the namespace in question, I
think that would work.

This means that if we're using node-name to identify the NBD connection,
the namespace should be 'block' rather than 'nbd'.

One more thing to consider is, what if a single object has multiple
connections? In the case of node-names, we have a limited set of allowed
characters, so we can use one of the remaining characters as a separator
and then suffix a counter. In other places, the identifier isn't
restricted, so suffixing doesn't work. Maybe prefixing does, but it
would have to be there from the beginning then.

And another thing: Do we really want to document this as limited to
network connections? Another common cause of hangs is when you have
image files on an NFS mount and the connection goes away. Of course, in
the end this is still networking, but inside of QEMU it looks like
accessing any other file. I'm not sure that we'll allow yanking access
to image files anytime soon, but it might not hurt to keep it at the
back of our mind as a potential option we might want the design to
allow.
