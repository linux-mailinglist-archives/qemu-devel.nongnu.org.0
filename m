Would this work: We add a new migration state MIGRATE_WAIT_UNPLUG (or
a better more generic name) which tells libvirt that migration has not
started yet because we are waiting for the guest. And extend the qmp
events for the migration state. When we know the device was
sucessfully unplugged we sent a qmp event DEVICE_DELETED or a new one
DEVICE_DELETED_PARTIALLY (not sure about that yet), let migration
start and set the migration state to active?

To do a partial unplug I imagine, we have to separate vfio(-pci) code
to differ between release of resources (fds, mappings etc) and unplug
(I haven't yet found out how it works in vfio). In the failover case
we only do the unplug part but not the release part.
