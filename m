The fact that their users are happy with this proves it reasonable.

Like Kubernetes/OpenShift, our configuration / control language has an
abstract syntax that permits use of JSON/YAML as concrete syntax.  They
support both, we support just JSON.  We could support YAML, too.

Digression: JSON is a poor choice for configuration files.  YAML is a
complex and confusing beast (it's spec is printed 116 pages, and
yaml-0.2.2/src is ~7kSLOC).  XML is XML, 'nuff said.  TOML is much
simpler than either of the two.

I consider human CLI syntax for QEMU a mostly solved *design* problem:
dotted keys.  It's an unsolved *implementation* problem: the CLI is a
tangled mess of almost two decades' worth of ideas, and only (some of)
the latest strands actually use dotted keys infrastructure.  The
proposed solution is CLI QAPIfication.  Gives us configuration file(s)
and introspection.

Dotted keys are merely yet another concrete syntax.  They're designed to
satisfy the CLI requirements we have, which include a measure of
compatibility to what's in the tangled mess.  They're reasonably usable
for simple stuff, but complex stuff can be too verbose to be readable.
They can't express all of the abstract syntax.  Tolerable, since they
provide an escape to JSON.  I recommend programs use the JSON escape
always.  Awkward for humans due to shell quoting.

Right.

We've grown used to configuring QEMU with gargantuan command lines.

Yes.

I see no need to argue about whether to keep dotted keys human CLI
syntax or throw it away.

What to do about it?

Here's an idea that hasn't been mentioned in this thread: a -writeconfig
that actually works.  After you configured QEMU in whatever ways you
rustled up on the 'net, you can -writeconfig the resulting command line
into a *modern* configuration file.

Experience tells that no matter how weird and bizarre a feature is, once
you attempt to remove it, it *will* find champions willing to fight for
it to the death.  I'm not trying to tell you "don't go there", only "if
you go there, go armed and prepared".

I acknowledge that pain in dealing with JSON without suitable tooling.
Worse when the wrong tooling gets in the way, e.g. shell quoting.

Dotted keys are differently awkward.

Daniel's point is (1) we've got bigger fish to fry, and (2) Kubernetes
has proven punting the complex part to JSON/YAML text files (where you
do have suitable tooling) is good enough.

He's right, and that's why I've aggressively ignored qmp-shell since
forever.

If you want to invest some cycles into reducing the pain, I recommend
investing in suitable tooling, not in creating yet another language,
which then needs suitable tooling.

If I wanted to invest, I'd consider creating an Emacs mode to talk to
QMP.  But I don't; see "bigger fish".

Ha!  Let's call it MarML for "Markus's Markup Language", spoken like
"Marmel", which means "marble" in some dialects of German.  Then we can
joke about me having lost my marbles in specifying my own markup
language.
