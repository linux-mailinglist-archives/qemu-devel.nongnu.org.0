Sure, I don't mind this being the first feature for the eventual libnbd
1.2 and nbdkit 1.16.

Maybe, but the extra cost of forking per request may have also made
obvious timing comparisons harder.  I'm just glad that nbdkit's
filtering system was flexible enough to do what I wanted, even if I did
have fun stringing together 6 filters :)

As in, maintain a backlog of requests that are needed but have not yet
been sent over the wire because of backlog, and merge those requests (by
splitting an existing large zero request into smaller pieces) if write
requests come in that window before actually transmitting to the NBD
server?  I know qemu has some write coalescing when servicing guest
behaviors; but I was testing on 'qemu-img convert' which does not depend
on guest behavior and therefore has already sent the zero request to the
NBD server before sending any data writes, so coalescing wouldn't see
anything to combine.  Or are you worried about qemu as the NBD server,
performing coalescing of incoming requests from the client?  But you are
right that some smarts about I/O coalescing at various points in the
data path may show some slight optimizations.

Stay tuned for my next cross-project post ;)  Hopefully in the next week
or so.
