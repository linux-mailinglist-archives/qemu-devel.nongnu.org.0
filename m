What is exactly the problem with netboot? I can hook up the OF's "net" to a backend (as I do for serial console and 
blockdev, in boot order) and GRUB will do the rest which is tftp/dhcp/ip (SLOF does just this and nothing more). If GRUB 
does not do this on POWER - I can fix this.

Or alternatively it is possible with my patchset to load petitboot (kernel + intramdisk, the default way of booting 
POWER8/9 baremetal systems) and that thing can do whole lot of things, we can consider it as a replacement for ROMs from 
devices (or I misunderstood what kind of netboot you meant).

The reason for killing SLOF is to keep one device tree for the entire boot process including 
ibm,client-architecture-support with possible (and annoying) configuration reboots. Having another firware won't help 
with that.

Also the OF1275 client interface is the way for the client to get net/block device without need to have drivers, I'd 
like to do just this and skip the middle man (QEMU device and guest driver in firmware/bootloader).

I'll post another RFC tomorrow to give a better idea.
