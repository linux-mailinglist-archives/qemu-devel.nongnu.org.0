Exactly, current git behaviour is solely "prettier" (at first thought only 
though), but does not address anything useful in real life.

Current git behaviour does cause real life problems though: Many email lists 
are munging emails of patch senders whose domain is configured for requiring 
domain's emails being DKIM signed and/or being subject to SPF rules (a.k.a 
DMARC). So original sender's From: header is then automatically replaced by an 
alias (by e.g. mailman): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC#From:_rewriting

For instance the email header:

From: "Bob Bold" <bold@foo.com>

is automatically replaced by lists by something like

From: "Bob Bold via Somelist" <somelist@gnu.org>

And since git currently always drops the From: line from the email's body if
sender == author, as a consequence maintainers applying patches from such 
lists, always need to rewrite git history subsequently and have to replace 
patch author's identity manually for each commit to have their correct, real 
email address and real name in git history instead of something like
"Bob Bold via Somelist" <somelist@gnu.org>

So what do you find "uglier"? I prefer key info not being lost as default 
behaviour. :-)
