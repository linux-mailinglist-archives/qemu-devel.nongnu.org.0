You probably want to include this into the Developer's Guide via
index.rst.

I think I'd copy that to this file. If I'm looking at the
documentation, I'd rather not go hunting for source code to find out
what structure you are talking about. Plus, as it's UAPI, I don't
expect it to change much, so it should be easy to keep the definitions
in sync (famous last words).

Let me take a quick stab at rewriting this paragraph (not sure if I
understood it correctly):

"Dirty pages are tracked when the device is in the stop-and-copy phase.
During the pre-copy phase, it is not possible to distinguish a dirty
page that has been transferred from the source to the destination from
newly dirtied pages, which would lead to repeated copying of the same
content. Therefore, pinned pages are only marked dirty during the
stop-and-copy phase." ?

Stray '|', probably should go on the next line?

s/not/not yet/, I think? (Disregarding any time frame here.)

Generally, I think this is useful information to have in the docs.
