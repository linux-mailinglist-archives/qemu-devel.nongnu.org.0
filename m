I don't disagree with your proposal, but the thing is, do we even need
another field/limit for case 1? For example, do we *really* need to
clamp sizes[2] (NBD_INFO_BLOCK_SIZE) in nbd/server.c and
max_io_sectors (SCSIBlockLimits) in hw/scsi/scsi-disk.c to to any kind
of "dynamic" limit?

Either way I can add another field (`max_pwrite`, maybe?) to
BlockLimits, as an infrastructure/hint, but what should be switched to
it, and what value should each block driver set it to, is probably
beyond what I can take.

IMHO my patches should be merged first (they are really just fixing a
regression and some bugs). If anyone finds it necessary and is capable
and willing to fix the insufficiency of BlockLimits, they can do it
afterwards with another patch series as an improvement. I can add a
patch to remove the clamping in nbd/server.c as a perhaps-temporary
measure to address the original issue, if desired.
