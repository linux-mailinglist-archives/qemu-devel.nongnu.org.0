I filed the duplicate #1840252 of this bug.

I think that the options SO_PEERCRED and SO_PEERSEC belong into the
context of SELINUX. So maybe the format of the paylod can be found in
the sources of libselinux?

I'd like to compile qemu with a local hack to work around my current
problem. Something like Matthias L=C3=BCscher suggested.

@Peter Maydell: could you point me to the location in the qemu source
where I could apply such a hack?

Title:
  QEMU mishandling of SO_PEERSEC forces systemd into tight loop

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  While building Debian images for embedded ARM target systems I
  detected that QEMU seems to force newer systemd daemons into a tight
  loop.

  My setup is the following:

  Host machine: Ubuntu 18.04, amd64
  LXD container: Debian Buster, arm64, systemd 241
  QEMU: qemu-aarch64-static, 4.0.0-rc2 (custom build) and 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3=
.1+dfsg-7)

  To easily reproduce the issue I have created the following repository:
  https://github.com/lueschem/edi-qemu

  The call where systemd gets looping is the following:
  2837 getsockopt(3,1,31,274891889456,274887218756,274888927920) =3D -1 err=
no=3D34 (Numerical result out of range)

  Furthermore I also verified that the issue is not related to LXD.
  The same behavior can be reproduced using systemd-nspawn.

  This issue reported against systemd seems to be related:
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11557
