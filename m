On the contrary, the way we handle this today *reduces* the burden
on everyone involved both QEMU, management apps & users. The amount
of code in QEMU for a machine type with zero back compat properties
is tiny. Simply having this is less burden for QEMU that having to
check whether we need it or not when adding breaking changes. Whether
a machine type has back compat props or not is irrelevant to the end
user / mgmt app, as machine types are opaque objects. They can simply
decide to use a particular machine type version baseline, and be
confident it will "do the right thing" on all targets.

Daniel
