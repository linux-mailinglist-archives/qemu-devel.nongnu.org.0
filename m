NB our files are not JSON documents, they are a concatenation of a list
of JSON documents.

If you use javascript mode, then emacs will highlight all the javascript
language keywords in the comments because it doesn't recognise "#" as a
comment - you need // or /* .. */ for comments in JavaScript

We could of course convert to genuinely use Javascript comment syntax
if we want to consider these files to be JavaScript code instead of
JSON data.

Yep, I'd have a preference for use of GList / GSList. Anything which
uses G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC() automatically gets support for
auto cleanup of GList, GSList and GQueue, deep free'ing each element.

https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Miscellaneous-Macros.html#g-autolist

Some of the io/ subsystem could start making more use of GIO APIs. We
didn't use GIO originally as our min-GLib version at the time meant
we couldn't use the functionality we needed.

I'd also suggest replacing  fprintf/printf/sprintf with the g*printf*
equivalents. The benefit here is that GLib guarantees that its variants
work the same way on Windows as on Linux. They pulled in the GNULIB
printf impl to replace Microsoft's broken impl.

There's various silly little things like ARRAY_SIZE vs G_N_ELEMENTS,
and __attribute__ macros - QEMU_NORETURN vs G_GNUC_NORETURN.
QEMU_BUILD_BUG_ON vs G_STATIC_ASSERT

There's QEMU's threads related wrappers. I vaguely there were a couple of
cases where GLib's threads APIs didn't do what we needed. Even if we can't
eliminate all our threads APIs, I expect we can cull alot.

There's util/buffer.{c.h} that can be replaced by GString or GArray.


There's some places where we have misc utility functions that we should
just contribute back to GLib upstream. eg our util/base64.c which offers
improved error checking on base64 decoding. GLib would benefit from this,
and while it won't help qemu immediately, in the long term it will.

The g_ascii_strtoll aren't a drop in replacement for qemu_strto*, as they
have intentionally different semantics from each other, so not an example
I was considering here.

The GLib functions are explicitly always using C-locale, while QEMU's
current places are honouring current locale.

There are some places in QEMU that really should be forcing C-locale,
and so g_ascii_strtoll would actually be a bug fix in those cases.
Other places simply have to stick with what they're currently using
to honour the locale.

If there are things missing that we consider important, a long term
better strategy would be to use the Python binding to libclang to
detect the problem, instead of trying to parse C code with Perl and
regexes.
