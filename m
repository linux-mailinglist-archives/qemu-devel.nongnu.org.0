Or at least it generates that much I/O - in the end, it can slow down
the backup by up to a multi-digit factor...

Unless you enable qemu-side caching this only works until the
block/cluster size of the source exceeds the one of the target.

But guests usually have a page cache, which is why in many setups qemu
(and thereby the backup process) often doesn't.
