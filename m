Hi Richard,

As far as I know, Guo Ren and Greentime are supporting RVV on Linux, 
based on the v0.7.1 QEMU implementation.
The main problem is that VLEN is not aÂ  fixed number.

Thanks for your advice. I will communicate with them.

When the Linux kernel released with RVV, I will push a new sigcontext 
structure here.
