Hi,

Thanks Saket for your feedback. As Dmitry mentioned, we're focusing on
video encoding and decoding, not camera. So, my reply was about how to
implement paravirtualized video codec devices.

Not really because the API which the vicodec provides is V4L2 stateful
decoder interface [1], which are also used by other video drivers on
Linux.
The difference between vicodec and actual device drivers is that
vicodec performs decoding in the kernel space without using special
video devices. In other words, vicodec is a software decoder in kernel
space which provides the same interface with actual video drivers.
Thus, if the QEMU implementation can forward virtio-video requests to
vicodec, it can forward them to the actual V4L2 video decoder devices
as well and VM gets access to a paravirtualized video device.

The reason why we discussed vicodec in the previous thread was it'll
allow us to test the virtio-video driver without hardware requirement.

Regarding Gstreamer, I intended this video decoding API [2]. If QEMU
can translate virtio-video requests to this API, we can easily support
multiple platforms.
I'm not sure how feasible it is though, as I have no experience of
using this API by myself...
