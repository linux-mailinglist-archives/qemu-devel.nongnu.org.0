In this case Tock (which is the OS used for OpenTitan) does car about
these features as it relies on interrupts generated by the HW to
complete the serial send task. It also just makes the QEMU model more
accurate.

Agreed. Lots of UARTs don't bother modelling the delay from the
hardware as generally it doesn't matter. In this case it does make a
difference for the software and it makes the QEMU model more accurate,
which is always a good thing.

So baud rate doesn't need to be modelled as we aren't actually sending
UART data, just pretending and then printing it.

I see your point. I just used the 4 as that is what the Cadence one
does. I don't think it matters too much as it's just the delay for a
timer (that isn't used as an accurate timer).

Yep, it's just a more complete model of that the HW does.
