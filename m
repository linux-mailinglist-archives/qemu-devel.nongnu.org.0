Sorry, yes, copied too much while thinking too little.

Getting rid of Optional was the whole point of the suggestion.

Whether this matters depends on the meaning of the individual attribute.

There can be attributes that can legitimately be None during most of
the lifetime of the object. These should clearly be Optional.

In many cases, however, the contract say that you must first call method
A that initialises the attribute and then you can call method B which
uses it.  Calling B without A would be a bug, so it's not an error
message that users should ever see. For developers who will then look at
the stack trace anyway, I don't think it should make a big difference.

Here, it's usually expected that the attribute is not None except during
phases where the object is mostly inactive anyway (like VMs before
launch or after shutdown). Then you can just not add the attribute yet
and access it without checks (which would only throw an exception
anyway) elsewhere.

I guess the way to have everything static would be splitting QEMUMachine
into QEMUVMConfig (which exists without a running QEMU instance) and
QEMUVMInstance (which gets a QEMUVMConfig passed to its constructor and
is directly tied to a QEMU process).

Not sure if it would be worth such a major change.

The major downside that I saw while reviewing this patch (besides having
extra code just for making the error message of what essentially a
failed assertion nicer) is that we have two names for the same thing, we
have both names in active use in the other methods, and I'll never be
able to remember which of _subp and _popen is the real attribute and
which is the property (or that they are related at all and changing one
will actually change the other, too) without looking it up.

I mean, I guess tools will tell me after getting it wrong, but still...

Properties can make a nice external interface, but I feel using them
internally while you don't avoid accessing the real attribute in methods
other than the property implementation is more confusing than helpful.

You can always express this kind of thing as object-with-feature
containing an object-without-feature.
