Title:
  9pfs file create with mapped-xattr can fail on overlayfs

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  QEMU Version: 3.1.0 as packaged in debian buster, but the code appears to=
 do the same in master.
  qemu command-line: qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1G -nographic -nic "user,model=
=3Dvirtio-net-pci,tftp=3D$(pwd),net=3D10.0.2.0/24,host=3D10.0.2.2" -fsdev l=
ocal,id=3Dfs,path=3D$thisdir/..,security_model=3Dmapped-xattr -device virti=
o-9p-pci,fsdev=3Dfs,mount_tag=3Dfs -drive "file=3D$rootdisk,if=3Dvirtio,for=
mat=3Draw" -kernel "$kernel" -initrd "$initrd" -append "$append"

  =

  I'm using CI that runs in a Docker container and runs a qemu VM with code=
 and results shared via virtio 9p.
  The 9p fsdev is configured with security_model=3Dmapped-xattr
  When the test code attempts to create a log file in an existing directory=
, open with O_CREAT fails with -ENOENT.

  The relevant strace excerpt is:

  28791 openat(11, ".", O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_PATH|O_DIRECTORY) =3D 20
  28791 openat(20, "src", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTO=
RY) =3D 21
  28791 fcntl(21, F_SETFL, O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY) =3D 0
  28791 close(20)                         =3D 0
  28791 openat(21, "client.log", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOF=
OLLOW, 0600) =3D 20
  28791 fcntl(20, F_SETFL, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NONBLOCK|O_NOFOLLOW) =3D 0
  28791 lsetxattr("/proc/self/fd/21/client.log", "user.virtfs.uid", "\0\0\0=
", 4, 0) =3D -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

  My hypothesis for what's going wrong is since the Docker container's
  overlayfs copies-up on writes, when it opens the file it's created a
  new version of the `src` directory containing a `client.log`, but this
  new src directory isn't accessible by file descriptor 20 and the
  lsetxattr call is instead attempting to set attributes on the path in
  the old `src` directory.

  Looking at the code, a fix would be to change `hw/9pfs/9p-local.c` and
  change `local_open2` to instead of calling `local_set_xattrat` to set
  the xattrs by directory file descriptor and file name, to have a
  version of local_set_xattrat` which uses `fsetxattr` to set the virtfs
  attributes instead of the `fsetxattrat_nofollow` helper.

  This reliably happened for me in CI, but I don't have access to the CI
  host or the time to strip the test down to make a minimal test case,
  and had difficulty reproducing the error on other machines.
