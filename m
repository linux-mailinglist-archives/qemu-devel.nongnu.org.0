[Jiewen] The PI specification Volume 4 - SMM defines EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_P=
ROTOCOL.Communicate() - It can be used to communicate between OS and SMM ha=
ndler. But it requires the runtime protocol call. I am not sure how OS load=
er passes this information to OS kernel.

As such, I think using ACPI SCI/GPE -> software SMI handler is an easier wa=
y to achieve this. I also recommend this way.
For parameter passing, we can use 1) Port B2 (1 byte), 2) Port B3 (1 byte),=
 3) chipset scratch register (4 bytes or 8 bytes, based upon scratch regist=
er size), 4) ACPI NVS OPREGION, if the data structure is complicated.
