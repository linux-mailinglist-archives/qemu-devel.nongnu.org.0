  sure, If the error is guest RAM, we need to test the guest.
  I mean if the RAM that is being used as QEMU RAM(not guest RAM), we sho=
uld not tell the guest.
  OR if another user space manually send SIGBUS to qemu, such as using "k=
ill -s SIGBUS xxx" commands, we should not tell the guest.

  According to our analysis, I also think it should call the function for=
 that case.
  But from my test, I see  kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu() is not called when K=
VM/Kernel delivers SIGBUS to QEMU main thread.
  So I am also confused. I haven't even dig into the reason yet.

 If anyone has done the test or knows the reason, welcome comments.

  I agree with you, we need to check why it does not call sigbus_handler(=
) for the SIGBUS delivered by kernel/KVM.
  But I think it can  put it in another series, this series we only handl=
e the SIGBUS_(BUS_MCEERR_AR), whether do you think it is OK?
  Of course I will update the comments that you ever mentioned.

  By the way, If using "kill -s SIGBUS xxx" command to send SIGBUS to QEM=
U main thread, it indeed will be handled by signalfd.
