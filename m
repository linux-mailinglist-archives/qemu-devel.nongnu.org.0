Thank you! I also tested AArch32 and the code works. Ship it!

Title:
  ARM: HCR.TVM traps are not implemented

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  On AARCH64, setting HCR.TVM to 1 is supposed to trap all writes to
  CTLR_EL1, TTBR0_EL1, TTBR1_EL1, TCR_EL1, ESR_EL1, FAR_EL1, AFSR0_EL1,
  AFSR1_EL1, MAIR_EL1, AMAIR_EL1, and CONTEXTIDR_EL1. However, it
  currently has no effect (QEMU emulator version 4.1.1).

  It is also likely that TRVM will not trap, but, I didn't verify this.
