e3af7c788b73a6495 was indeed one of the bad commits I tested during the
bisect. If I apply cfcca361d77142f25f on top of it, Windows starts up
normally instead of giving me a BSOD on bootup.

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
