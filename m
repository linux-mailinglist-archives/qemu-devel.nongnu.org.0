Oh yes, thank you for reminding me of this point.

Essentially this is the same use case as with the GNUTLS default crypto
policy in QEMU.

The tls-creds-x409 object type in QEMU has a "priority" property which
lets you set a GNUTLS priority string eg

    --object tls-creds-x509,id=3Dtls0,priority=3D@SYSTEM

In practice, however, libvirt never uses this because the QEMU configure
script has a --tls-priority arg and distros will use that arg to set the
desired priority at build time. eg Fedora/RHEL build QEMU with the
"--tls-priority=3D@QEMU,SYSTEM" string and libvirt hasn't bothered to
make use of the 'priority' arg for tls-creds-x509 as a result.

I'd expect similar to be done with EDK2 priority where Fedora/RHEL sets
a compile time ciphers/cacerts list in RPM build.

Contrary to what we did with GNUTLS though, libvirt might still allow
this to be overridden at runtime, since the handling of the ciphers
is not as smart as we get with GNUTLS priority setting.
