There's no point in new tcg globals.

Every fp operation can raise an exception, and therefore every fp operation
will flush tcg globals to memory.  Therefore there is no optimization to be
done at the tcg opcode level.

However, every fp operation calls a helper function, and the quickest thing to
do is store the inputs to env->(op, inA, inB, inC) in the helper before
performing the operation.

Before we even get to this deferred fp operation thing, there are several giant
improvements to ppc emulation that can be made:

Step 1 is to rearrange the fp helpers to eliminate helper_reset_fpstatus().
I've mentioned this before, that it's possible to leave the steady-state of
env->fp_status.exception_flags == 0, so there's no need for a separate function
call.  I suspect this is worth a decent speedup by itself.

Step 2 is to notice when all fp exceptions are masked, so that no exception can
be raised, and set a tb_flags bit.  This is the default fp environment that
libc enables and therefore extremely common.

Currently, ppc has 3 helpers called per fp operation.  If step 1 is handled
correctly, then we're down to 2 fp helpers per fp operation.  If no exceptions
need raising, then we can perform the entire operation with a single function call.

We would require a parallel set of fp helpers that (1) performs the operation
and (2) does any post-processing of the exception bits straight away, but (3)
without raising any exceptions.  Sort of like helper_fadd +
do_float_check_status, but less.  IIRC the only real extra work is categorizing
invalid exceptions.  We could even plausibly extend softfloat to do that while
it is recording the invalid exception.

Step 3 is to improve softfloat.c with Yonggang Luo's idea to compute inexact
from the inverse hardfloat operation.  This would let us relax the restriction
of only using hardfloat when we have already have an accrued inexact exception.

Only after all of these are done is it worth experimenting with caching the
last fp operation.
