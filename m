Keeping the test cases organized in subdirectories are a good
idea, but don't think this is going to help us when we need to
quickly enable/disable specific test cases on some CI systems.

Disabling a test case (or an entire category of test cases) known
to be failing on some CI systems should require a one line patch,
not moving files to a separate directory.
