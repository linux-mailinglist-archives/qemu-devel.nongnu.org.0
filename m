It isn't different. We went through the pain to extending libvirt
to know how to open many channels for multifd. We'll have todo
the same with this postcopy-pre-empt. To this day though, management
apps above libvirt largely don't enable multifd, which is a real
shame. This is the key reason I think we need to handle this at
the QEMU level automatically.

I think I didn't explain myself properly here. Today there are
two parts to postcopy usage in libvirt

  - Pass the "VIR_MIGRATE_POSTCOPY" when starting the migration.
    The migration still runs in pre-copy mode. This merely ensures
    we configure a bi-directional socket, so the app has the option
    to swtich to postcopy later

  - Invoke virDomainMigrateStartPostCopy  to flip from pre-copy
    to post-copy phase. This requires you previously passed
    VIR_MIGRATE_POSTCOPY to enable its use.

The first point using 'VIR_MIGRATE_POSTCOPY' should not exist.
That should be automaticaly negotiated and handled by QEMU.

Libvirt and mgmt apps should only need to care about whether
or not they call virDomainMigrateStartPostCopy to flip to
post-copy mode.

It can't do this today - that's why we need the new migration protocol
feature negotiation I describe below.

This is just inventing a new migration capability framework. We
can just use existing QMP for this.

'exec' can be made to work if desired. Currently we only create
a unidirectuional pipe and wire it up to stdin for outgoing
migration. Nothing stops us declaring 'exec' uses a socketpair
wired to stdin + stdout, and supprot invoking 'exec' multiple
times to get many sockets

Sure, you wouldn't want to functionally rely on it. It is mostly
just a debugging aid so you can port scan and show it is new
QEMU migration protocol not the old one.
