Excuse the delay. I believe the reason why I am unable to locate the error =
string "Interrupt not seen after set_features" in the OpenSolaris source co=
de is because it belongs to a proprietary driver that was not distributed w=
ith OpenSolaris. Rather than rely on source code I've had to debug this pro=
blem by observing Solaris 10's behaviour.

I previously linked https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1475/uata=
-7d.html that seems to indicate that this error is fatal.
Considering that the CMD646 IDE controller driver experiences a fatal error=
 during the bootstrapping of the system, I suspect that the file system on =
the CDROM might not be accessible.
I'm not sure if this is directly related to the unresponsive serial console=
 but I wouldn't be surprised.

When configuring devices, Solaris 10 uses the SET_FEATURE command on the CM=
D646 to set the transfer mode to MDMA mode.
From what I can tell, this is successful and the emulated IDE controller ra=
ises an interrupt acknowledging that the command was completed successfully=
. To determine whether or not this interrupt was successfully propagated to=
 Solaris 10, I made manual changes to ensure that the interrupt was not rai=
sed for this event at this specific time. This resulted in a new error from=
 Solaris 10 regarding "set_features".
- Solaris 10 appears to be able to see the interrupt from the completion of=
 the SET_FEATURE command.
- Solaris 10 appears to then perform two reads on the status register. From=
 what I understand, this has the side effect of clearing interrupts.
- Solaris 10 then writes to the device/head register.
- Solaris 10 then spins on ARTTIM23_INTR_CH1 expecting it to be set. When i=
t is not set, the operation times out and we are presented with the fatal e=
rror regarding set_features.

I am not intimately familiar with the workings of the CMD646 or the ATA spe=
cification so I can only speculate.
- If the interrupt that Solaris 10 expects is the one from the SET_FEATURE =
command, then Solaris 10 is not expecting reading from the status register =
to clear ARTTIM23_INTR_CH1.
- If the interrupt that Solaris 10 expects is not the one from the SET_FEAT=
URE command, then it must expect an interrupt to occur from writing to the =
device/head register.

I found it strange that Solaris 10 was spinning on ARTTIM23_INTR_CH1. Is it=
 possible that Solaris 10 is not expecting the values of ARTTIM23_INTR_CH1 =
and MRDMODE_INTR_CH1 to be synced? I made changes to disable the syncing an=
d the fatal error from Solaris 10 disappeared. Unfortunately, I can't tell =
whether or not this actually improved the emulation of Solaris 10 as the se=
rial console is still unresponsive.

If there is a bug in the Solaris 10 driver I would expect this error to be =
more widely referenced online. I suspect that the emulated CMD646 is not pe=
rfectly faithful to the hardware and this is causing problems for Solaris 1=
0.
I am not convinced that this problem is related to IRQ routing as Solaris 1=
0 appears to recognise interrupts when they happen (or don't). Because of t=
his, I don't think this error is related  to the DMA problem under MorphOS =
but I could be wrong.

Does anyone have any ideas that might explain why Solaris 10 insists that A=
RTTIM23_INTR_CH1 is set despite two previous reads of the status register?

Thanks,
Jasper Lowell.

It has been a while since I've looked at booting Solaris >=3D 10 but certai=
nly the messages above about set_features and the frozen console suggest th=
at something is going amiss with interrupt routing, although since Linux an=
d NetBSD were fine the last time I ran my OpenBIOS release tests then Solar=
is must be doing something different here.

Note that the serial interrupts are routed from the ebus into sabre so the =
first thing to check would be that the end-to-end routing from device to CP=
U looks correct when using Solaris.


ATB,
