Fair enough, I didn't even thought of that. I fully agree that
implementing this is silly.

Just to understand this, we have

compat=3D0.10, also known as v2, which is the classical qcow2 (and v1 is =
basically qcow)
and then we have compat=3D1.1 which is also known as v3, and once upon a =
time was supposed
to be called qcow3, but at the end remained qcow2.
