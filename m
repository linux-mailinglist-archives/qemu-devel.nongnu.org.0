Yes.

There are no impossible combinations to ignore or reject, and to
document.  Instead, introspection tells the whole story.

Done this way, we could easily support both a (string, bool tight) for
convenience and base64 blob for generality, if we want to.

But I stand by my opinion that the feature is simply not worth its keep.
To make me reconsider, show me actual uses.

It's too late if we decide it is.
