+title:  "KVM Forum 2023: Call for presentations"
+date:   2023-03-08 13:45:00 +0100
+categories: [presentations, conferences]
+---
+
+[KVM Forum](https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/2023/) is an annual event that presents
+a rare opportunity for KVM and QEMU developers and users to discuss the state
+of Linux irtualization technology and plan for the challenges ahead. Sessions
+include updates on the state of the KVM virtualization stack, planning for the
+future, and many opportunities for attendees to collaborate.
+
+This year's event will be held in Brno, Czech Republic on June 14-15, 2023.
+It will be in-person only and will be held right before the
+[DevConf.CZ](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) open source community conference.
+
+June 14 will be at least partly dedicated to a hackathon or "day of BoFs".
+This will provide time for people to get together and discuss strategic
+decisions, as well as other topics that are best solved within smaller groups.
+
+## Call for presentations
+
+We encourage you to submit presentations via the
+[KVM Forum CfP page](https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/2023/cfp).
+ Suggested topics include:
+
+* Scalability and Optimization
+* Hardening and security
+* Confidential computing
+* Testing
+* KVM and the Linux Kernel:
+  * New Features and Ports
+  * Device Passthrough: VFIO, mdev, vDPA
+  * Network Virtualization
+  * Virtio and vhost
+* Virtual Machine Monitors and Management:
+  * VMM Implementation: APIs, Live Migration, Performance Tuning, etc.
+  * Multi-process VMMs: vhost-user, vfio-user, QEMU Storage Daemon
+  * QEMU without KVM: Hypervisor.framework and other hypervisors
+  * Managing KVM: Libvirt, KubeVirt, Kata Containers
+* Emulation:
+  * New Devices, Boards and Architectures
+  * CPU Emulation and Binary Translation
+
+The deadline for submitting presentations is April 2, 2023 - 11:59 PM PDT.
+Accepted speakers will be notified on April 17, 2023.
+
+## Attending KVM Forum
+
+Admission to KVM Forum and DevConf.CZ is free. However,
+[registration](https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/2023/register/) is required and the
+number of attendees is limited by the space available at the venue.
+
+The DevConf.CZ program will feature technical talks on a variety of topics,
+including cloud and virtualization infrastructureâ€”so make sure to register
+for DevConf.CZ as well if you would like to attend.
+
+Both conferences are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment
+for everybody. Participants are expected to abide by the
+[Devconf.cz code of conduct](https://www.devconf.info/coc/)
+and [media policy](https://www.devconf.info/media-policy/).
