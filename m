Hello as far as I can tell, there is a major problem with PLIC
implementation. When decompiling DTB on virt board with X harts, I see
that hartid 0 has MEI and SEI, hartid 1 has MEI and SEI, etc... But when
configuring context 1 (hartid 0 SEI) no interrupt is generated, but
context 0, 2, 4 etc... work. So for me the problem is within PLIC or
RISC-V implementation... If anyone wants to correct it, I can help. Best
regards. Serge Teodori

Title:
  RISC-V PLIC enable interrupt for multicore

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello all,

  There is a bug in Qemu related to the enabling of external interrupts
  for multicores (Virt machine).

  After correcting Qemu as described in #1815078
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1815078), when we try to enable
  interrupts for core 1 at address 0x0C00_2080 we don't seem to be able
  to trigger an external interrupt  (e.g. UART0).

  This works perfectly for core 0, but fore core 1 it does not work at
  all. I assume that given bug #1815078 does not enable any external
  interrupt then this feature has not been tested. I tried to look at
  the qemu source code but with no luck so far.

  I guess the problem is related to function parse_hart_config (in
  sfive_plic.c) that initializes incorrectly the
  plic->addr_config[addrid].hartid, which is later on read in
  sifive_plic_update. But this is a guess.

  Best regards,
  Pharos team
