Possibly. But why would we when the source doesn't need the filter? We
don't change the image path before migration either.

I think the tricky part is coming up with rules and "keep the frontend
the same, the backend can change arbitrarily" is a very easy rule.

So apparently I wasn't completely wrong when I preferred just writing
bitmaps back to the image instead of transferring them in the migration
stream...

It's not really bound to the graph structure per se, but to node names
and for non-anonymous BlockBackends to the link between the BB and its
root node. The latter is part of the graph structure, but only a very
small part, and it exists only for legacy (non-blockdev) configurations.

Good idea, let's have the migration maintainers handle this.
