This happened to me as well, but I managed to find a solution, if I ban
the xpad driver through modprobe.d, then the problem disappear.

I added the following line:

    blacklist xpad

To this file: /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf, rebooted, and then I could use
my Xbox One S controller with Qemu, I am not sure if it's a xpad bug or
a hardware bug.

Title:
  Xbox One controller USB passthrough disconnections and stops

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I can't properly passthrough my Xbox One controller to a virtual
  machine; it causes USB disconnections on the host, ultimately
  preventing it to work (at all) on the guest

  I've seen a few other cases reported in other websites, which show the
  same symptoms:

  - https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/97dhbw/qemu_w10_xbox_one_control=
ler
  - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/452751/how-can-i-pass-through-=
an-xbox-one-controller-to-a-windows-vm-on-ubuntu

  This is sample:

      libusb: error [udev_hotplug_event] ignoring udev action bind
      qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
      qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
      qemu-system-x86_64: libusb_release_interface: -4 [NO_DEVICE]
      libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] File doesn't exist, wait 10 ms and try =
again
      libusb: error [_get_usbfs_fd] libusb couldn't open USB device
          /dev/bus/usb/003/016: No such file or directory

  I think this is a quite long-standing issue, as I've been experiencing
  through several versions, including the current one (3.1).

  I can reproduce this 100% of the times, on multiple host O/S
  distributions (the current one being based on Ubuntu 18.04 x86-64).

  I compile QEMU directly from source, and execute it via commandline;
  the command is very long, however, the relevant part is standard (I
  think):

      -usb \
      -device usb-tablet \
      -device usb-host,vendorid=3D0x$VGAPT_XBOX_PAD_VEND_ID,productid=3D0x$=
VGAPT_XBOX_PAD_PROD_ID \

  The guest is Windows 10 64bit.
