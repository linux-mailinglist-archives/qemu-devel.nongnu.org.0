I wanted to make sure why different qemu configs make it trigger or not,
and after finding seabios to be related the candidates were obvious.

Default config gets us:
BIOS directory    /usr/local/share/qemu

The long conf had:
--firmwarepath=3D/usr/share/qemu:/usr/share/seabios:/usr/lib/ipxe/qemu

Adding that to the short config which had most things disabled made it brea=
k as well.
Since it has much less moving parts having most other features disabled I'l=
l continue to use that.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
