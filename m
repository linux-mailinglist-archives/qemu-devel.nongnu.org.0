I think I can't do that in sii3112 becuase I need to pass irq to this fun=
c:

void ide_init2(IDEBus *bus, qemu_irq irq);

That's what all ide devices do so you probably mean ide emulation should=20
be qdevified in QEMU but that's way beyond fixing this Coverity warning.

)

That means other ide devices are likely also leaking just not noticed due=
=20
to g_free-ing the array. For sii3112 I can implement an unrealize functio=
n=20
that frees the allocated irqs which should fix it according the above.
