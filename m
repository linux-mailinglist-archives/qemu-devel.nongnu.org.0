This series allows using qemu-img rebase (without -u) on images that do
not have a backing file.  Right now, this fails with the rather cryptic
error message:

$ qemu-img rebase -b base.qcow2 foo.qcow2
qemu-img: Could not open old backing file '': The 'file' block driver req=
uires a file name

Yeah, well, OK.

With how rebase currently works, this would lead to the overlay being
filled with zeroes, however.  This is where patch 2 comes in and instead
makes rebase use blk_pwrite_zeroes() whenever it handles an area past
the input=E2=80=99s backing file=E2=80=99s EOF.

(Note that additionally we could try to punch holes in the overlay
whenever it matches the new backing file, but that=E2=80=99s something I=E2=
=80=99ll put
off for later.  (We don=E2=80=99t even have a reliable method for punchin=
g holes
into an overlay yet, although I would like to have such because it could
make active commit more efficient.))


And patch 3 adds the usual test.


v2:
- Patch 1: Added example to the commit message, and made a note that
           this is about rebase without -u [Eric]
