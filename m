For a simple program, --help can provide pretty much the same usage
information as the manual page.

For a beast like QEMU, that's hopeless.  But --help can still serve as a
quick reminder of syntax and such.

Another argument is consistency: as long as --help shows syntax for the
other options, it should probably show syntax for --object, too.

We can certainly discuss level of detail.  For instance,

    --blockdev [driver=3D]<driver>[,node-name=3D<N>][,discard=3Dignore|unma=
p]
               [,cache.direct=3Don|off][,cache.no-flush=3Don|off]
               [,read-only=3Don|off][,auto-read-only=3Don|off]
               [,force-share=3Don|off][,detect-zeroes=3Don|off|unmap]
               [,driver specific parameters...]
                           configure a block backend

is arguably hardly more useful than

    --blockdev [driver=3D]<driver>[,node-name=3D<node-name>][,<prop>=3D<val=
ue>,...]
                           configure a block backend

The screen space would arguably be better spend on explaining <driver>
and <node-name>.

By the way, we should pick *one* way to mark up variable parts, and
stick to it.  As it is, we have

    -machine [type=3D]name[,prop[=3Dvalue][,...]]
    -object TYPENAME[,PROP1=3DVALUE1,...]
    -blockdev [driver=3D]driver[,node-name=3DN][,discard=3Dignore|unmap]

Frankly, this sucks.  Let's not mindlessly duplicate the suckage into
the storage daemon's help.

What do you mean by "not used"?  vl.c:

            case QEMU_OPTION_object:
                opts =3D qemu_opts_parse_noisily(qemu_find_opts("object"),
                                               optarg, true);
                if (!opts) {
                    exit(1);
                }
                break;

I see.

Do we want to bake that knowledge into main()?  I guess your answer
would be "we already do, we call user_creatable_print_help()".

Shouldn't we do the same in both main()s then?

... to get rid of the nesting both for qemu-system-FOO (where we need
backward compatibility) and qemu-storage-daemon (where we don't).

We can also discuss getting rid of it only for qemu-storage-daemon.

Good points.

qmp_object_add(), hmp_object_add() and vl.c's main() each use their own
interface to a common core.

QMP command handlers accept arguments specified in the schema as
separate C arguments.  For qmp_object_add(), that's @qom-type, @id (both
strings) and @props (a QDict).  It uses user_creatable_add_type() to
create an instance of QOM class @qom-type, set QOM properties for @props
with a QObject input visitor, insert into the QOM composition tree as
directed by @id.

This is simply how QMP commands work.  They parse JSON text into a
QDict, then feed it to the QObject input visitor to convert to native C
types.  The only slightly unusual thing is that when we feed the QDict
to the visitor in the generated qmp_marshal_object_add(), the visitor
passes through @props verbatim, because it's of type 'any', leaving the
conversion to native C types to the command handler.

With 'gen': false, we bypass qmp_marshal_object_add().  qmp_object_add()
gets the QDict, and does all the conversion to C types work.  Same as
now, plus two more visit_type_str() for @qom-type and @id.

main() parses the option argument as QemuOpts "monitor".  It uses
user_creatable_add_opts(), which splits it into @qom-type, @id and
@props for user_creatable_add_type(), then calls it with the options
visitor.

This is how the options visitor wants to be used.  We parse a
key=3Dvalue,... string into a QemuOpts, then feed it to the options
visitor.

When I QAPIfied -blockdev (crudely!), I didn't use the options visitor,
because it is by design too limited for the job.  I created a new flow
instead: parse a key=3Dvalue,... string into a QDict with keyval_parse(),
then feed it to the QObject input visitor.

This leads me to the flow I'd like us to try in the storage daemon:
parse into a QDict with keyval_parse(), feed to the 'gen': false
qmp_object_add().

Does that make some sense?

I've glossed over hmp_object_add() so far, because it's tangential to
the problem at hand.  Just for completeness (and laughs, possibly
bitter): HMP command handlers accept arguments specified in .hx as a
single QDict.  For hmp_object_add(), that's a string parsed as QemuOpts
"monitor" converted to QDict.  hmp_object_add() converts it right back
to QemuOpts "monitor", then uses user_creatable_add_opts().

Ugh!  Need I say more?
