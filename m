The performance improvements are quite appealing.
In general offloading from higher layers into lower layers is necessary long term.

But the approach taken by patches 15 and 17 is a dead end. I don't see how it
can ever catch up with the pace of bpf development. As presented this approach
works for the most basic programs and simple maps. No line info, no BTF, no
debuggability. There are no tail_calls either. I don't think I've seen a single
production XDP program that doesn't use tail calls. Static and dynamic linking
is coming. Wraping one bpf feature at a time with virtio api is never going to
be complete. How FDs are going to be passed back? OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD ?
OBJ_PIN/GET ? Where bpffs is going to live ? Any realistic XDP application will
be using a lot more than single self contained XDP prog with hash and array
maps. It feels that the whole sys_bpf needs to be forwarded as a whole from
guest into host. In case of true hw offload the host is managing HW. So it
doesn't forward syscalls into the driver. The offload from guest into host is
different. BPF can be seen as a resource that host provides and guest kernel
plus qemu would be forwarding requests between guest user space and host
kernel. Like sys_bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE) can passthrough into the host directly.
The FD that hosts sees would need a corresponding mirror FD in the guest. There
are still questions about bpffs paths, but the main issue of
one-feature-at-a-time will be addressed in such approach. There could be other
solutions, of course.
