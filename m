+TIS interface
+-------------
+
+The QEMU TPM emulation implements a TPM TIS hardware interface
+following the Trusted Computing Group's specification "TCG PC Client
+Specific TPM Interface Specification (TIS)", Specification Version
+1.3, 21 March 2013. (see the `TIS specification`_, or a later version
+of it).
+
+The TIS interface makes a memory mapped IO region in the area
+0xfed40000-0xfed44fff available to the guest operating system.
+

+
+CRB interface
+-------------
+
+QEMU also implements a TPM CRB interface following the Trusted
+Computing Group's specification "TCG PC Client Platform TPM Profile
+(PTP) Specification", Family "2.0", Level 00 Revision 01.03 v22, May
+22, 2017. (see the `CRB specification`_, or a later version of it)
+
+The CRB interface makes a memory mapped IO region in the area
+0xfed40000-0xfed40fff (1 locality) available to the guest

+fw_cfg interface
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The bios/firmware may read the ``"etc/tpm/config"`` fw_cfg entry for
+configuring the guest appropriately.
+
+The entry of 6 bytes has the following content, in little-endian:
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+    #define TPM_VERSION_UNSPEC          0
+    #define TPM_VERSION_1_2             1
+    #define TPM_VERSION_2_0             2
+
+    #define TPM_PPI_VERSION_NONE        0
+    #define TPM_PPI_VERSION_1_30        1
+
+    struct FwCfgTPMConfig {
+        uint32_t tpmppi_address;         /* PPI memory location */
+        uint8_t tpm_version;             /* TPM version */
+        uint8_t tpmppi_version;          /* PPI version */
+    };
+
+ACPI interface
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The TPM device is defined with ACPI ID "PNP0C31". QEMU builds a SSDT
+and passes it into the guest through the fw_cfg device. The device
+description contains the base address of the TIS interface 0xfed40000
+and the size of the MMIO area (0x5000). In case a TPM2 is used by
+QEMU, a TPM2 ACPI table is also provided.  The device is described to
+be used in polling mode rather than interrupt mode primarily because
+no unused IRQ could be found.
+
+To support measurement logs to be written by the firmware,
+e.g. SeaBIOS, a TCPA table is implemented. This table provides a 64kb
+buffer where the firmware can write its log into. For TPM 2 only a
+more recent version of the TPM2 table provides support for
+measurements logs and a TCPA table does not need to be created.
+
+The TCPA and TPM2 ACPI tables follow the Trusted Computing Group
+specification "TCG ACPI Specification" Family "1.2" and "2.0", Level
+00 Revision 00.37. (see the `ACPI specification`_, or a later version
+of it)
+
+ACPI PPI Interface
+------------------
+
+QEMU supports the Physical Presence Interface (PPI) for TPM 1.2 and
+TPM 2. This interface requires ACPI and firmware support. (see the
+`PPI specification`_)
+
+PPI enables a system administrator (root) to request a modification to
+the TPM upon reboot. The PPI specification defines the operation
+requests and the actions the firmware has to take. The system
+administrator passes the operation request number to the firmware
+through an ACPI interface which writes this number to a memory
+location that the firmware knows. Upon reboot, the firmware finds the
+number and sends commands to the TPM. The firmware writes the TPM
+result code and the operation request number to a memory location that
+ACPI can read from and pass the result on to the administrator.
+
+The PPI specification defines a set of mandatory and optional
+operations for the firmware to implement. The ACPI interface also
+allows an administrator to list the supported operations. In QEMU the
+ACPI code is generated by QEMU, yet the firmware needs to implement
+support on a per-operations basis, and different firmwares may support
+a different subset. Therefore, QEMU introduces the virtual memory
+device for PPI where the firmware can indicate which operations it
+supports and ACPI can enable the ones that are supported and disable
+all others. This interface lies in main memory and has the following
+layout:

+
+The TPM implementation is split into two parts, frontend and
+backend. The frontend part is the hardware interface, such as the TPM
+TIS interface described earlier, and the other part is the TPM backend
+interface. The backend interfaces implement the interaction with a TPM
+device, which may be a physical or an emulated device. The split
+between the front- and backend devices allows a frontend to be
+connected with any available backend. This enables the TIS interface
+to be used with the passthrough backend or the swtpm backend.
+
+QEMU files related to TPM backends:

+ - ``include/sysemu/tpm_backend.h``
+ - ``include/sysemu/tpm_backend_int.h``
+
+The QEMU TPM passthrough device
+-------------------------------
+
+In case QEMU is run on Linux as the host operating system it is
+possible to make the hardware TPM device available to a single QEMU
+guest. In this case the user must make sure that no other program is
+using the device, e.g., /dev/tpm0, before trying to start QEMU with
+it.
+
+The passthrough driver uses the host's TPM device for sending TPM
+commands and receiving responses from. Besides that it accesses the
+TPM device's sysfs entry for support of command cancellation. Since
+none of the state of a hardware TPM can be migrated between hosts,
+virtual machine migration is disabled when the TPM passthrough driver
+is used.
+
+Since the host's TPM device will already be initialized by the host's
+firmware, certain commands, e.g. ``TPM_Startup()``, sent by the
+virtual firmware for device initialization, will fail. In this case
+the firmware should not use the TPM.
+
+Sharing the device with the host is generally not a recommended usage
+scenario for a TPM device. The primary reason for this is that two
+operating systems can then access the device's single set of
+resources, such as platform configuration registers
+(PCRs). Applications or kernel security subsystems, such as the Linux
+Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), are not expecting to share
+PCRs.

+
+The QEMU TPM emulator device
+----------------------------
+
+The TPM emulator device uses an external TPM emulator called 'swtpm'
+for sending TPM commands to and receiving responses from. The swtpm
+program must have been started before trying to access it through the
+TPM emulator with QEMU.
+
+The TPM emulator implements a command channel for transferring TPM
+commands and responses as well as a control channel over which control
+commands can be sent. (see the `SWTPM protocol`_ specification)
+
+The control channel serves the purpose of resetting, initializing, and
+migrating the TPM state, among other things.
+
+The swtpm program behaves like a hardware TPM and therefore needs to
+be initialized by the firmware running inside the QEMU virtual
+machine.  One necessary step for initializing the device is to send
+the TPM_Startup command to it. SeaBIOS, for example, has been
+instrumented to initialize a TPM 1.2 or TPM 2 device using this
+command.
+
+QEMU files related to the TPM emulator device:
+ - ``hw/tpm/tpm_emulator.c``
+ - ``hw/tpm/tpm_util.c``
+ - ``hw/tpm/tpm_util.h``
+
+The following commands start the swtpm with a UnixIO control channel ove=
r
+a socket interface. They do not need to be run as root.
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  mkdir /tmp/mytpm1
+  swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
+    --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
+    --log level=3D20
+
+Command line to start QEMU with the TPM emulator device communicating
+with the swtpm (x86):
+
+.. code-block:: console

+
+.. code-block:: console

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The TPM emulator supports the following types of virtual machine
+migration:
+
+- VM save / restore (migration into a file)
+- Network migration
+- Snapshotting (migration into storage like QoW2 or QED)
+
+The following command sequences can be used to test VM save / restore.
+
+In a 1st terminal start an instance of a swtpm using the following comma=
nd:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  mkdir /tmp/mytpm1
+  swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
+    --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
+    --log level=3D20 --tpm2
+
+In a 2nd terminal start the VM:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl -accel kvm \
+    -m 1024 -boot d -bios bios-256k.bin -boot menu=3Don \
+    -chardev socket,id=3Dchrtpm,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
+    -tpmdev emulator,id=3Dtpm0,chardev=3Dchrtpm \
+    -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=3Dtpm0 \
+    -monitor stdio \
+    test.img
+
+Verify that the attached TPM is working as expected using applications
+inside the VM.
+
+To store the state of the VM use the following command in the QEMU
+monitor in the 2nd terminal:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  (qemu) migrate "exec:cat > testvm.bin"
+  (qemu) quit
+
+At this point a file called ``testvm.bin`` should exists and the swtpm
+and QEMU processes should have ended.
+
+To test 'VM restore' you have to start the swtpm with the same
+parameters as before. If previously a TPM 2 [--tpm2] was saved, --tpm2
+must now be passed again on the command line.
+
+In the 1st terminal restart the swtpm with the same command line as
+before:
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
+    --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
+    --log level=3D20 --tpm2
+
+In the 2nd terminal restore the state of the VM using the additional
+'-incoming' option.
+
+.. code-block:: console
+
+  qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl -accel kvm \
+    -m 1024 -boot d -bios bios-256k.bin -boot menu=3Don \
+    -chardev socket,id=3Dchrtpm,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
+    -tpmdev emulator,id=3Dtpm0,chardev=3Dchrtpm \
+    -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=3Dtpm0 \
+    -incoming "exec:cat < testvm.bin" \
+    test.img
+
+Troubleshooting migration
+-------------------------
+
+There are several reasons why migration may fail. In case of problems,
+please ensure that the command lines adhere to the following rules
+and, if possible, that identical versions of QEMU and swtpm are used
+at all times.
+
+VM save and restore:
+
+ - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
+   '-incoming' option on VM restore
+
+ - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
+
+VM migration to 'localhost':
+
+ - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
+   '-incoming' option on the destination side
+
+ - swtpm command line parameters should point to two different
+   directories on the source and destination swtpm (--tpmstate dir=3D...=
)
+   (especially if different versions of libtpms were to be used on the
+   same machine).
+
+VM migration across the network:
+
+ - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
+   '-incoming' option on the destination side
+
+ - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
+
+VM Snapshotting:
+ - QEMU command line parameters should be identical
+
+ - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
+
+
+Besides that, migration failure reasons on the swtpm level may include
+the following:
+
+ - the versions of the swtpm on the source and destination sides are
+   incompatible
+
+   - downgrading of TPM state may not be supported
+
+   - the source and destination libtpms were compiled with different
+     compile-time options and the destination side refuses to accept the
+     state
+
+ - different migration keys are used on the source and destination side
+   and the destination side cannot decrypt the migrated state
+   (swtpm ... --migration-key ... )

-=3D ACPI Interface =3D
-
-The TPM device is defined with ACPI ID "PNP0C31". QEMU builds a SSDT and=
 passes
-it into the guest through the fw_cfg device. The device description cont=
ains
-the base address of the TIS interface 0xfed40000 and the size of the MMI=
O area
-(0x5000). In case a TPM2 is used by QEMU, a TPM2 ACPI table is also prov=
ided.
-The device is described to be used in polling mode rather than interrupt=
 mode
-primarily because no unused IRQ could be found.
-
-To support measurement logs to be written by the firmware, e.g. SeaBIOS,=
 a TCPA
-table is implemented. This table provides a 64kb buffer where the firmwa=
re can
-write its log into. For TPM 2 only a more recent version of the TPM2 tab=
le
-provides support for measurements logs and a TCPA table does not need to=
 be
-created.
-
-The TCPA and TPM2 ACPI tables follow the Trusted Computing Group specifi=
cation
-"TCG ACPI Specification" Family "1.2" and "2.0", Level 00 Revision 00.37=
. This
-specification, or a later version of it, can be accessed from the follow=
ing
-URL:
-
-https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/tcg-acpi-specification/
-
-=3D=3D ACPI PPI Interface =3D=3D
-
-QEMU supports the Physical Presence Interface (PPI) for TPM 1.2 and TPM =
2. This
-interface requires ACPI and firmware support. The specification can be f=
ound at
-the following URL:
-
-https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-physical-presence-interfa=
ce-specification/
-
-PPI enables a system administrator (root) to request a modification to t=
he
-TPM upon reboot. The PPI specification defines the operation requests an=
d the
-actions the firmware has to take. The system administrator passes the op=
eration
-request number to the firmware through an ACPI interface which writes th=
is
-number to a memory location that the firmware knows. Upon reboot, the fi=
rmware
-finds the number and sends commands to the TPM. The firmware writes the =
TPM
-result code and the operation request number to a memory location that A=
CPI can
-read from and pass the result on to the administrator.
-
-The PPI specification defines a set of mandatory and optional operations=
 for
-the firmware to implement. The ACPI interface also allows an administrat=
or to
-list the supported operations. In QEMU the ACPI code is generated by QEM=
U, yet
-the firmware needs to implement support on a per-operations basis, and
-different firmwares may support a different subset. Therefore, QEMU intr=
oduces
-the virtual memory device for PPI where the firmware can indicate which
-operations it supports and ACPI can enable the ones that are supported a=
nd
-disable all others. This interface lies in main memory and has the follo=
wing

-The TPM implementation is split into two parts, frontend and backend. Th=

-described earlier, and the other part is the TPM backend interface. The =
backend
-interfaces implement the interaction with a TPM device, which may be a p=
hysical
-or an emulated device. The split between the front- and backend devices =
allows
-a frontend to be connected with any available backend. This enables the =

-=3D=3D The QEMU TPM passthrough device =3D=3D
-
-In case QEMU is run on Linux as the host operating system it is possible=
 to
-make the hardware TPM device available to a single QEMU guest. In this c=
ase the
-user must make sure that no other program is using the device, e.g., /de=
v/tpm0,
-before trying to start QEMU with it.
-
-The passthrough driver uses the host's TPM device for sending TPM comman=
ds
-and receiving responses from. Besides that it accesses the TPM device's =
sysfs
-entry for support of command cancellation. Since none of the state of a
-hardware TPM can be migrated between hosts, virtual machine migration is
-disabled when the TPM passthrough driver is used.
-
-Since the host's TPM device will already be initialized by the host's fi=
rmware,
-certain commands, e.g. TPM_Startup(), sent by the virtual firmware for d=
evice
-initialization, will fail. In this case the firmware should not use the =
TPM.
-
-Sharing the device with the host is generally not a recommended usage sc=
enario
-for a TPM device. The primary reason for this is that two operating syst=
ems can
-then access the device's single set of resources, such as platform confi=
guration
-registers (PCRs). Applications or kernel security subsystems, such as th=
e
-Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), are not expecting to sha=
re PCRs.

-=3D=3D The QEMU TPM emulator device =3D=3D
-
-The TPM emulator device uses an external TPM emulator called 'swtpm' for
-sending TPM commands to and receiving responses from. The swtpm program
-must have been started before trying to access it through the TPM emulat=
or
-with QEMU.
-
-The TPM emulator implements a command channel for transferring TPM comma=
nds
-and responses as well as a control channel over which control commands c=
an
-be sent. The specification for the control channel can be found here:
-
-https://github.com/stefanberger/swtpm/blob/master/man/man3/swtpm_ioctls.=
pod
-
-
-The control channel serves the purpose of resetting, initializing, and
-migrating the TPM state, among other things.
-
-The swtpm program behaves like a hardware TPM and therefore needs to be
-initialized by the firmware running inside the QEMU virtual machine.
-One necessary step for initializing the device is to send the TPM_Startu=
p
-command to it. SeaBIOS, for example, has been instrumented to initialize
-a TPM 1.2 or TPM 2 device using this command.
-
-
-QEMU files related to the TPM emulator device:
- - hw/tpm/tpm_emulator.c
- - hw/tpm/tpm_util.c
- - hw/tpm/tpm_util.h
-
-
-The following commands start the swtpm with a UnixIO control channel ove=
r
-a socket interface. They do not need to be run as root.
-
-mkdir /tmp/mytpm1
-swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
-  --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
-  --log level=3D20
-
-Command line to start QEMU with the TPM emulator device communicating wi=
th
-the swtpm (x86):
-

-=3D=3D=3D Migration with the TPM emulator =3D=3D=3D
-
-The TPM emulator supports the following types of virtual machine migrati=
on:
-
-- VM save / restore (migration into a file)
-- Network migration
-- Snapshotting (migration into storage like QoW2 or QED)
-
-The following command sequences can be used to test VM save / restore.
-
-
-In a 1st terminal start an instance of a swtpm using the following comma=
nd:
-
-mkdir /tmp/mytpm1
-swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
-  --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
-  --log level=3D20 --tpm2
-
-In a 2nd terminal start the VM:
-
-qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl -accel kvm \
-  -m 1024 -boot d -bios bios-256k.bin -boot menu=3Don \
-  -chardev socket,id=3Dchrtpm,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
-  -tpmdev emulator,id=3Dtpm0,chardev=3Dchrtpm \
-  -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=3Dtpm0 \
-  -monitor stdio \
-  test.img
-
-Verify that the attached TPM is working as expected using applications i=
nside
-the VM.
-
-To store the state of the VM use the following command in the QEMU monit=
or in
-the 2nd terminal:
-
-(qemu) migrate "exec:cat > testvm.bin"
-(qemu) quit
-
-At this point a file called 'testvm.bin' should exists and the swtpm and=
 QEMU
-processes should have ended.
-
-To test 'VM restore' you have to start the swtpm with the same parameter=
s
-as before. If previously a TPM 2 [--tpm2] was saved, --tpm2 must now be
-passed again on the command line.
-
-In the 1st terminal restart the swtpm with the same command line as befo=
re:
-
-swtpm socket --tpmstate dir=3D/tmp/mytpm1 \
-  --ctrl type=3Dunixio,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
-  --log level=3D20 --tpm2
-
-In the 2nd terminal restore the state of the VM using the additional
-'-incoming' option.
-
-qemu-system-x86_64 -display sdl -accel kvm \
-  -m 1024 -boot d -bios bios-256k.bin -boot menu=3Don \
-  -chardev socket,id=3Dchrtpm,path=3D/tmp/mytpm1/swtpm-sock \
-  -tpmdev emulator,id=3Dtpm0,chardev=3Dchrtpm \
-  -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=3Dtpm0 \
-  -incoming "exec:cat < testvm.bin" \
-  test.img
-
-
-Troubleshooting migration:
-
-There are several reasons why migration may fail. In case of problems,
-please ensure that the command lines adhere to the following rules and,
-if possible, that identical versions of QEMU and swtpm are used at all
-times.
-
-VM save and restore:
- - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
-   '-incoming' option on VM restore
- - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
-
-VM migration to 'localhost':
- - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
-   '-incoming' option on the destination side
- - swtpm command line parameters should point to two different
-   directories on the source and destination swtpm (--tpmstate dir=3D...=
)
-   (especially if different versions of libtpms were to be used on the
-   same machine).
-
-VM migration across the network:
- - QEMU command line parameters should be identical apart from the
-   '-incoming' option on the destination side
- - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
-
-VM Snapshotting:
- - QEMU command line parameters should be identical
- - swtpm command line parameters should be identical
-
-
-Besides that, migration failure reasons on the swtpm level may include
-the following:
-
- - the versions of the swtpm on the source and destination sides are
-   incompatible
-   - downgrading of TPM state may not be supported
-   - the source and destination libtpms were compiled with different
-     compile-time options and the destination side refuses to accept the
-     state
- - different migration keys are used on the source and destination side
-   and the destination side cannot decrypt the migrated state
-   (swtpm ... --migration-key ... )
