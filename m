Again, the current virtio-video protocol and driver only support video
encoding and decoding. We had no detailed discussion about camera
supports.
Moreover, I personally disagree with supporting video capturing in
virtio-video protocol. Instead, I believe it's better to have a
separate protocol like "virtio-camera". Decoupling video codec APIs
and camera APIs should make protocols simpler and easier to maintain.
I suggested this idea in [1].

So, the answer to your question is:
No in virtio-video protocol. But, it's possible to start designing a
new "virtio-camera" protocol that supports camera features including
image processing.

It seems that we had miscommunication here. While I had mentioned
Gstreamer as a generic implementation to cover "video decoding" APIs
on various platforms, you were talking about "camera" APIs.
As I said above, virtio-video is NOT designed for cameras.

For abstraction of video decoding APIs, I don't know any better
library than Gstreamer. For cameras, libcamera sounds good, but I'm
not so familiar with this area...

Best regards,
Keiichi
