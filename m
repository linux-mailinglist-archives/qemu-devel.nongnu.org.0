Sure.

(01a) QEMU: create new CPU.  The CPU already exists, but it does not
     start running code until unparked by the CPU hotplug controller.

(01b) QEMU: trigger SCI

(02-03) no equivalent

(04) Host CPU: (OS) execute GPE handler from DSDT

(05) Host CPU: (OS) Port 0xB2 write, all CPUs enter SMM (NOTE: New CPU
     will not enter CPU because SMI is disabled)

(06) Host CPU: (SMM) Save 38000, Update 38000 -- fill simple SMM
     rebase code.

(07a) Host CPU: (SMM) Write to CPU hotplug controller to enable
     new CPU

(07b) Host CPU: (SMM) Send INIT/SIPI/SIPI to new CPU.

(08a) New CPU: (Low RAM) Enter protected mode.

(08b) New CPU: (Flash) Signals host CPU to proceed and enter cli;hlt loop.

(09) Host CPU: (SMM) Send SMI to the new CPU only.

(10) New CPU: (SMM) Run SMM code at 38000, and rebase SMBASE to
     TSEG.

(11) Host CPU: (SMM) Restore 38000.

(12) Host CPU: (SMM) Update located data structure to add the new CPU
     information. (This step will involve CPU_SERVICE protocol)

(13) New CPU: (Flash) do whatever other initialization is needed

(14) New CPU: (Flash) Deadloop, and wait for INIT-SIPI-SIPI.

(15) Host CPU: (OS) Send INIT-SIPI-SIPI to pull new CPU in..


In other words, the cache-as-RAM phase of 02-03 is replaced by the
INIT-SIPI-SIPI sequence of 07b-08a-08b.

But since the hotplug controller would only be accessible from SMM,
there would be no other way to invoke it than to follow the DSDT's
instruction and write to 0xB2.  FWIW, real hardware also has plenty of
0xB2 writes in the DSDT or in APEI tables (e.g. for persistent store
access).
