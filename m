No argument.

qdev C layer:

    frob->prop = 42;

Least cognitive load.

QOM has no C layer.

qdev property layer works even when @frob has incomplete type:

    qdev_prop_set_int32(DEVICE(frob), "prop", 42);

This used to map property name to struct offset & copy the value.
Simple, stupid.

Nowadays, it is the same as

    object_property_set_int(OBJECT(frob), "frob", 42, &error_abort);

which first converts the int to a QObject, then uses a QObject input
visitor with a virtual walk to convert it back to int and store it in
@frob.  It's quite a sight in the debugger.

qdev "text" layer is really a QemuOpts layer (because that's what we had
back then).  If we have prop=42 in a QemuOpts, it calls

    set_property("prop", "42", frob, &err);

Nowadays, this is a thin wrapper around object_property_parse(),
basically

    object_property_parse(frob, "prop", 42, &err);

Fine print: except set_property() does nothing for @prop "driver" and
"bus", which look just like properties in -device / device-add, but
aren't.

object_property_parse() uses the string input visitor, which I loathe.

Yes.  There are good reasons for QOM.

That's fair.

The question is whether that 1% really should be done the way it is done
:)
