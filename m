Let me ignore rST details for a bit.

The prevailing schema style looks like this:

    # @file: Node to create the image format on
    # @size: Size of the virtual disk in bytes
    # @log-size: Log size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB
    #            (default: 1 MB)
    # @block-size: Block size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB and not
    #              larger than 256 MB (default: automatically choose a bloc=
k
    #              size depending on the image size)
    # @subformat: vhdx subformat (default: dynamic)
    # @block-state-zero: Force use of payload blocks of type 'ZERO'. Non-st=
andard,
    #                    but default.  Do not set to 'off' when using 'qemu=
-img
    #                    convert' with subformat=3Ddynamic.

Peter's patch converts to it.  Can't fault him for converting to the
prevailing style.

Trouble is the prevailing style is ugly, and can waste massive amounts
of screen real estate when both the identifier and the explaining text
are long.

block*.json's style looks like this:

    # @file:             Node to create the image format on
    # @size:             Size of the virtual disk in bytes
    # @log-size:         Log size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB
    #                    (default: 1 MB)
    # @block-size:       Block size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB an=
d not
    #                    larger than 256 MB (default: automatically choose =
a block
    #                    size depending on the image size)
    # @subformat:        vhdx subformat (default: dynamic)
    # @block-state-zero: Force use of payload blocks of type 'ZERO'. Non-st=
andard,
    #                    but default.  Do not set to 'off' when using 'qemu=
-img
    #                    convert' with subformat=3Ddynamic.

I dislike this style, too.  It's less ugly, until you add a longer
member.  Then you either accept inconsistent indentation, or reindent
all the other members.  Blech.

Here's a style I'd dislike less:

    # @file: Node to create the image format on
    #
    # @size: Size of the virtual disk in bytes
    #
    # @log-size: Log size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB
    #     (default: 1 MB)
    #
    # @block-size: Block size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB and not
    #     larger than 256 MB (default: automatically choose a block
    #     size depending on the image size)
    #
    # @subformat: vhdx subformat (default: dynamic)
    #
    # @block-state-zero: Force use of payload blocks of type 'ZERO'.
    #     Non-standard, but default.  Do not set to 'off' when using
    #     'qemu-img convert' with subformat=3Ddynamic.

Or maybe even

    # @file:
    # Node to create the image format on
    #
    # @size:
    # Size of the virtual disk in bytes
    #
    # @log-size:
    # Log size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB (default: 1 MB)
    #
    # @block-size:
    # Block size in bytes, must be a multiple of 1 MB and not larger
    # than 256 MB (default: automatically choose a block size depending
    # on the image size)
    #
    # @subformat:
    # vhdx subformat (default: dynamic)
    #
    # @block-state-zero:
    # Force use of payload blocks of type 'ZERO'.  Non-standard, but
    # default.  Do not set to 'off' when using 'qemu-img convert' with
    # subformat=3Ddynamic.

With both these styles, member names stand out reasonably well, and I
don't have to fiddle with indentation when adding or removing members.
With the second one, I don't have to fiddle with indentation at all.

The second one might be the better fit for rST, but that's for Peter to
judge.
