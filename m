The interrupt presenters are currently parented to their associated
VCPU, and we rely on CPU_FOREACH() when we need to perform a specific
task with them. Like exposing their state with 'info pic', or finding
the target VCPU for an interrupt when using the XIVE controller.

We recently realized that the latter could crash QEMU because CPU_FOREACH()
can race with CPU hotplug. This got fixed by checking the presenter pointer
under the CPU was set (commit 627fa61746f7), but I'm not that sure that
this is enough since the presenter pointers also get stale at some point
during CPU unplug. And we still have other users of CPU_FOREACH(), namely
'info pic' with both XICS and XIVE, that have the very same problem:

With XIVE:

Thread 1 "qemu-system-ppc" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000001003d2848 in xive_tctx_pic_print_info (tctx=0x101ae5280, 
    mon=0x7fffffffe180) at /home/greg/Work/qemu/qemu-spapr/hw/intc/xive.c:526
526         int cpu_index = tctx->cs ? tctx->cs->cpu_index : -1;
(gdb) p tctx

(gdb) p tctx->cs
$2 = (CPUState *) 0x2057512020203a5d <-- tctx is stale
(gdb) p tctx->cs->cpu_index
Cannot access memory at address 0x205751202020bead

With XICS:

Thread 1 "qemu-system-ppc" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00000001003cc39c in icp_pic_print_info (icp=0x10244ccf0, mon=0x7fffffffe940)

$2 = (CPUState *) 0x524958203220 <-- icp is stale
(gdb) p icp->cs->cpu_index

It may be worth finding a way to address this globally instead of
open-coding the check of the presenter pointer everywhere because
this is fragile. I gave a try with this series:

	[0/6] ppc: Reparent the interrupt presenter

	https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/1182224/

but it requires some more reflexion. Also, we're about to enter
softfreeze, and it seems better to come up with a simpler fix.

Let's forget the reparenting and check the presenter pointers
where needed instead. Patch 1 from the previous series was changed
to also NULLify presenter pointers, so that they can be used to
filter out unwanted vCPUs in patch 3. I've kept patch 2 because
it's a fix in the same area, but it isn't related to the QEMU
crashes.
