Jiaxun, hi.

My advice is to think about integrating Loongson-relared test into QEMU "in
background", with the intention that you possibly develop them later on.

Let's focus first on the code you want to add to enhance core
Loongson-related QEMU features, and we'll help you later on about Loongton
tests that could also be added to QEMU upstream.

I am sure you have some informal tests for all code you develop, but there
is a long way from these tests to the test that can be integrated in QEMU
upetream.

Just for reference, and something for you to think about in breaks between
real coding:

Basically, in QEMU, there are several kind of tests you could have in mind:

1) Unit tests yhat typically test emulation of just a single instruction
(see /tests/tcg/mips/user/ase/msa for example);

2) Acceptance test that test boot/shutdown and possibly other features of
virtual machines prepared in advance (kernel, rootfs, etc.), residing in
test/acceptance;

3) Tests that may use tests made for libraries and applicstions that use
the functionality of your newly-added features;

4) Other test that you may devise by your own and think are usefull and
make sense.

But again, let's focus and show us the main body of your code (as you
already started doing), let's start from there, and see how is it going and
what happens.

Thanks again for your work so far!

Yours,
Aleksandar
