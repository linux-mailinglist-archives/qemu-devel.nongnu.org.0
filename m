Well, the MSR state at the moment of the breakpoint is that of the
currently executing instruction. So this gets called with mmu_on = true
very often because we're often debugging code than runs with IR|DR=1.

However, we could be at a point when IR|DR=1, but the next traced
instruction will execute with IR|DR=0. This happens at the rfid at the
end of __enter_rtas, for instance.

So ppc_radix64_get_phys_page_debug will check the MSR, see that we are
(now) not in real mode and proceed with the page table walk, which could
fail.

In the particular case of the __enter_rtas rfid, we have PIDR=1 [1] so
if we don't exit ppc_radix64_get_phys_page_debug at the msr_dr == 0
check, it will fail to translate the address.

The reason I'm tracking the translation state here is to be able to tell
what will be the value of AIL, since an Alternate Interrupt Location is
not used when translation is disabled. In the ISA, under "Alternate
Interrupt Location" the only mention of MSR_IR != MSR_DR is:

"Other interrupts that occur when MSR IR=0 or MSR DR=0, are taken as
if LPCR AIL=0."

and my interpretation of that text is that AIL value is 0 when IR DR are
either 0b00, 0b01 or 0b10.

So "for the purposes of AIL", I'm considering either IR=0 or DR=0 as
meaning MMU off.
