Can we delay it until after this series?  I.e., as long as it retains
the name =E2=80=9Cwritable=E2=80=9D, would pulling it up into BlockExportOp=
tions a
compatible change?

If so, then I suppose we could do it afterwards.  But I think it does
make the most sense to =E2=80=9Cjust=E2=80=9D do it as part of this series.

Yes.  Especially bad with tests.

That=E2=80=99s true.  With a pure design RFC, it=E2=80=99s often difficult =
to know even
the scope of the design until you=E2=80=99ve begun to write code.  So there=
=E2=80=99s a
danger of just writing a bunch of uncontroversial basic design stuff
because one has no idea of what may actually become problematic and
questionable. :/

Yeah, the functions themselves are clear.

Hm.  Perhaps software engineering just is actually difficult, and
there=E2=80=99s no way around it.

Trying sounds good.  Since there shouldn=E2=80=99t be consequences for the =
QMP
interface, we=E2=84=A2 can always try again later (i.e., when adding more e=
xport
types).
