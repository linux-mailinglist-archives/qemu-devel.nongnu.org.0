Huh?

bdrv_has_zero_init() currently returns 1 if a driver knows that creating=20
an image results in that image reading as 0.  That means it can return 1=20
even for non-zero images that were not just created.  Thus, that=20
interface has both false positives (returning 1 for a non-zero image if=20
the driver hard-codes it to 1) and false negatives (returning 0 for an=20
image that happens to read as zero).  The false negatives are less=20
important (if we don't know if the image is already zero, then zeroing=20
it again is a waste of time but not semantically wrong) than the false=20
positives (but as long as you don't rely on bdrv_has_zero_init() unless=20
you also know the image was just created, you are safely avoiding the=20
false positives).

And that's the whole point of my series to add a qcow2 persistent bit to=20
track whether an image has known-zero contents: qemu-img should not be=20
calling bdrv_has_zero_init(), since it is so finicky on what it means.

--target-is-zero turns into the behavior of 'skip a pre-zeroing pass'.=20
If the destination is already zero, then copying zeroes from the source=20
is a waste of time. If the destination is not already zero, then zeroes=20
from the source are not copied, and the destination will not be=20
identical to the source.  We then have a choice of whether=20
--target-is-zero is merely a way to tell qemu something that it couldn't=20
learn otherwise but still be as safe as possible (if we can quickly=20
prove the target has non-zero data, the user lied about it being already=20
zero, so fail the command, so add yet another option to bypass the=20
safety check), or whether it really is synonymous with 'only copy the=20
non-zero portions of the source, and if the destination was not all zero=20
the copy is not faithful but I meant for it to be that way'.
