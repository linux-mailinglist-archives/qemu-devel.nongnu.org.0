I don't mind, if it is not too much overhead on your side.

What I noticed on the QEMU community is:

- If a series reviewed the same day and is almost done except
  a single bugfix, it is OK to repost the same day, so the
  maintainer is likely to queue it directly.

- If there are various reviews, and you do gradual improvements,
  it is OK to repost every 3 days. Else reviewers tend to skip/
  postpone your series for later.

- Pinging for review before 1 week passed is stressing reviewers,
  except in case of critical security bug (CVE) or during freeze.

- Series with integrated test provided are usually reviewed first.

This might help:

If you rework a peripheral, you need to reset the Reviewed-by/Tested-by
tags. If you add new peripherals, you only need to reset these tags on
the SoC patch. I'm fine either way, I use git-backport-diff to see the
SoC changes easily:

What I do in that case is take the binary used for the test,
write a comment and push it in a stable branch to my own repo:
https://github.com/philmd/qemu-testing-blob/ and use the stable
url in the test.

We know QEMU emulation worked with this particular binary at some
point. We want to avoid regressions in QEMU, so let's keep testing
what we know worked. We don't want to track 2 bugs at a time (one
in the updated guest and one in QEMU).

Regards,

Phil.
