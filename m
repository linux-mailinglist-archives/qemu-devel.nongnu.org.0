Well I'm mostly wondering what we're expecting the user todo with this
information. Generally a log file containing warnings ends up turning
into a bug report. If we think it is important for users and/or mgmt
apps to be aware of this info, then it might be better to actually
put a field in the query-migrate stats to report if zero-copy is
being honoured or not, and just have a trace point in this location
instead.

With regards,
Daniel
