Except that it's not just 3/23 but also 8/23.  Which is why it was so much
easier to leave it separate for review.

I suppose this could be split and squashed, it you insist.  I don't see any
particular value in that though.

I don't understand what you're looking for.

Do you want a type called "rx62n" for the concrete cpu instance?
That seems to be contrary to every other device in our system.

I hope you're not suggesting that the command-line be "-cpu rx62n-rx-cpu".
That seems pointlessly verbose.

If we're going to change the way we do things, we should do that everywhere,
and not make things different for only one target.
