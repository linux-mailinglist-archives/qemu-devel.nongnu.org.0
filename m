Ouch ...

We are adding a subqueue by priority, right? (see later comments)

savevm_state_handler_remove()

search didn't find it O:-)

I think that it is better if you split the new function creation.  Make
commit easier to write O:-)

Why are you still maintaining the handlers QTAILQ?  Once here will not
be easier to just change handlers field to be an array
handlers[MIG_PRI_MAX] field, and adjust callers?

Changes are only inside this file.

The code to maintain the subqueue inside the other queue is just as
complex as chaning all the callers.  What do you think?

savevm_state_handler_insert() for instance becomes even easier, just a
QTALIQ_INSERT_TAIL() in the proper queue, right?


I agree with the idea of the patch.  Especially when you told us how bad
the performance of the current code is.

Out of curiosity, how many objects are we talking about?

Later, Juan.
