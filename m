On the host: readlink clang
clang-9

and guest:

ls: cannot read symbolic link 'clang': No such file or directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 May 30 02:21 clang

readlink clang

returns nothing.

Title:
  unable to read symlinks when mounting 9p filesystem with
  security_model=3Dmapped

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I am trying to use clang that is mounted from a 9p filesystem that has th=
e options =

   -fsdev local,id=3Dvirtfs3,path=3D/clang,security_model=3Dmapped-file -de=
vice virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=3Dvirtfs3,mount_tag=3Dclang

  clang has symlinks to clang-9. eg /clang/clang/bin/clang is a symlink
  that points to clang-9 in the current directory.

  the clang filesystem is on a bind mount point on /clang/clang on the
  host and this is mapped to the same place on the guest. If I have the
  same virtfs mount point with the security_model=3Dnone I don't have this
  problem.
