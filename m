Hi,

The v1 cover letter explained this series=E2=80=99s purpose:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-07/msg01290.html

The v2 cover letter explained the v2 changes:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-08/msg00921.html


The only changes in v3 are:
- Patches 12 and 13: Added notes to the commit messages why it=E2=80=99s =
OK to
                     not let the user choose which snapshots to drop

(I wanted to also address Eric=E2=80=99s idea of letting
QCowSnapshot.extra_data_size be always >=3D sizeof(QCowSnapshotExtraData)
and thus save the MAX(sizeof(extra), sn->extra_data_size) in
qcow2_write_snapshots(), but that doesn=E2=80=99t really work, because th=
en we
have no way of knowing later whether the image is compliant and thus
needs fixing or not.  He gave me an R-b anyway, so I guess it=E2=80=99s f=
ine.
O:-))

This series now has R-bs from Eric on all patches.  I=E2=80=99m only post=
ing it
because I felt a bit bad about just taking the series as-is and add the
commit notes to 12 and 13 while applying it.
(Also, maybe there is someone who saw me have a bit of discussion with
Eric and thus assumed I would definitely send a v3 that they could then
review.)
