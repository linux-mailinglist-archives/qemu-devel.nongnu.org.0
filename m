My vote is for the former, rather than for the latter. I fact, if I may
suggest, I would use some longer and stronger wording, just for the simple
reason that the warning is less likely to be ignored (as Zoltan, I think
rightfully, noted to potentially be quite frequent case in reality):

"We strongly recommend
out-of-tree builds. In future we might make the commands that currently do
an in-tree build automatically create and use a separate build directory
for you. Still, our recommentation is that you change all your build
procedures to use only out-of-tree builds as soon as it is possible for
you."

Regards,
Aleksandar
