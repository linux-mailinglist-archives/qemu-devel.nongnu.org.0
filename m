At least most of the hunks could be dropped - we should likely keep the
one for the job that runs additional iotests (i.e.
"build-tcg-disabled"), since the block layers folks don't want to see
additional iotests as a blocker for pull requests (we've had a lengthy
discussion about this last summer...)

If we do not run "build-tcg-disabled" for PRs, then this job should not
be dropped, of course.
