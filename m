Public bug reported:

I have some code which passes my test suite on PPC64LE hardware when
compiled with GCC 10, but the saem binary fails with both qemu-ppc64le
4.2 (on Fedora 32) and qemu-ppc64le-static 5.0.0 (Debian testing).

I'm not getting any errors about illegal instructions or anything, like
that; the results are just silently different on qemu.

I've generated a reduced test case, which is attached along with the
binaries (both are the same code, one is just statically linked).  They
should execute successufully on PPC64LE hardware, but on qemu they hit a
__builtin_abort (because the computed value doesn't match the expected
value).

Without being familiar with PPC assembly I'm not sure what else I can
do, but if there is anything please let me know.
