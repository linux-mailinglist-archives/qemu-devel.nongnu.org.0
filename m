 a CPU looks like"). Not to talk about QEMU versions in addition to that. S=

ment, but not in a z/VM environment (you would have to disable features).

Maybe IBM wants to look into creating versions for all the old models we ha=
d. But again, not sure if that is of any help for s390x. CCing IBM.

Exactly.  oVirt, specifically, don't use host-model.

When -noTSX happened, we thought it was a corner case.  Then we
had -IBRS & -IBPB.  Then we had SSBD (with no new CPU models).
Then we had MD_CLEAR (with no new CPU models).  It's now very
easy to get an insecure VM created if you are not using
host-model.
