Likely I did not know how this function works when implementing it and may 
have used it wrong but none of the reviews spotted it either. (I may have 
used some other DMA device model as an inspiration but don't remember 
which.)

When can that happen? If only in cases when guest gives invalid parameters 
then maybe we don't have to bother with that and can let it fail but 
having a fallback does not hurt.

To my knowledge only AmigaOS needs it but that does use it and it boots 
and runs so this is not completely broken but maybe mapping random length 
memory areas could cause some problems if the length mapped is less than 
needed. I've seen random crashes with AmigaOS before that I could not 
explain but that seems to be related to processor speed (happens more on 
slower host) so it seems more like a race condition not wrong DMA and 
haven't seen it recently.

Those did boot before (may take a while due to bitbanging i2c driver in 
guest taking time to read RTC) but haven't checked for a while. It could 
be some changes in AROS broke it or some recent change in QEMU. I'll test 
these later when I'll have some time.

I remember I've found some info on this in some similar SoC that had docs 
on-line but don't remember which. Maybe 440EPx/GPx or something like that. 
It may not be the same but seems similar enough for AmigaOS to work. I 
think the two main sources were PPC440EPx/GRx Embedded Processor User's 
Manual and NXP/Freescale Application Note AN2661 Software Migration from 
the IBM (AMCC) 440GP to the MPC8540 which seem to be similar to 460EX and 
have some info on the DMA controller registers.

The emulation is only partial, I were only concerned about the parts 
AmigaOS uses so it may be some things are off. The docs above talk about 
some increment bits so this may be settable but I did not read the whole 
docs again and don't remember anything about it now. Probably AmigaOS does 
not use it so I did not implement that.

I was going to test the first rc with all OSes I have on sam460ex and 
pegasos2 but maybe I'll try to do it this week then.
