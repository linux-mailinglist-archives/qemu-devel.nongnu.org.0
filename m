I like the idea of sticking close to VFIO too.  The first step is
figuring out whether VFIO can be mapped to a UNIX domain socket protocol
and many non-VFIO protocol messages are required.  Hopefully that extra
non-VFIO stuff isn't too large.

If implementations can use the kernel uapi vfio header files then we're
on track for compatibility with VFIO.

That sounds good.
