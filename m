To get here, lookup_distinct() must have returned null.  It set an error
then.  Setting it again will crash.  Sure you tested this?

How can ov->repeated_opts be null in state LM_IN_PROGRESS?

ov->repeated_opts is initially null (state LM_NONE).  It becomes
non-null on transition to state LM_IN_PROGRESS in opts_start_list(), and
null on transition back to LM_NONE in opts_end_list().

Uh, now you're violating the invariant I just described.  I suspect
that's how null can happen now.

If the fix should change the invariant, we need to review the entire
file to make sure nothing that relies on the invariant remains.  The
!ov->repeated_opts check above takes care of one case.  There may be
more.  Before we search for them, let's have a closer look at the bug
you found.  I'll do that below.

This is another case.

Now let's step back and review what valgrind is telling us.

The invalid read is indeed a use after free.

The free is opts_next_list()'s g_hash_table_remove(ov->unprocessed_opts,
opt->name), which in turn calls destroy_list() to destroy the value
associated with opt->name.

The use is lookup_scalar()'s g_queue_peek_head(ov->repeated_opts).
We're in state LM_IN_PROGRESS.  ov->repeated_opts points to a value
freed by opts_next_list().

Happens when test_opts_range_beyond() tries to visit more list elements
than actually present.

ov->repeated_opts becomes dangling when opts_next_list() destroys
ov->unprocessed_opts on reaching the end of the list.  Your patch zaps
it right after it becomes dangling.  Good.

But now the state machine has a new state "visiting beyond end of list":
list_mode == LM_IN_PROGRESS, repeated_opts == NULL.

Perhaps giving it its own ListMode member would be clearer.

Regardless, we need to convince ourselves that we handle the new state
correctly everywhere.  Have you done that?
