This is all part of QEMU, and QEMU is licensed under the GPLv2. If
someone wants to use a less strict license for their own code that is
still compatible with the GPLv2, like the LGPLv2.1, that's fine. But I
think if Philippe does not like to release his code under the LGPL, and
wants to use GPL instead, you can not force him to use LGPL here. It's
the decision of Philippe what he wants to use for his code.
