My guess is that RFLAGS.ZF =3D=3D 1 and one or a few of the checks on VMX c=
ontrols have failed. So far I have verified the following checks (26-2 and =
26-3 in Intel SDM Vol. 3C):
* Reserved bits in Pin-based VM execution controls are set according to ass=
ociated capabilities MSR =

* Reserved bits in Primary Proc-based VM execution controls are set accordi=
ng to associated capabilities MSR =

* Reserved bits in Secondary Proc-based VM execution controls are set accor=
ding to associated capabilities MSR =

* CR-3 target count is not greater than 4. (the count is 0)
* Use I/O bitmaps check is not applicable because "use I/O bitmaps" VM-exec=
ution control is 0.
* Reserved bits in VM-exit controls are set according to associated capabil=
ities MSR =

* Reserved bits in VM-entry controls are set according to associated capabi=
lities MSR =


However, the MSR-bitmap Address check might fail:
"If the =E2=80=9Cuse MSR bitmaps=E2=80=9D VM-execution control is 1, bits 1=
1:0 of the MSR-bitmap address must be 0. The address should not set any bit=
s beyond the processor=E2=80=99s physical-address width."

Bit 28 in Pin-based VM execution controls is set to 1 while the MSR
address has bits 5:1 set to 1 (0x3f). There's no way to disable the "use
MSR bitmaps" execution control so I'll try to make a patch that sets 4k-
page aligned MSR bitmap address.

Updated log lines show the VMX capabilities for the control fields and VMCS=
 fields related to the failure:
