Sometime I do peel of the patches that are already ready and push
through the PR - especially if the stack is getting a bit too wobbly.
However as rc1 had already passed I just continued to collect them.

After all splitting them off is not cost free as I like to ensure my
final tag has a clean run through our CI as well as an overnight soak
through some of the longer tests ("make docker-test-build" & the vm
tests). Usually I tag at the end of the day and then send the PR the
next morning.

I'm about to post v3 of the series - I'll aim to tag it all Friday
evening or over the w/e and post the PR on Monday.
