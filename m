If the mptcp handshake fails by any means - e.g. one side does not ask
for MPTCP - the connection fallbacks to plain TCP in a transparent way.

Ouch!

So far is not supported. Both KTLS and MPTCP use/need ULP (Upper Layer
Protocol, a kernel way of hijaking core TCP features) and we can have a
single ULP per socket, so possibly that there is some technical show-
stopper there.

At very least is not in our short term roadmap, but I guess we can
updated that based on user needs.

Thanks!
