Defining semantics for an error register seems like a project on its
own.  We do have flags, we could use them to add an error register
later, but I think it's only going to rat hole this effort to try to
incorporate that now.  The state machine is fairly small, so in the
scenario you present, I think the user would assume a failure at
pre-copy to stop-and-copy transition would fail the migration and the
device could go back to running state.  If the device then fails to
return to the running state, we might be stuck with a device with
reduced performance or overhead and the user could warn about that and
continue with the device as-is.  The vendor drivers could make use of
-EAGAIN on transition failure to indicate a temporary issue, but
otherwise the user should probably consider it a persistent error until
either a device reset or start of a new migration sequence (ie. return
to running and start over).  Thanks,

Alex
