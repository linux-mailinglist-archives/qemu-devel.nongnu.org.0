qemu-mp has been cut down significantly in order to make it
non-invasive.  The model is now much cleaner:
1. No monitor command or command-line option forwarding.  The device
   emulation program has its own command-line and monitor that QEMU
   doesn't know about.
2. No per-device proxy objects.  A single RemotePCIDevice is added to
   QEMU.  In the current patch series it only supports the LSI SCSI
   controller but once the socket protocol is changed to
   vfio-over-socket it will be possible to use any PCI device.

We recently agreed on dropping live migration to further reduce the
patch series.  If you have specific suggestions, please post reviews on
the latest patch series.

The RemotePCIDevice and device emulation program infrastructure it puts
in place are intended to be used by vfio-over-socket in the future.  I
see it as complementary to vfio-over-socket rather than as a
replacement.  Elena, Jag, and JJ have been working on it for a long time
and I think we should build on top of it (replacing parts as needed)
rather than propose a new plan that sidelines their work.

I think JJ has been working on this already.  Not sure what the status
is.

This is similar to the qemu-mp approach.  I think they found that doing
this in practice requires a RemotePCIBus and a
RemoteInterruptController.  Something along these lines:

  qemu -machine none \
       -chardev socket=3Dfoo,server \
       -device remote-pci-bus,chardev=3Dfoo \
       -device pci-serial # added to the remote-pci-bus

PCI devices you want to instantiate are completely unmodified - no need
to even add a vfio=3D parameter.  They just happen to be on a RemotePCIBus
instead of a regular PCI bus.  That way they can be accessed via
vfio-over-socket and interrupts are also handled remotely.
