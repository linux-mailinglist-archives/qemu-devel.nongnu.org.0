There's a difference for a backing file larger than the qcow2 file, and=20
the protocol layer larger than the qcow2 file.  Visually, with the=20
following four nodes:

f1 [qcow2 format] <- f2 [qcow2 format]
   v                        v
p1 [file protocol]    p2 [file protocol]

If f1 is larger than f2, then resizing f2 without writing zero clusters=20
leaks the data from f1 into f2.  The block layer knows this: prior to=20
this series, bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate() returns 0 if bs->backing is=20
present; and even in this series, see patch 6/17 which continues to=20
force a 0 return rather than calling into the driver if the sizes are=20
suspect.  But that is an uncommon corner case; in short, the qcow2=20
callback .bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate is NOT reachable in that scenario,=20
whether before or after this series.

On the other hand, if p2 is larger than f2, resizing f2 reads zeroes.=20
That's because qcow2 HAS to add L2 mappings into p2 before data from p2=20
can leak, but .bdrv_co_truncate(PREALLOC_MODE_OFF) does not add any L2=20
mappings.  Thus, qcow2 blindly returning 1 for=20
.bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate was correct (other than the anomaly of=20
bs->encrypted, also fixed earlier in this series).
