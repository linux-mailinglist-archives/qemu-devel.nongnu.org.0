FWIW, libvirt treats it as mandatory for query-iothreads, but optional
for query-cpus because it was missing in some older QEMU versions
entirely.

Libvirt explicitly only supports macOS, Linux and FreeBSD, so if those
platforms all report a value, libvirt won't care if you make it optional
and omit it for other platforms.
