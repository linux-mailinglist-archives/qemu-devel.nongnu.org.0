2 years back I proposed dropping the sheepdog mailing list from the=0D
MAINTAINERS file, but somehow the patch never got picked up:=0D
=0D
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2018-03/msg01048.html=0D
=0D
So here I am with the same patch again.=0D
=0D
I further looked at the sheepdog project though, and I'm wondering=0D
if we actually want to keep the sheepdog storage driver at all.=0D
=0D
This thread from a little over a year ago:=0D
=0D
  http://lists.wpkg.org/pipermail/sheepdog/2019-March/thread.html=0D
=0D
clearly states that sheepdog is no longer actively developed. The only=0D
mentioned users are some companies who are said to have it for legacy=0D
reasons with plans to replace it by Ceph. There is talk about cutting=0D
out existing features to turn it into a simple demo of how to write a=0D
distributed block service. There is no evidence of anyone working on=0D
that idea.=0D
=0D
  https://github.com/sheepdog/sheepdog/commits/master=0D
=0D
No real commits to git since Jan 2018 and that's just dealing with=0D
technical debt.=0D
=0D
There is essentially no activity on the mailing list aside from=0D
patches to QEMU that get CC'd due to our MAINTAINERS entry, if and=0D
when someone processes the moderator queue.=0D
=0D
Fedora packages for sheepdog failed to build from upstream source=0D
because of the more strict linker that no longer merges duplicate=0D
global symbols. So we patch it to add the missing "extern" annotations.=0D
Upstream source remains broken for everyone else.=0D
=0D
AFAIK, none of our containers or VMs include the sheepdog server=0D
packages, so we have no testing coverage for it in CI that I see.=0D
=0D
Does someone have a compelling reason for QEMU to keep supporting=0D
this driver, other than the fact that it already exists ?=0D
=0D
If not, it looks like a candidate for deprecating in QEMU with a=0D
view to later removing it.=0D
