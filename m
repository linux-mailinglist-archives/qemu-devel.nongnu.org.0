Hello Max,

I made the mistake of reproducing this on my home system using the qemu rev=
ision that I had and assuming it's caused by a used port. So I limited the =
port range and used nc to occupy the port. It sort-of reproduced but instea=
d of Address already in use it hanged until I kill the nc process. Then it =
failed with:

+Traceback (most recent call last):
+  File "147", line 124, in test_inet
+    flatten_sock_addr(address))
+  File "147", line 59, in client_test

+AssertionError: failed path traversal for "return" in "{'error': {'class':=
 'GenericError', 'desc': 'Failed to read initial magic: Unexpected end-of-f=
ile before all bytes were read'}}"

After a brief study I thought qemu is not doing the job well enough and wan=
ted to add a protection. Anyway after a more thorough overview I came to a =
different conclusion and that is that we are facing the same issue as with =
incoming migration about a year ago. What happened is that I started "nc -l=
 localhost 32789" which results in:

COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
nc      26758 medic    3u  IPv6 9579487      0t0  TCP localhost:32789 (LIST=
EN)

Then we start the server by "_try_server_up" where qemu-nbd detects the por=
t is occupied on IPv6 but available on IPv4, so it claims it:
COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
nc        26758 medic    3u  IPv6 9579487      0t0  TCP localhost:32789 (LI=
STEN)
qemu-nbd  26927 medic    4u  IPv4 9591857      0t0  TCP localhost:32789 (LI=
STEN)

and reports success. Then we try to connect but the hotplugged VM first att=
empts to connect on the IPv6 address and hangs for infinity.

Now is this an expected behavior? If so then we need the find_free_address =
(but preferably directly in _try_server_up just before starting the qemu-nb=
d) to leave as little time-frame for collision as possible. Otherwise the t=
est is alright and qemu-nbd needs a fix to bail out in case some address is=
 already used (IIRC this is what incoming migration does).


My second mistake was testing this on the old code-base and rebasing it onl=
y before sending the patch (without testing after the rebase). If I were to=
 test it first, I would have found out that the real reproducer is simply r=
unning the test as the commit 8dff69b9415b4287e900358744b732195e1ab2e2 brok=
e it.


So basically there are 2 actions:

1. fix the test as on my system it fails in 100% of cases, bisect says the =
first bad commit is 8dff69b9415b4287e900358744b732195e1ab2e2. Would anyone =
have time in digging into this? I already spent way too much time on this a=
nd don't really know what that commit is trying to do.
2. decide on the behavior when IPv4/6 is already in use (bail-out or start)=
.
2a. In case it should bail-out than the test is correct and there is no nee=
d for my patch. On the other hand qemu-nbd has to be fixed
2b. Otherwise I can send a v2 that will check the port in the _try_server_u=
p just before starting qemu-nbd to minimize the risk of using a utilized po=
rt (or should you decide it's not worth checking, I can simply forget about=
 this)

Regards,
Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1
