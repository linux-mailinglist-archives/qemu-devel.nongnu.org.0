FWIW, I think moving the QEMU infrastructure zoo to GitLab is a very
good idea!

Daniel already mentioned most of the things that I had in mind after
reading your mail (well, actually he mentioned way more things that I
had in mind), but let me add some sentences below anyway...

Having done some clean-up work in the QEMU wiki in the past already, I
can only agree with Daniel. I don't think that we want a 1:1 conversion
of the existing Wiki, we should rather start from scratch and only
convert the important pages. Or should we really keep stuff like
https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/KQemu around?

Maybe we should also rather convert the important content into parts of
the main website instead, just like Daniel mentioned it.

Whichever way we choose, I volunteer to help here if my spare time permits.

+1000 !

I was already thinking of suggesting to move the bug tracker to either
gitlab or github or anywhere else during next KVM forum, since it is
IMHO a real pain.

I've seen so many bugs that users tried to open against the downstream
Ubuntu QEMU package but ended up in the upstream tracker instead. Apart
from that, the Launchpad UI is partly really horrible in my eyes (for
example you never know which action will trigger an immediate change and
which needs to be confirmed by pressing a button). Additional many
developers don't have a Launchpad account, so bugs can not be assigned
properly and you just have to pray that people see the notification
e-mails on the mailing list.

I think we could set most (outdated) bugs simply to "incomplete" with a
message saying that the reporter should open a new bug on Gitlab if
necessary. Then after 60 days, the "incomplete" bugs will expire (i.e.
auto-close).
