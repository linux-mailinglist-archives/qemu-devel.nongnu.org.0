Hi,

Kevin commented on my RFC, so I got what an RFC wants, and he didn=E2=80=99=
t
object to the creation fallback part.  So I suppose I can go down that
route at least.  (Which was actually the more important part of the
series.)

So as in the RFC, this series adds a fallback path for creating files
(on the protocol layer) if the protocol driver does not support file
creation, but the file already exists.


v1 (as compared to the RFC):
- Changed patch 1 to match Kevin=E2=80=99s proposal
- Added patches 2 and 3 to replace the truncation fallback
- Changed patch 4 accordingly
- Added patches 5 and 6
- Truncated patch 7 (haha!), because there no longer is a truncation
  fallback, so we cannot test it.

I would like to note that the diff stat without patches 1 and 7 is
141+, 139-.  So this series is basically a net zero for our code size,
but it prevents future series that might add such pseudo-creation
support to other drivers but file-posix (for host devices) and iscsi
(e.g. I=E2=80=99m looking at you, nvme).
