I read this first:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-05/msg00472.html

Which makes sense to me.  From OOB POV, IMHO it's fine, because as
Markus pointed out that we only call emit() after the json
parser/streamer, so IIUC it should not be affected on how much we read
from the chardev frontend each time.

But from my understanding what Markus suggested has nothing to do with
the currently introduced ring buffer.  Also, from what I read above I
still didn't find anywhere that explained on why we need a ring buffer
(or I must have missed it).

Thanks,
