should_be_hidden is a mechanism for implementing
realize-without-plug: kind of. It's a mechanism that ensures
qdev_device_add() returns early as long as the condition to hide the
device is true. You could to the realize-without-plug in the handler
function that decides if the device should be "hidden". =20

partially_hotplugged is a mechanism for implementing
unplug-without-unrealize: yes.=20
