If it were breaking migration stream or guest ABI,
I'd agree with you but it isn't.

So in this case, it's a bug that qemu wasn't checking
size for alignment and making workaround to keep the bug
around looks wrong to me.
It is fixable on user side (one has to fix VM's config),
so it should be fixed there and not in QEMU.
And any automatic tooling that generates invalid size
should be fixed as well. 
(I think it's not QEMU's job to mask users errors and
doing something that user not asked for)
