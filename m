Yes, but IIRC, there was a bit of a philisophical debate about the
value of FIPS and whether QEMU was going to accept it at all upstream.
I think the -enablefips switch was a compromise to get something
upstream.

It isn't so much "no passwords", rather in the VNC case the rule
we fal on is "no single DES" encryption algorithm !

Back when we added FIPS in QEMU, VNC was using the built-in DES
impl, and hence we needed to block this explicitly ourselves.

These days a sensible QEMU build will link to a crypto library
and get DES from there.  This crypto library will in turn block
our use of single DES when in FIPS mode, so QEMU won't have to
worry about it.

I don't think it is about passwords. Encryption algorithms were the
really key thing AFAIK, and the intent is that by using a common crypto
library you get the FIPS support for free.
