What about non-device users such as block jobs or (NBD) exports? Won't
they have to special-case such devices, too? In fact, what about image
format drivers or even filters?

I feel that this needs to be managed at the BDS level somehow. Not sure
which mechanism to use, though. Permissions would be suitable for a
blacklist approach, but I agree with you that we need a whitelist
instead.

Hm... Actually, file-posix implements .bdrv_check_perm and could just
refuse attaching a parent there if it doesn't request a specific
permission like BLK_PERM_SUPPORT_ZONED. That should give us the
whitelist semantics through existing infrastructure.
