"Owning" as in it only works (doesn't hang) when bdrv_flush_co_entry 
runs on the same AioContext that the BlockDriverState it's flushing 
belongs to.

We hold the locks for all AioContexts we want to flush in our code (in 
this case called from do_vm_stop/bdrv_flush_all so we're even in a 
drained section).

Thanks for taking a look!
