This is an interesting point actually. And while the implementation of
the post-copy style live snapshotting is for a different conversation, I
think the implications it has on the API are relevant for us now.

But even if we have an all-in-one snapshot job instead of a transaction
to group all the individual operations together, I think you could still
represent that by just specifying an empty list of nodes to be
snapshotted. (I feel this is another argument for passing the nodes to
include rather than nodes to exclude from the disk snapshot.)
