The client may have been freed already by a secondary audio device
recovering its session as JACK2 has some cleanup code to work around
broken clients, which doesn't account for well behaved clients.

https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues/627

As JACK1 and JACK2 are interchangeable and JACK2 has "cleanup" routine
that JACK1 does not have, we need to determine which version is in use
at runtime. Unfortunatly there is no way to determine which is in use
other then to look for symbols that are missing in JACK1, which in this
case is `jack_get_version`.

An issue has been raised over this, but to be compatible with older
versions we must use this method to determine which library is in use.
If at some time the jack developers implement `jack_get_version` in
JACK1, this code will need to be revisited.

At worst the workaround will be enabled and this will introduce a small
memory leak if the jack server is restarted. This however is better then
the alternative which would be a use after free segfault.
