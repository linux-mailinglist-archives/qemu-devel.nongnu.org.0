Well not all VMMs support migration, and it's only migration that is 
affected by this for a simple VMM (e.g. the changes to kvmtool are 
minimal for MTE). But yes fundamentally if a VMM enables MTE it needs to 
know how to deal with the extra tags everywhere.

I'm happy to change it, if you feel this is easier to debug.

Sounds good. My hope was that the abstractions were already in there.
