No need to be offending, and especially no need to insult St=E9phane in QEM=
U=20
code.

Could you please describe in more detail how you ran into this situation wi=
th=20
your 2nd audio device?

Are you aware that there are two distinct variants of JACK? They are common=
ly=20
referred to as JACK1 vs. JACK2 and despite their names, they are in fact=20
completely separate implementations and there are people who prefer one ove=
r=20
the other. Your change would affect JACK1 as well.

Best regards,
