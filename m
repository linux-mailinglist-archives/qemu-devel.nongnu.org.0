This was the most critical reason why we have this code in libvirt
in the first place.

NB, we need to be sure we are comparing the same things between
libvirt and QEMU when we discuss "probing".

What we're talking about by probing in libvirt context is

  - Detect the image format
  - Detect the image virtual size
  - Detect the image physical size
  - Detect the image backing store location
  - Detect the image backing store format
  - Detect the image encryption usage

In QEMU 'format probing' (as impl by bdrv_probe in QEMU's block layer)
only covers the very first point, 'detect the image format'. All the
other information can only be acquired by opening the image (bdrv_open
in QEMU's block layer).

The issue is that bdrv_open does waaaaaay more than we desire here,
because it is serving the broader purpose of allowing QEMU to actually
use the image. qcow2 is probably the worst case example, as it has
to parse the image and setup data structures for l1, l2 tables,
refcount tables, snapshots, and initialize the encryption layer if
present.

It is known that this code is vulnerable to maliciously created
qcow2 images. This resulted in OpenStack being vulnerable to
CVE-2015-5162 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1449062

It isn't possible to do anything to avoid this risk if you are
invoking qemu-img on untrustworthy images. The best you can do
is to mitigate the effects by placing memory/CPU ulimits on
the qemu-img process. Determining these limits then introduces
a new problem, as you have to pick a limit which is low enough
to avoid DoS, while large enough to allow all valid usage.

Since mitigating CVE-2015-5162 OpenStack has faced this problem
with users reporting that the limits it set were breaking valid
usage, as so had to increase the limits, which increases the
DoS impact.  Then there's also the pain that OSP suffered when
QEMU introduced mandatory locking which broke all existing
usage of 'qemu-img info' when a VM was running.

Of course when you launch QEMU later, it is susceptible to the
DoS in the system emulator, but this is mitigated by fact that
upfront probing is going to reject some malicious images. If
some bad images do get past, then it will be dealt with by the
mgmt apps normal monitoring of a running VM resource usage
and/or cgroups limits.

The libvirt probing code is designed to do the minimal work
needed to get the information we require. Of course there may
be bugs in libvirt's code, but it is much more straightforward
for us to analyse & understand risks, as most of the problematic
code that QEMU has simply doesn't exist in libvirt.

>  - performance of spawning extra processes would be way worse

Yes, this was the second motivation for having this code in libvirt
originally. The QEMU VM startup case wasn't the target, but rather
storage pools code. When we start a storage pool with 100's of images,
the time to spawn 100's of instances of qemu-img adds up very quickly.
Even if qemu-img had exactly the same minimalist code as libvirt's
current probing logic it would still be worse. The overhead of process
startup vs the time spent probing the image is a poor ratio, such that
process startup/exec time dominates.


The third reason why libvirt has this code is because historically
the error reporting from qemu-img has been quite unhelpful - many
errors just end up being a generic EINVAL error message. Things have
improved over time, but error reporting is always a challenge when
spawning external commands to do work.


The fourth reason why libvirt has this image file detection code is
that it is used by non-QEMU drivers in libvirt, mostly notably the
storage pool driver, and we didn't wish to force people to install
qemu-img on hosts which were not running the QEMU virt driver.
I don't think this reason is especially a technical show stopper,
since these days all distros allow you to install qemu-img, without
pulling in the rest of QEMU. In fact the storage pool driver RPM
depends on qemu-img explicitly since we dropped support for the
Xen tools for image creation a while ago.



There is scope for something to replace the current libvirt probing
code, but spawning 'qemu-img info' is certainly not that something.

Libvirt (and apps above libvirt in general) would really benefit from
having a library that they can use for readonly querying of information
about disk images. Of course that library can't just spawn qemu-img
otherwise that defeats the point of using a library.

Unfortunately QEMU's block layer can't practically serve this role
because its GPLv2-only licensing is too restrictive for some apps
needs.=20

It would have to be something conceptually similar in complexity to
what libvirt's current probing code does, so that we can have good
confidence in its behaviour in the face of malicious input.

So the key problem we have is that with -blockdev we are always explicitly
telling QEMU what the backing file is for every image.

Can we fix this to have the exact same behaviour as before by *not* telling
QEMU anything about the backing file when using -blockdev, if there is no
well defined backing format present. ie, use -blockdev, but let QEMU probe
just as it did in non-blockdev days.

Would there be any downsides to this that did not already exist in the
non-blockdev days ?

I don't think we can solve the regressions in behaviour of backing files
by doing probing of the backing files in libvirt, because that only works
for the case where libvirt can actually open the file. ie a local file on
disk. We don't have logic for opening backing files on RBD, GlusterFS,
iSCSI, HTTP, SSH, etc, and nor do we want todo that.

So to me it looks like the only viable option is to not specify the
backing file info to QEMU at all.

Yeah, this is a really bad situation given the difficulty in safely
using qemu-img, without also breaking valid usage.

We don't want to push this off to apps

I feel like the risk of image corruption is pretty minor. Our probing
handles all normal cases the same way as QEMU and newly introduced
image formats are rare.
