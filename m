Wow. That makes it sound like we should NOT attempt 
fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE) on the fast path, because we don't have 
guarantees that it is fast.

I really wish the kernel would give us 
fallocate(FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE|FALLOC_FL_NO_FALLBACK) which would fail 
fast rather than doing a flush or other slow fallback.

It also goes to show us that the kernel does NOT yet give us enough 
fine-grained control over what we really want (which is: 'pre-zero this 
if it is fast, but don't waste time if it is not).  Most of the kernel 
interfaces end up being 'pre-zero this, and it might be fast, fail fast, 
or even fall back to something safe but slow, and you can't tell the 
difference short of trying'.
