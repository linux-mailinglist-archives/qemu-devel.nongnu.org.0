Maybe simply fix loadvm_postcopy_handle_run() to set the state after
the POSTCOPY_INCOMING_LISTENING check?

It is true that we might hang on some real errors, but IMHO it might
be no where better to quit QEMU if we're in postcopy...

(What I'm thinking in mind here is that sometimes even if postcopy
 failed we might still have a chance to recover a full VM by dumping
 both src/dst of the during-postcopy VM instances and manually merge
 them by black magic, in very extreme cases)
