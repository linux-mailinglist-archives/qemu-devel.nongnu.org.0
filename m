That would require at least a callback at machine level, 
also practice shows warnings are of no use.

If someone insist on using wrong size with new QEMU, one can write a wrapper
script to workaround the issue (if they don't wish to fix configs/tooling).
I don't like keeping hacks to fix user mistakes in QEMU and on top of that
adding infrastructure for that (QEMU is already too much complicated).
Since in this case it break migration only partially, it's sufficient
to print error message that suggest correct size to use (like it's been done
for other boards, s390 is the last remaining that is doing ram_size fixups).
That way user could fix config and restart migration.
