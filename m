Agree.

"Return such-and-such when..." is just as correct: imperative mood.  I
prefer imperative mood for function contracts.

Sounds useful, but yes, it's clearly outside QEMU context.

How would you mark up variable names in doc strings?  Often, their
"variableness" is obvious from context, but not always.  In C comments,
we tend to use @var [*].

[*] GTK-Doc says @var is just for parameters, but since it offers
nothing for variables, we sometimes use it for variables as well.
