Hi Heyi,

Apologies for having forgotten about that thread. I recall now having
followed it last March. Indeed it even addresses the issue in the way
we're coming around to now (save/restore vs. update with virtual time).

I just reread the whole thread, and my feeling is that, while there are
still many issues left to work, until we get a pvclock for arm, a patch
like this one, but with a way to opt-in/out in order to give users a
chance to choose their poison, is the best we can do. Also a patch like
this one is a step in the right direction, as it will be needed as part
of the bigger pvclock solution eventually, just as it is for x86.

One comment on the patch is that I would prefer to do the save/restore
for all VCPUs, even though KVM does currently handle synchronization.
Not only does it "feel" more correct to apply VCPU APIs to all VCPUs,
but I assume it will be less problematic to implement CPU hotplug at
some point.

Thanks,
drew
