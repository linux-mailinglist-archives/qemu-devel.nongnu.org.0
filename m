I'm also wondering if 'nbd-server-add' should add support to expose a=20
'qemu:allocation:XXX' meta context, in addition to the existing=20
'qemu:dirty-bitmap:XXX' contexts (would it just be a 0/1 bit for what is=20
allocated in block layer XXX, or would it be an integer depth 0,1,2,...=20
based on how deep in the chain a cluster is allocated, or?)

It may also be interesting to have a way to have 'nbd-server-add' force=20
EIO errors to reads from an area not covered by a bitmap (whether that=20
be the dirty bitmap or the #ALLOCATED bitmap), rather than falling back=20
to a read from the backing chain, to ensure that an NBD client using=20
such a backup image cannot read any more data than what the bitmap says=20
is available.

If nothing else, the recent addition of introspectible QMP features=20
should make this possible.
