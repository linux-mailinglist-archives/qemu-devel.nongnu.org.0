Thanks! Saw it, looks fine now.

So in other words you are only going to test the default behaviour
--multidevs=warn?

If yes, and since that would mean I was the only person ever having tested the 
actual fix, shouldn't --multidevs=remap|forbid better be marked as 
experimental (docs and runtime warning) for now? Maybe that would also 
anticipate receiving feedback from people actually using it later on.

Well, that website is far from being too verbose of what that test suite

I see. Well, I will look at it, but that will definitely not be one of my 
current high priority tasks that would happen in the next few weeks (simply 
due to my work load).
