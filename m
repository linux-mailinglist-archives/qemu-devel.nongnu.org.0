I got that now, so let's talk state.

A keyslot can be either inactive or active.

Let's start low-level, i.e. we specify the slot by slot#:

    state       new state   action
    inactive    inactive    nop
    inactive    active      put secret, iter-time, mark active
    active      inactive    mark inactive (effectively deletes secret)
    active      active      in general, error (unsafe update in place)
                            we can make it a nop when secret, iter-time
                                remain unchanged
                            we can allow unsafe update with force: true

As struct:

    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotUpdate',
      'data': { 'active': 'bool',       # could do enum instead
                'keyslot': 'int',
                '*secret': 'str',       # present if @active is true
                '*iter-time': 'int' } } # absent if @active is false

As union:

    { 'enum': 'LUKSKeyslotState',
      'data': [ 'active', 'inactive' ] }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotActive',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                '*iter-time': 'int } }
    { 'union': 'LUKSKeyslotAmend',
      'base': { 'state': 'LUKSKeyslotState' }   # must do enum
      'discriminator': 'state',
      'data': { 'active': 'LUKSKeyslotActive' } }

When we don't specify the slot#, then "new state active" selects an
inactive slot (chosen by the system, and "new state inactive selects
slots by secret (commonly just one slot).

New state active:

    state       new state   action
    inactive    active      put secret, iter-time, mark active
    active      active      N/A (system choses inactive slot)

New state inactive, for each slot holding the specified secret:

    state       new state   action
    inactive    inactive    N/A (inactive slot holds no secret)
    active      inactive    mark inactive (effectively deletes secret)

As struct:

    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotUpdate',
      'data': { 'active': 'bool',       # could do enum instead
                '*keyslot': 'int',
                '*secret': 'str',       # present if @active is true
                '*iter-time': 'int' } } # absent if @active is false

As union:

    { 'enum': 'LUKSKeyslotState',
      'data': [ 'active', 'inactive' ] }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotActive',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                '*iter-time': 'int } }
    { 'union': 'LUKSKeyslotAmend',
      'base': { '*keyslot': 'int',
                'state': 'LUKSKeyslotState' }
      'discriminator': 'state',
      'data': { 'active': 'LUKSKeyslotActive' } }

Union looks more complicated because our union notation sucks[*].  I
like it anyway, because you don't have to explain when which optional
members aren't actually optional.

Regardless of struct vs. union, this supports an active -> active
transition only with an explicit keyslot.  Feels fine to me.  If we want
to support it without keyslot as well, we need a way to specify both old
and new secret.  Do we?


[*] I hope to fix that one day.  It's not even hard.
