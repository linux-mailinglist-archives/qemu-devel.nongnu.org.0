Sorry for catching up late, this mail thread happened during my PTO.

I remember bringing up at the time [1] that the correct solution needs
to take into account usage models that vary from

- a workstation case, where displaying an error box is easy and
  convenient,

- to local headless VMs where system-level notification would do the job
  better, allowing us to leverage things like system-wide email notifications

- to large-scale collections of VMs managed by some layered product,
  where the correct reporting would be through something like Insights,
  i.e. you don't scan individual logs, you want something like "913 VMs
  are using deprecated X"

To me, that implies that we need to have a clear division of roles, with
a standard way to

a) produce the errors,
b) propagate them,
c) consume them (at least up to libvirt)

Notice that this work has already been done for "real" errors,
i.e. there is a real QAPI notion of "errors". AFAICT, warn_report does
not connect to it, though, it goes through error_vprintf which is really
just basic logging.

So would it make sense to:

1. Add a deprecation_report() alongside warn_report()?

2. Connect warn_report() and all the error_vprintf output to QAPI,
   e.g. using John's suggestion of adding the messages using some
   "warning" or "deprecated" tag?

3. Teach libvirt how to consume that new tag and pass it along?
