Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64 does not boot image reliably

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Booting image as root user with following command works randomly.

  ./qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -curses -smp cpus=3D4 -m 8192
  /root/ructfe2917_g.qcow2

  Most of the time it ends up on "800x600 Graphic mode"(been stuck there
  even for 4 hours before killed), but 1 out of ~20 it boots image
  correctly(and instantly).

  This is visible in v2.5.0 build from sources, v2.5.0 from Ubuntu
  Xenial and v2.1.2 from Debian Jessie.

  The image in question was converted from vmdk using:

  qemu-img convert -O qcow2 file.vmdk file.qcow2

  The image contains Ubuntu with grub.

  I can provide debug logs, but will need guidance how to enable
  them(and what logs are necessary).

  As a side note, it seems that booting is more certain after
  connecting(or mounting) partition using qemu-nbd/mount.
