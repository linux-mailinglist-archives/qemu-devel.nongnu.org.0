So IIUC, you're saying that for x86 gating, the intention is to use shared
runners in general.

Your current work that you say is blocked on access to x86 hardware, is jus=
t
about demonstrating the concept of plugging in custom runners, while we wai=
t
for access to non-x86 hardware ?

It occurred to me that we could do this if we grant selective access to
the Gitlab repos, to people who are official subsystem maintainers.
GitLab has a concept of "protected branches", so you can control who is
allowed to push changes on a per-branch granularity.

So, for example, in the main qemu.git, we could create branches for each
subsystem tree eg

  staging-block
  staging-qapi
  staging-crypto
  staging-migration
  ....

and for each of these branches, we can grant access to relevant subsystem
maintainer(s).

When they're ready to send a pull request to Peter, they can push their
tree to this branch. Since the branch is in the main gitlab.com/qemu/qemu
project namespace, this branch can run CI using the private QEMU runners.
The subsystem maintainer can thus see the full set of CI results across
all platforms required by Gating, before Peter even gets the pull request.

So when Peter then looks at merging the pull request to master, the only
he's likely to see are the non-deterministic bugs, or issues caused by
semantic conflicts with other recently merged code.

It would even be possible to do the final merge into master entirely from
GitLab, no need to go via email. When the source branch & target branch are
within the same git repo, GitLab has the ability to run CI jobs against the
resulting merge commit in a strict gating manner, before it hits master.
They call this "Merge trains" in their documentation.

IOW, from Peter's POV, merging pull requests could be as simple as hitting
the merge button in GitLab merge request UI. Everything wrt CI would be
completely automated, and the subsystem maintainers would have the
responsibility to dealing with merge conflicts & CI failures, which is
more scalable for the person co-ordinating the merges into master.

Daniel
