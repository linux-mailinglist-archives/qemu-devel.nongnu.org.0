I am with you, Peter, and I truly appreciate your repeating that for the
second time.

But, what made me upset, obviously not everybody is reading your
statements. If you really carefully read responses to the original thread
started by you and also subsequent threads, you'll see that a number of
suggestions either cripple or outrightly effectively remove in-tree builds!
And all that not in 4 months, not in 8 months, but now, in the same patch
that was discussed (maybe the authors meant "later", but certainly did not
write that).

(on closer examination, perhaps Eric's proposal does not belong to this
catehory, so my apologies to Eric)

I unfortunately can't, because I am working from home, and having
difficulties accessing my dev system with said behavior, that I left at the
company. If and when these difficulties disappear, I will gladly and
certainly send a bug report.

I meant to say the scenario you mention in your original thread on the same
topic from the other day, and perhaps you said "Coverity", and not
"coccinele" - and I mixed up the two.

So, in other words, nothing new, I was just echoing what you said before,
the other day, in a response to one of my messages.

Regards,
Aleksandar
