That's the VMware PV interface... I didn't design it. :P
Regarding how it handles the fact time is not monotonic across 
migrations, see big comment at the start of 
services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c in open-vm-tools regarding the 
time-sync algorithm used by VMware Tools.
Specifically:
"""
During normal operation this plugin only steps the time forward and only 
if the error is greater than one second.
"""
> And what does max_time_lag_us refer to, anyway?
According to the comment in open-vm-tools TimeSyncReadHost():
"""
maximum time lag allowed (config option), which is a threshold that 
keeps the tools from being over eager about resetting the time when it 
is only a little bit off.
"""

Looking at open-vm-tools timeSync.c code, it defines the threshold of 
how far guest time can be from host time before deciding to do a "step 
correction".
A "step correction" is defined as explicitly setting the time in the 
guest to the time in the host.

You are right. I agree.
I think it would be best to just point to open-vm-tools 
services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c.
Do you agree or should I copy some paragraphs from there?

You are right this is a bad phrasing taken from open-vm-tools.
It should mean "How far we allow guest time to go from host time before 
guest VMware Tools will sync it to host time".
How you prefer to phrase this?

This is just a threshold as you can understand from the above reply of 
mine (I should rephrase the comments to make this clearer).
So we just chose a threshold that makes sense for common workloads.
One of the reasons to put this as a property, is to still allow user to 
override it.

I believe (don't remember) that ESXi was observed to return similar value.
Most of our workloads that runs with this came from ESXi and we never 
examined an issue regarding this in our production environment.
Which makes sense as this is just a thresthold that specifies when guest 
time should be synced to host time.
You prefer I would just remove this comment?
