Just a nit here (I hope), the target mdev does not necessarily exist at
the time we're testing migration version compatibility.  The intention
is that this feature can be used to select a target host system which
can possibly generate a compatible target mdev device before committing
to create that device.  For instance a management tool might test for
migration compatibility across a data center, narrowing the set of
potential target hosts, then proceed to select a best choice based on
factors including the ability to actually instantiate such a device on
the host.

Sounds good.  Thanks,
