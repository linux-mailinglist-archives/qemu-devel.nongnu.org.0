Yeah, my proposal [1] for building the vmlinux with PVH at test time was 
gently rejected. I was going to send a v2 where I would use a built 
kernel from somewhere. I'm glad you send this series before, so I 
discard mine in favor of yours.

Thanks for using Travis CI to check it. This way I've some minutes 
saved, otherwise I would have to test it manually. :)

No problem, I can rebase mine patches in case this get in first.
