The thing is, you're making us do all the work here. That's
not very useful to us. It's doubly unuseful when there's
a strong chance that when we do do the work of looking
at the code it turns out that there's no problem.

"I did some static analysis, and I looked at the
results, and I dug through the QEMU code, and it
does seem to me that this could well be a bug" is
definitely useful. "I did some static analysis using
only analysis techniques that have an pretty
low false positive rate, and here is a selection of
the results" is also useful. But "I just ran the
code through an analyser that produces lots of
false positives and then I didn't do any further
human examination of the results" is of much less
utility to the project, I'm afraid.

So, this is in the disassembler. The difference is
just whether we print out a register+offset memory
reference where the offset happens to be zero
as "[reg, #0]" or just "[reg]", and the no-special-case-0
is for encodings which are always pc-relative.
So even if it was a missing check the results are
entirely harmless, since anybody reading the disassembly
will understand the #0 fine.

Secondly, this code is imported from binutils,
so we usually don't worry too much about fixing
up minor bugs in it.

Finally, I went and checked the Arm specs, and for
the kinds of PC-relative load/store that the second
example is handling the specified disassembly format
does mandate the "pc, #0" (whereas the other example
is correctly skipping it for 0-immediates because
in those insns the offset is optional in disassembly).

So the code is correct as it stands.

thanks
