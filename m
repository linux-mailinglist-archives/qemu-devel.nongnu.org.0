GLib's "basic types" are one of the most misguided aspects of its
interface.

Quote https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Basic-Types.html

    GLib defines a number of commonly used types, which can be divided
    into several groups:

        New types which are not part of standard C (but are defined in
        various C standard library header files) =E2=80=94 gboolean, gssize=
.

Stuck in the 90s.

        Integer types which are guaranteed to be the same size across
        all platforms =E2=80=94 gint8, guint8, gint16, guint16, gint32, gui=
nt32,
        gint64, guint64.

Again.

        Types which are easier to use than their standard C counterparts
        - gpointer, gconstpointer, guchar, guint, gushort, gulong.

Surely, you're joking Mr. GLib.

        Types which correspond exactly to standard C types, but are
        included for completeness =E2=80=94 gchar, gint, gshort, glong, gfl=
oat,
        gdouble.

This answers your question: yes, gchar is exactly char.

It also reminds me of "It has been said that XML is like violence; if a
little doesn't solve the problem, use more."

        Types which correspond exactly to standard C99 types, but are
        available to use even if your compiler does not support C99 =E2=80=
=94
        gsize, goffset, gintptr, guintptr.

And the 90s again.

Purge with fire.
