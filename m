Reading the entire cluster will be interesting - you'll have to 
decompress the entire memory, then overwrite the zeroed portions.  The 
savings in reading occur only when your read is limited to just the 
subclusters that are zeroed.

But then again, even on a regular cluster, read has to pay attention to 
which subclusters are zeroed, so you already have the workhorse in read 
for detecting whether a normal read is sufficient or if you have to 
follow up with piecing together zeroed sections.
