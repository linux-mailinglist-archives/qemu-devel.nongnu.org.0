v1 cover from Samuel [1]:

  This patchset allows for building and running ARM targets with TCG
  disabled. It splits the target/arm/helper.c file into logical TCG and
  non TCG dependent files so that one can build and run QEMU binaries wit=
h
  or without TCG enabled.

  The rationale behind this work comes from the NEMU project where we're
  trying to only support x86 and ARM 64-bit architectures, without
  including the TCG code base. We can only do so if we can build and run
  ARM binaries with TCG disabled.

001/1:[0025] [FC] 'target/arm/helper: Move M profile routines to m_helper=
.c'

Thanks a lot to Alex and Peter for their review time, and Samuel for
the original effort.

This single patch is not a 'bugfix', simply code movement.
If it doesn't fit for 4.1-rc0, I'm still glad Peter merged all the
patches from the previous series :_

Regards,

Phil.
