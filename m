Yes, I tried it. it's ok to register SaveVMHandlers and VMStateDescription at the
same time.

if a iterative device supports postcopy, then its save_live_complete_precopy
would not get called before postcopy switchover.
However, postcopy may need to save pure device state only data (not memory) at that
time. That's the reason I think we should also register to
VMStateDescription also, as its .pre_save handler would get called at
at that time.
