Accuracy is an important part of the IEEE 754 floating point standard. The
whole purpose of this standard is to ensure floating point calculations are
consistent across multiple CPUs. I believe referring to this patch as
inaccurate is itself inaccurate. That gives the impression that this patch
produces calculations that are not inline with established standards. This
is not true. The only part of this patch that will produce incorrect values
are the flags. There *may* be a program or two out there that depend on
these flags, but for the majority of programs that only care about basic
floating point arithmetic this patch will produce correct values. Currently
the emulated PowerPC's FPU already produces wrong values for the flags.
This patch does set the Inexact flag (which I don't like), but since I have
never encountered any source code that cares for this flag, I can let it
go. I think giving the user the ability to decide which option to use is
the best thing to do.
