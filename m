Just spent an hour trying to implement this for Linux and running into issues.

1) Doesn't work because MREMAP_DONTUNMAP does in fact remove the entry
from the page table. According to the man pages "After completion, any
access to the range specified by old_address and old_size will result
in a page fault." Seems like the feature is designed around memory
locking, not mirror mapping.

2) I tried doing shm_open() and mmap() but you can't PROT_EXEC on shm
(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25275777/shared-executable-memory
)

I think it may be possible to map a file on an executable partition,
but I can foresee countless issues there including some security
issues. Anyone have any other ideas?
