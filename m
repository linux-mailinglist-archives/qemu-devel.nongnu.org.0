An mdev type is meant to define a software compatible interface, so in
the case of mdev->mdev migration, doesn't migrating to a different type
fail the most basic of compatibility tests that we expect userspace to
perform?  IOW, if two mdev types are migration compatible, it seems a
prerequisite to that is that they provide the same software interface,
which means they should be the same mdev type.

In the hybrid cases of mdev->phys or phys->mdev, how does a management
tool begin to even guess what might be compatible?  Are we expecting
libvirt to probe ever device with this attribute in the system?  Is
there going to be a new class hierarchy created to enumerate all
possible migrate-able devices?

I agree that there was a gap in the previous proposal for non-mdev
devices, but I think this bring a lot of questions that we need to
puzzle through and libvirt will need to re-evaluate how they might
decide to pick a migration target device.  For example, I'm sure
libvirt would reject any policy decisions regarding picking a physical
device versus an mdev device.  Had we previously left it that only a
layer above libvirt would select a target device and libvirt only tests
compatibility to that target device?

We also need to consider that this expands the namespace.  If we no
longer require matching types as the first level of comparison, then
vendor migration strings can theoretically collide.  How do we
coordinate that can't happen?  Thanks,
