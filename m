I think we do, but so far also only ever for immediate COW childs, not
for skipping through intermediate node.

On the off chance that the op blocker actually works, it can't be a job
filter. I was thinking more of throttling, blkdebug etc.

I doubt it. blkdebug is a really old filter.

Maybe just something like "In addition, filter nodes are not returned as
overlays any more. Instead, the first non-filter node on top of bs is
considered the overlay now."?
