Marc-Andr=C3=A9, before you invest your time to answer my questions below: =
my
bandwidth for non-trivial QAPI features like this one is painfully
limited.  To get your QAPI conditionals in, I had to postpone other QAPI
projects.  I don't regret doing that, I'm rather pleased with how QAPI
conditionals turned out.  But I can't keep postponing all other QAPI
projects.  Because of that, this one will be slow going, at best.  Sorry
about that.

In particular, background jobs (qapi/jobs.json).  They grew out of block
jobs, and are still used only for "blocky" things.  Using them more
widely would probably make sense.

Making a synchronous command asynchronous is an incompatible change.  We
need to let the client needs opt in.  How is that done in this series?

Any event that does that now is broken and needs to be fixed.  The
obvious fix is to include a monitor ID with the command ID.  For events
that can only ever be useful in the context of one particular monitor,
we could unicast to that monitor instead; see below.

Corollary: this is just a fixable bug, not a fundamental advantage of
the async feature.

The return value is useful for synchronously reporting failure to start
the background task.  I grant you that background tasks may exist that
won't ever fail to start.  I challenge the idea that it's most of them.

Broadcast reply could be avoided by unicasting events.  If I remember
correctly, Peter Xu even posted patches some time ago.  We ended up not
using them, because we found a better solution for the problem at hand.
My point is: this isn't a fundamental problem, it's just the way we
coded things up.

What do you mean by "no cancelling on disconnect"?

I'm ignoring "etc" unless you expand it into something specific.

I'm also not taking the "weird" bait :)

What do async commands provide that jobs lack?

Why do we want both?

I started to write a feature-by-feature comparison, but realized I don't
have the time to figure out either jobs or async from their (rather
sparse) documentation, let alone from code.

What is "basic cancellation"?

What extension(s) do you have in mind?

What's the impact of screendump writing synchronously?
