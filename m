To get some slightly less made-up stats, I did some searching:

  - 4408  methods with an 'errp' parameter declared

     git grep 'Error \*\*errp'|  wc -l

  - 696 methods with an 'Error *local' declared (what other names
    do we use for this?)

     git grep 'Error \*local' | wc -l

  - 1243 methods with an 'errp' parameter which have void
    return value (fuzzy number - my matching is quite crude)

     git grep 'Error \*\*errp'|  grep -E '(^| )void' | wc -l

  - 11 methods using error_append_hint with a local_err

     git grep append_hint | grep local | wc -l


This suggests to me, that if we used the 'return 0 / return -1' conventio=
n
to indicate failure for the methods which currently return void, we could
potentially only have 11 cases where a local error object is genuinely
needed.=20

If my numbers are at all accurate, I still believe we're better off
changing the return type and eliminating essentially all use of local
error variables, as void funcs/local error objects appear to be the
minority coding pattern.

At least we're both wanting to eliminate the local error + propagation.
The difference is whether we're genuinely eliminating it, or just hiding
it from view via auto-cleanup & macro magic
