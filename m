Hmm. what is sparse blocks and how it relates to backing chain?

O.

Also note, that PREALLOC_MODE_OFF actually allocates some metadata: L1 tabl=
e,
to mark new clusters as UNALLOCATED.

Anyway, I think we should at least document that "off" mode make backing fi=
le visible through new
clusters. And with your patch, we should document that "off" mode correctly=
 handles current
backing file (which may be backing file defined by qcow2 image, or may be s=
et by some other
mechanism), and otherwise new clusters will be transparent.
