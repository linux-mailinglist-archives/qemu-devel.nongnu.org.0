(Could Intel open source code for this?)

PCI DMA attack might be relevant (but yes, I see you've mentioned that
too, down-thread)

I wish we could simply wake the new CPU -- after step 07a -- with an
SMI. IOW, if we could excise steps 07b, 08a, 08b.

Our CPU hotplug controller, and the initial parked state in 01a for the
new CPU, are going to be home-brewed anyway.

On the other hand...

basically step 08b is the environment to which the new CPU returns in
13/14, after the RSM.

Do we absolutely need low RAM for 08a (for entering protected mode)? we
could execute from pflash, no? OTOH we'd still need RAM for the stack,
and that could be attacked with PCI DMA similarly. I believe.

Right.
