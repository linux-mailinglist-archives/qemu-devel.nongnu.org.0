I disagree with the parenthesis.  The completeness argument is really
simple: each occurence of member qmp is either guarded by a "is a QMP
monitor" conditional, or an "is a QMP monitor" assertion, or in a
callback that takes a QMP monitor converted to void * (I didn't bother
asserting anything there).

Actually, I didn't review the patch "in its current form", because I
found that more bothersome than splitting it up and reviewing the parts.

By effectively squashing together the parts, you have of course every
right to claim the resulting code passed my review.  That's not quite
the same as claiming my R-by for the *patch*.

Having the commit message explain that the patch mixes mechanical change
for the "replace QMP member by child class" data reorganization with its
prerequisite cleanup "access QMP stuff only when the monitor is actually
a QMP monitor" might suffice to make me acquiesce to the squashed patch.
