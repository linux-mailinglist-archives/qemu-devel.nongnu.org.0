This should fall under "Exceptions Associated with the PSW" - PoP 6-9. I=20
assume we talk about early exceptions.


"For the following error conditions, a program interrup-
tion for a specification exception occurs immediately
after the PSW becomes active:
...
Any of the unassigned bits (0, 2-4, 25-30, or
33-63) is a one.
...
Bit 12 is a one.
...
Bits 31 and 32 are zero and one, respectively,
and bits 64-96 are not all zeros.
...
Bits 31 and 32 are both zero, and bits 64-103 are
not all zeros.
Bits 31 and 32 are one and zero, respectively.
...
Programming Note: Bit 12 of an 8-byte short-format
PSW in storage is inverted when the 16-byte current
PSW is loaded from the following locations:
...
An assigned storage location in the ESA/390-
compatibility mode.
"

The ILC is usually 0 (with exceptions) and the PSW address was updated.


Note: For TCG we miss many of these validity checks. For KVM, most=20
should be triggered when running the VCPU AFAIK (that means, we don't=20
have to check for any other scenarios here). Checking for the special=20
case as given in the programming note should be sufficient.


I'll have to think about how to best handle that for TCG (mazbe what I=20
proposed works). We could ignore TCG for now and add a TODO. Then, just=20
wrap the exception in a "if (kvm_enabled())". You could also document=20
why we only have to check for this very specific bit and not the other=20
bits (handled by HW later).
