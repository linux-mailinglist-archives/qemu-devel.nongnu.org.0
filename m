Hmm OK...

Well, I think this change is simpler than it looks.

Currently the code is (what will run on older guest):

static uint32_t pflash_read(PFlashCFI01 *pfl, hwaddr offset,
                            int width, int be)
{
    switch (pfl->cmd) {
    default:
        /* This should never happen : reset state & treat it as a read*/
        DPRINTF("%s: unknown command state: %x\n", __func__, pfl->cmd);
        pfl->wcycle = 0;
        pfl->cmd = 0;
        /* fall through to read code */
    case 0x00:
        /* Flash area read */
        ret = pflash_data_read(pfl, offset, width, be);
        break;

and:

static void pflash_write(PFlashCFI01 *pfl, hwaddr offset,
                         uint32_t value, int width, int be)
{
    switch (pfl->wcycle) {
    case 0:
        /* read mode */
        switch (cmd) {
        case 0x00: /* ??? */
            goto reset_flash;
        case 0xff: /* Read array mode */
            DPRINTF("%s: Read array mode\n", __func__);
            goto reset_flash;
        default:
            goto error_flash;
        }

So current (incorrect) 0x00 will be then 0xff, and will be backprocessed
correctly.

What I want is to get ride of this 0x00 processing that is confusing,
the spec and the guests use 0xff for READ_ARRAY.

So if I increase version I can not back-migrate, but luckily it seems I
can simply update 0x00 -> 0xff without even increasing the version :)

(I'm reluctant to skip this patch because I'd rather avoid Laszlo to
re-run his tests).

Regards,

Phil.
