You are right. Although I'm not sure what page[] counts as because it adds 
an offset to the pointer but [] is higher priority than (type) cast so it 
does not matter and that cast is not needed here then. Maybe I should be 
more attentive to details but I did not take the time to look at it more 
carefully. I did not say we should keep the cast anyway (considering only 
gcc and clang are targeted), I was just trying to understand why it might 
have been there in the first place.
