Here, I'm guessing you're talking about gnutls lib/record.c.  But note:=20
for GNUTLS_SHUT_WR, it only does _gnutls_io_write_flush and=20
gnutls_alert_send; the use of _gnutls_recv_int is reserved for=20
GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR.  When informing the other end that you are not going=20
to write any more, you don't have to wait for a reply.

Oh, I'm confusing that with nbdkit, which does use=20
gnutls_bye(GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR) but does not wait for a response (at least,=20
not yet).

Okay, then for now, I'll still try and see if I can fix the=20
libnbd/nbdkit hang without relying on qemu sending a clean=20
gnutls_bye(GNUTLS_SHUT_WR).
