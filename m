If they don't cover all memory regions, the guest code can trigger a=20
data abort indeed. Since we don't know the memory layout of old board,=20
they are still supported with ignore_memory_transaction_failures=3Dtrue,=20
so guest still run unaffected.
We expect new boards to implement the minimum layout.
As long as your guest is happy and usable, UNIMP devices are fine,=20
either as big region or individual device (this requires someone with=20
access to the datasheet to verify). If you can add a UNIMP for each=20
device - which is what you did - it is even better because the the unimp=20
access log will be more useful, having finer granularity.

IOW, you already did the best you could do :)

IMHO this is the correct solution :)

Memory regions have priority. By default a device has priority 0, and=20
UNIMP device has priority -1000.

So you can use:

    serial_mm_init(get_system_memory(), AW_H3_UART0_REG_BASE, 2,
                   s->irq[AW_H3_GIC_SPI_UART0], 115200,
                   serial_hd(0), DEVICE_NATIVE_ENDIAN);
    create_unimplemented_device("DesignWare-uart",\
                                AW_H3_UART0_REG_BASE,
                                0x400);

(Or cleaner, add a create_designware_uart(...) function that does both).

(qemu) info mtree
...
    0000000001c28000-0000000001c2801f (prio 0, i/o): serial
    0000000001c28000-0000000001c283ff (prio -1000, i/o): DesignWare-uart

You could create an UNIMP region of 0x400 - 0x20 =3D 0x3e0, but that would=
=20
appear this is a different device, so I don't recommend that.
