I see your point. In retrospect, it might've been better to include it
in patch 8/8 so it's more clear why these features are introduced within
the same patch set.

If there are any requests to change / fixup this patch in any other
regard, then I'll consider moving the offset_cpu calculation to 8/8.

Otherwise, I'll leave it here :)

Thanks!
