Please, find the new version.
The patches 3 and 4 were updated.

However, is there any reason that not all the tests are executed?
I ran 'check -qcow2' without list of the tests, and encountered some 
problems with test 286 (that are fixed now).
But this test was not executed in your gitlab repository and with 'make 
check' on my local machine.
