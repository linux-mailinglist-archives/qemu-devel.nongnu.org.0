I would like to say that RHEL is not a gold standard, but then I have
this series of selfish patches that specifically addresses RHEL
whitelisting issues.

It feels a bit weird to me to say =E2=80=9Cblkverify is not essential, be=

RHEL disables it, but null-co is=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 even though there is =
no reason why
anyone would need null-co except for testing either.

Hm, really?  I just whitelisted qcow2 and file and running the auto
group worked rather well (except for the failing tests you address here,
and the two others I mentioned).

I=E2=80=99m OK either way: We can add a global check, or we just make a d=
ecision
on what users definitely have to have enabled or the qemu build would be
a bit boring.

Assuming file, qcow2, and raw to be enabled seems reasonable.  I=E2=80=99=
m not
so sure about null-co.

(I mean, I personally don=E2=80=99t really care.  I never added such chec=
ks
myself, even a bit purposefully so, because it was my opinion that you
should probably have all block drivers whitelisted before running the
iotests.  But then came CI and make check-block integration...)

((Also, you=E2=80=99ll notice that I was really inconsequential about add=

null-co checks in my =E2=80=9Cselfish patches=E2=80=9D series, precisely =

just making it an implicit prerequisite.))

Ah, yeah.  The whitelist is relevant only for the system emulator.

I forgot why we even had the existing check, then.  Maybe just a mistake
to use qemu-img.

If we assume that null-co is there, raw is definitely going to be there.
