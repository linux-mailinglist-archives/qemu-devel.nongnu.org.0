I kind of thought of the same thing after I send the patch. I'll see now =
it I can make it work.

Exactly. Since I already know the area of qemu-img relatively well, and
this bug is on my backlog, I thought why not to do it.

I personally don't really think that zeros are important, but rather the =
level of allocation.
posix_fallocate probably won't write the data blocks but rather only the =
inode metadata / used block bitmap/etc.

On the other hand writing zeros (or anything else) will force the block l=
ayer to actually write to the underlying
storage which could trigger lower layer allocation if the underlying stor=
age is thin-provisioned.

In fact IMHO, instead of writing zeros, it would be better to write rando=
m garbage instead (or have that as an even 'fuller'
preallocation mode), since underlying storage might 'compress' the zeros.=
=20

In this version I do have a bug that I mentioned, about not preallocation=
 some data at the end of the image, and I will
fix it, so that all image is zeros as expected
