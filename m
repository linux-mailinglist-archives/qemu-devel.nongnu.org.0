I definitely don't have time for keeping the edk2 blobs bundled with
QEMU fresh wrt. security fixes in upstream edk2, so anyone expecting
that is in for a bad surprise. The blobs are provided, from my
perspective, (a) for some tests in the test suite (such as
bios-tables-test for the aarch64 target), (b) as a convenience for
end-users that desire to build QEMU from source, without wanting to
build OVMF from source.

I don't understand the particular problem (or rather: use case) that
Olaf is reporting (and this is not the first time). I see four classes
of people here:

(1) end-users described above, in point (b) -- then, there is no need
for rebuilding the bundled edk2 binaries using the QEMU build infrastructure

(2) end-users building everything from source (genuine standalone clones
/ checkouts), for themselves

(3) distributors building everything from source (genuine, standalone
clones / checkouts), for their users

(4) QEMU co-maintainers that sometimes refresh the binaries -- this is
the only group that the build infra *needs* to work for (in the future,
the edk2 build infra should actually target a remote build system, but
we're not there yet -- and even in that case, the edk2 build scripts
inside the QEMU tree will only have to work for *that* environment)

Olaf: if you build QEMU from source, why don't you build SeaBIOS, iPXE,
edk2 etc *also* from their corresponding pristine upstream clones /
checkouts, using your own dedicated build scripts / packagings?

... On the technical side, I guess the problem is that edk2, unlike some
other submodules of QEMU, has its own submodules (meaning that, from the
QEMU superproject's perspective, edk2 creates recusrive submodules). I
have really zero idea how to deal with that (or more precisely, what the
grander impact of that would be); but importantly, it does not *matter*,
in my opinion. If you don't co-maintain the edk2 binaries bundled with
QEMU, then the edk2 build stuff present in QEMU is not *required* to
work for you.

If you don't like that, feel free to post patches, or I can quit even
this level of maintenance for the bundled edk2 binaries. I will
absolutely not consider downstream packaging needs with *how* the
bundled edk2 binaries are built.

Thanks
Laszlo
