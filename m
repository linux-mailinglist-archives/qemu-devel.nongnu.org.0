This isn't review (yet), just an attempt to advise more quickly on
general QAPI/QMP conventions.

Unit prefixes like Mebi- are nice for humans, because 1MiB is clearer
than 1048576B.

QMP is for machines.  We eschew unit prefixes and unit symbols there.
The unit is implied.  Unit prefixes only complicate things.  Machines
can deal with 1048576 easily.  Also dealing 1024Ki and 1Mi is additional
work.  We therefore use JSON numbers for byte counts, not strings with
units.

The general rule is "always use the plainest implied unit that would
do."  There are exceptions, mostly due to review failure.

Byte rates should be in bytes per second.

For time, we've made a godawful mess.  The plainest unit is clearly the
second.  We commonly need sub-second granularity, though.
Floating-point seconds are unpopular for some reason :)  Instead we use
milli-, micro-, and nanoseconds, and even (seconds, microseconds) pairs.

QAPI schema documentation describes both the generated C and the QMP
wire protocol.  It must be written with the implied unit.  If you send a
byte rate in bytes per second via QMP, that's what you document.  Even
if a human interface lets you specify the byte rate in MiB/s.

Does this make sense?

Do these values matter?  Is there a use case for passing
18446744073709550593 via CLI?

Maybe.
