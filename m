Drat! Looking at the crash sources:

  https://github.com/crash-utility/crash/blob/master/s390x.c#L378

... it seems like crash is rather rounding up to the next 4 bytes boundary 
instead of the next 8 bytes boundary. Thus things go wrong now when QEMU 
writes writes the "CORE" notes section. In the old code we were using 4 + 1 
as a lengths, so crash correctly rounded this up to 8. But now with 4 as a 
length, this does not work right anymore :-(

Seems like I either misunderstood the "ELF-64 Object File Format" 
specification, or this is a bug in the crash utility (it should either add 1 
to n_namesz for the trailing NUL or pad to 8 instead of 4)? Anyway, it's 
maybe better to keep the "+ 1" in QEMU for now to avoid breaking things, I 
guess?
