Here are some more patches that get rid of global_qtest and related
functions in some of the qtests (hacked along the way while waiting
for other compilation and test processes to finish). A global variable
like global_qtest is very problematic in tests that track multiple test
states (like migration tests). But since we often share code between
tests, it is better to avoid these global_qtest related functions
completely - i.e. the plan is to get rid of global_qtest completely
in the long run.

Thomas Huth (6):
  tests/libqos: Get rid of global_qtest dependency in qvring_init()
  tests/q35-test: Make test independent of global_qtest
  tests/numa-test: Use qtest_init() instead of qtest_start()
  tests/qom-test: Use qtest_init() instead of qtest_start()
  tests/device-introspect: Use qtest_init() instead of qtest_start()
  tests/hd-geo-test: Use qtest_init() instead of qtest_start()
