Hm, except that only works if the file is just completely unallocated.
Calling that existing infrastructure is a bit of a stretch, I think.

Or are you saying that bdrv_co_block_status(..., 0, bdrv_getlength(),
...) is our existing infrastructure?  Actually, why not.  Can we make
block drivers catch that special case?  (Or might the generic block code
somehow truncate such requests?)

OK.  I=E2=80=99m not 100% sure there=E2=80=99s nothing that would bite us i=
n the butt
here, but I seem to remember you made all block_status things 64-bit, so
I suppose you know. :)

True.  But if we/you want 64-bit commands anyway, then it doesn=E2=80=99t r=

matter what=E2=80=99s more invasive.

Absolutely.  It=E2=80=99s just that if you do one anyway and it supersedes =
the
other, than we don=E2=80=99t have to do both.  Hence me wondering whether o=

Hm.  You know better than me whether that=E2=80=99s a good argument, becaus=
e it
mostly depends on how many NBD server implementations there are;
specifically whether there are any that are decidedly not feature-complete.

I suppose one 64-bit discard/write_zeroes to the whole image wouldn=E2=80=

too bad, regardless of the network speed.

Sure, but implementing a feature on the basis of =E2=80=9CSomebody may come=
 up
with a use for it=E2=80=9D sounds fishy to me.

OTOH, you completely convinced me with the fact that we can start by
letting qemu=E2=80=99s NBD server just invoke a block-status call over the =
whole
image, and then (potentially later) letting various block drivers
recognize that case.  But I suppose that means we no longer need a
dedicated has_zero_open() function, right?

If we have both 64-bit write_zeroes and a zero flag in the NBD protocol,
then I don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=99s much difference in terms of effi=
ciency.

However, if we had to decide between which of the features is more
important for efficiency, then the difference that appears to me is that:
- With just a flag but no 64-bit write_zeroes, zeroing a non-zero image
will be inefficient.
- With just a 64-bit write_zeroes but no flag, the client has to issue a
NOP whole-image write_zeroes call for images that are zero already, but
I don=E2=80=99t really see that as an issue.

So *if* we had to decide, it appears to me that 64-bit write_zeroes
would be more important.
