Ouch, that sounds ugly, indeed.

Sounds like the best option right now.

Is capstone good enough already to replace libvixl?

And what about the other old disassemblers that we have in disasm/ ?
Could some of them be replaced by capstone, too?
Or shall we try to pursue the idea of adding a GPLv3 helper program that
could link against recent versions of libopcode?

And what about new disassembler files like the Loongson 2F disassembler
that has been proposed two months ago? Shall we enforce that people try
to add such stuff to capstone first?
