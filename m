Title:
  qemu-img check failing on remote image in Eoan

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu source package in Eoan:
  Fix Committed
Status in qemu source package in Focal:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Ubuntu SRU Template:

  [Impact]

   * There is fallout due to changes in libcurl that affect qemu and might =

     lead to a hang.

   * Fix by backporting the upstream fix

  [Test Case]

   * If you have network just run
     $ qemu-img check http://10.193.37.117/cloud/eoan-server-cloudimg-amd64=
.img

   * Without network, install apache2, and get a complex qemu file (like a =

     cloud image) onto the system. Then access the file via apache http but =

     not localhost (that would work)

  [Regression Potential]

   * The change is local to the libcurl usage of qemu, so that could be =

     affected. But then this is what has been found to not work here, so I'=
d =

     expect not too much trouble. But if so then in the curl usage (which =

     means disks on http)

  [Other Info]
   =

   * n/a

  ---

  The "qemu-img check" function is failing on remote (HTTP-hosted)
  images, beginning with Ubuntu 19.10 (qemu-utils version 1:4.0+dfsg-
  0ubuntu9). With previous versions, through Ubuntu 19.04/qemu-utils
  version 1:3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu3.5, the following worked:

  $ /usr/bin/qemu-img check  http://10.193.37.117/cloud/eoan-server-cloudim=
g-amd64.img
  No errors were found on the image.
  19778/36032 =3D 54.89% allocated, 90.34% fragmented, 89.90% compressed cl=
usters
  Image end offset: 514064384

  The 10.193.37.117 server holds an Apache server that hosts the cloud
  images on a LAN. Beginning with Ubuntu 19.10/qemu-utils 1:4.0+dfsg-
  0ubuntu9, the same command never returns. (I've left it for up to an
  hour with no change.) I'm able to wget the image from the same server
  and installation on which qemu-img check fails. I've tried several
  .img files on the server, ranging from Bionic to Eoan, with the same
  results with all of them.
