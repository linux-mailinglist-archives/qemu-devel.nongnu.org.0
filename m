For now, I have just several generic comments:

1. that's quite a lot code to maintain, why not use existing UEFI vars
   as pstore storage instead? 
   Not sure ancient ACPI table is a way to go, with NVDIMMs around
   it probably possible to use pstores ram backend or make it work
   with nvdimms directly. The only benefit of ERST is that it should
   just work without extra configuration, but then UEFI backend
   would probably also just work.

2. patch is too big to review, please split it up in smaller chunks.

3. Use of packed structures is discouraged in new ACPI code,
   see build_ghes_v2() as an example for building ACPI tables.

4. Maybe instead of SYSBUS device, implement it as a PCI device and
   use its BAR/control registers for pstore storage and control interface.
   It could save you headache of picking address where to map it +
   it would take care of migration part automatically, as firmware
   would do it for you and then QEMU could pickup firmware programmed
   address and put it into ERST table.

5. instead of dealing with file for storage directly, reuse hostmem backend
   to provide it to for your device. ex: pc-dimm. i.e. split device
   on frontend and backend
