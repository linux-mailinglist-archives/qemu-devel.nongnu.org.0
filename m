This phrasing reads a bit confusingly to me. What I would usually expect
is that you get
  name-of-option              Description of what the option does.

But here we have
  name-of-option              Long description of the default behaviour,
                              taking many lines and several sentences.
                              Brief note at the end that enabling this
                              feature gives the opposite effect.

Especially since the default-behaviour description isn't prefaced
with "By default" or similar, it's quite easy to start reading the
text assuming it's defining what the option is going to do, only
to get to the end and realise that it's defining what the option
is *not* going to do...

Incidentally, if I understand things correctly, for TCG the
behaviour is (and has always been) that VM-stopped time is
not counted, because we run the emulated versions of these counters
off QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL. So having the KVM default be the same as
the TCG default is nicely consistent.
