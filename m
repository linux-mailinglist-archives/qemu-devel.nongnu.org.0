The market/industry evolves quicker than the QEMU codebase, so some=20
technical namings that were fine 14 years ago might be not sufficient=20
nowadays.

QEMU started with dies/chipsets being really only a=20
CentralProcessingUnit, cache managed off-die, external RAM, external=20
peripherals.

For example the R4000 is a CPU with internal cache but QEMU doesn't=20
model caches.

Now compare that with the I6500. Is it a CPU? Yes and no...
It has 4-6 cores (each having its own ScratchPad RAM), each core having=20
various threads (now 'thread' =3D=3D QEMU MIPS CPU), there are peripherals=
=20
dedicated to inter-core communication; then there is also some I/O=20
coherence units to use external peripherals. Add to that you can=20
clusterize the cores :)
All that in the same die. The industry calls this 'System-on-Chip',=20
abbreviated SoC.
Actually the 'SoC' abbreviation is used as it by MIPS marketing:
https://www.mips.com/products/warrior/i-class-i6500-multiprocessor-core/

   "As such, in conjunction with popular third party SoC coherent
   interconnect/fabric alternatives, the I6500 family can be used
   in =E2=80=9Cmany core=E2=80=9D implementations of up to 64 clusters, or =
>1500
   processing elements (up to four threads/core, up to six
   cores/cluster, up to 64 clusters)."


MCU and SoC are similar in that they contains CPU and peripherals in the=20
same die.


Now the QEMU codebase has various 'subsystems' of interests. Group of=20
developers are custom to work in the same subsystems. When I'm writing=20
code/comments targeting a specific group, I try to use the technical=20
vocabulary used by the group, often based on the subsystem technical=20
documentation available (specs, datasheets). This is why here I used the=20
MCU terminology.
