Since the last submission was long ago we can safely assume
Zihan moved to other projects.
Thanks Zihan for the great work!

I don't Zihan would mind, anyway I fully agree on keeping his authorship.
His work is part of GSOC, so there is no problem with the licensing either.

I would start with merging his work with latest QEMU and giving it a try.
MSI/MSIx PCI devices should simply work.

If I remember correctly 2 issues remain:
1. Devices with legacy interrupts do not work (some INTx wiring issue)
2. Running lspci -vt does not show the correct tree (every pxb should 
start a separate PCI hierarchy)

Good luck!
Marcel
