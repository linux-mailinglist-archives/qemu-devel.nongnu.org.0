That series is related to a migration compatibility interface, not the
migration data itself.

So you're suggesting that any time the kernel is passing through opaque
data that gets interpreted by some entity elsewhere, potentially with
proprietary code, that we're in legal jeopardy?  VFIO is certainly not
the first to do that (storage and network devices come to mind).
Devices are essentially opaque data themselves, vfio provides access to
(ex.) BARs, but the interpretation of what resides in that BAR is device
specific.  Sometimes it's defined in a public datasheet, sometimes not.
Suggesting that we can't move opaque data through a uAPI seems rather
absurd.

I don't know what this means.

Yikes, I thought out-of-process devices was exactly the compromise
being developed to avoid QEMU supporting proprietary modules and ad-hoc
vendor specific uAPIs.  I think you're actually questioning even the
premise of developing a standardized API for out-of-process devices
here.  Thanks,

Alex
