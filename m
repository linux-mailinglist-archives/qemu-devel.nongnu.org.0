The other possible way is I'm wondering whether we can try to do a whole
stack dump when an assertion happened.

With a backtrace we can easily see the function pointer so that'll be
another way of knowing which test we're running, slightly more awkward than
dumping the names but probably still good enough for developers.

It also contains more information so sometimes we can already spot the bug
even before trying to reproduce.

Though I'm not sure whether it's easily feasible, e.g., the tests are
mostly using g_assert*() families and I've no idea of any good way to let
it happen if without replacing all of them to inject a dump.

Thanks,
