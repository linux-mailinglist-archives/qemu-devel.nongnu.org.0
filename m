I really think we're discussing semantical interpretation details here which

Yes ... :)

... and no, this cannot happen if minimum msize of 4096 is forced already by 
Tversion. Maybe you now get my point -> It is about avoiding exactly such kind 
of issues in the first place. Most file systems have a name limit of 255 
bytes:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#Limits

So by forcing a minimum 'msize' of 4096 you avoid having to deal with this  
issue (and similar ones) on Treaddir request level (and other request type 
handlers), including ReiserFS BTW because 4032+35 < 4096.

If you would allow smaller 'msize' values by Tversion, then you would need to 
suffer some kind of death when handling Treaddir with certain high file name 
length. Either a transport error (with an error message that a normal user 
would not be able to understand at all) or by returning an incomplete Treaddir 
response sequence with { Rreaddir count=0 }, or ... any other kind of death.

No matter which death you would choose here, it would be horrible from 
usability perspective, because the system would most of the time work 
flawlessy, and an error case would just be triggered if guest hits a file/dir 
beyond some certain name length. It is not worth it! Force 4kiB already at 
Tversion and that's it.

Also yes and no. Of course it just makes sense to handle it already at 
Tversion. But no, you could theoretically also allow much smaller minimum 
'msize' value << 4096 (i.e. somewhere closely >7 as we discussed), then you 
would indeed still need to add msize checks at other places of the code base 
as you just found out now. So forcing a minimum 'msize' which is high enough, 
avoids having to add such individual checks and having to deal with them in 
some kind of unpleasant way.

I hope this makes it more clear now.
