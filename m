What I really would like to see: Could we get rid of some of the git 
submodules, since they keep being a pain from time to time. Could we get rid 
of the capstone submodule? libslirp? dtc? ... but this needs some careful 
checking first, of course.

I think the most difficult part are maybe the custom runners in 
.gitlab-ci.d/custom-runners/ubuntu-18.04-s390x.yml ... who has access to 
that system and could try to get these updated?

We've got some more few occurances, e.g. in .gitlab-ci.d/opensbi/Dockerfile 
and in .gitlab-ci.d/containers.yml ... but that can be done by anybody who 
knows how to use the gitlab-CI.

And there are still some jobs on bionic in .travis.yml - but I can take care 
of those.
