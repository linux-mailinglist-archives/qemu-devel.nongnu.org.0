Agreed.  The idea is right (we NEED to make backup operations smarter=20
based on knowledge about both source and destination block status), but=20
the implementation is not (a check for strcncmp("qcow2") is not ideal).

The fact that qemu-img already has a lot of optimizations makes me=20
wonder what we can salvage from there into reusable code that both=20
qemu-img and block backup can share, so that we're not reimplementing=20
block status handling in multiple places.

Yes, I'm hoping Vladimir (or his other buddies at Virtuozzo) can chime=20
in.  Meanwhile, I've working on v2 of some patches that will improve=20
qemu's ability to tell if a destination qcow2 file already reads as all=20
zeroes, and we already have bdrv_block_status() for telling which=20
portions of a source image already read as all zeroes (whether or not it=20
is due to not being allocated, the goal here is that we should NOT have=20
to copy anything that reads as zero on the source over to the=20
destination if the destination already starts life as reading all zero).

And if nothing else, qemu 5.0 just added 'qemu-img convert=20
--target-is-zero' as a last-ditch means of telling qemu to assume the=20
destination reads as all zeroes, even if it cannot quickly prove it; we=20
probably want to add a similar knob into the QMP commands for initiating=20
block backup, for the same reasons.
