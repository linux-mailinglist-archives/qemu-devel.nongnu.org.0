May be it worth to send the timestamps always in the response if doesn't 
contradicts with anything and doesn't bring any unnecessary data overhead.

 From the other hand turning it on via qmp capabilities seems to be more 
flexible solution.

This is Just for convenience, may be it's too much and timestamp in msec 
if enough

So the scenario is the following: we need a means to understand from the 
management layer prospecitive of what is the timeline of the command 
execution. This is needed for a problem resolving if a qmp command 
executes for too long from the management layer point of view. 
Specifically, management layer sees the execution time as 
"management_layer_internal_routine_time" + "qemu_dispatching_time" + 
"qemu_qmp_command_execution_time". Suggested qmp command timestaps gives 
"qemu_command_execution_time". Management layer calculates 
"management_layer_internal_routine_time" internally. Using those two 
things we can calculate "qemu_dispatching_time" and decide where the 
potential delays comes from. This will gives us a direction of further 
problem investigation.
