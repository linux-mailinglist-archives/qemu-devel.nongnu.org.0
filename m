Yes, please.

I have one substantive comment on this patch: in the
MyDev example of implementing reset, you make the enter/hold/exit
functions do the reset of the subclass and then call the
myclass->parent_phases method. This feels to me like it's the
wrong way round and the parent class should reset first. Does
it make any difference to do it this way round?


Everything below here is just typo/grammar fixes, so
if you correct those then

"This is equivalent to providing a trivial implementation of the
