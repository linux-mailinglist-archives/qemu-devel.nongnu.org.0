Fair enough. jsnow/qemu/python is intended as a staging area for patches 
that have been vetted on-list.

jsnow/qemu/master is a lazily-updated mirror. (I tend to update it every 
day as part of my development process, but there are days I don't write 
code.)

jsnow/qemu/python-* is development work; review branches, etc.

I'll try to rephrase this a bit. What I want to communicate:

- This package exists as a subfolder of a larger project
- I am responsible for maintaining this package, but not for the larger 
project
- Please contact *me* for problems with this package
- Contributions should go through qemu-devel (I will gently redirect 
contributors who may send pull requests to the qemu devel list.)

Also ... licensing question, do we need *L*GPLv2, or does Python not 
have a "linking exception" problem?

I guess we can't really re-license these files anyway, so nevermind.

(I immediately regret asking this.)

Sure.

Wait, why can you specify Python as a language? Is it possible to have 
non-Python packages on PyPI?

Are these worth adding? I've got python_requires >= 3.6 down below. From 
my test of a blank package upload to PyPI, it seems to display prominently:

https://pypi.org/project/qemu/

Is there a tangible benefit that you are aware of?

Reasonable doubt. However, this isn't *required* to use the library (the 
QEMU code can continue to just set PYTHONPATH or sys.path as necessary) 
and bypasses the installer entirely.

That gives us some leeway apart from the usual version constraints; in 
order to independently use this library outside of the QEMU tree we may 
impose more modern setups -- as long as the minimum requirements for 
QEMU itself don't break.

Having a modern setuptools in order to install seems like less of a 
problem barrier; and it seemed like a good idea to make it explicitly 
fail instead of silently doing something weird if it didn't 
see/understand setup.cfg.

(And it seems like good practice to update pip in your venv, so I think 
we'll be OK except for the stodgiest of users, but sometimes you can't 
have new things on old systems without learning some new tricks!)

FWIW, for the purposes of running the linters, I am using Fedora32 and 
the python36 package.
