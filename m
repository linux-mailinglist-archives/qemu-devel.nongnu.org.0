Hi Alex, Paolo
Hitting a small issue while adding support for lto (and therefore cfi) 
to the fuzzer.

The fuzzer requires a modified linker script to place all of the stuff 
that needs to persist across fuzzing runs into a contiguous section of 
memory.

It does that by inserting three new sections after the .data section of 
the binary. Instead of rewriting a full linker script, it's using the 
*INSERT* keyword to add this to the default linker script.

Now, LTO with LLVM requires to use the gold linker, which does not have 
a default linker script and therefore does not support the *INSERT* keyword.
This can be fixed by taking the default script from the bdf linker, 
adding the additional sections and ask gold to use the full script.

However, I don't like the idea of replacing the small, self-contained 
script snippet that is currently used, with a full script (which is 
probably also dependent on the bfd/os version). So I'm thinking of 
adding a check in configure. If gold is the linker, automatically create 
(somehow, still working on it) the full link script by obtaining the 
default bfd script and add the required parts. Would that work for you?

Cheers,
Daniele
