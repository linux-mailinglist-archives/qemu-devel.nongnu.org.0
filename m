What does this look like in terms of the memory backend configuration
when you boot VM 0 and VM 1 ?

Are you saying that we boot both VMs with

   -object hostmem-memfd,size=128G,hugetlb=yes,hugetlbsize=1G,reserve=off

and then we have another property set on 'virtio-mem' to tell it
how much/little of that 128 G, to actually give to the guest ?
How do we change that at runtime ?

The hostmem backend defaults are indepdant of frontend usage, so when you
say reserve=off is the default for virtio-mem, are you expecting the mgmt
app like libvirt to specify that ?
