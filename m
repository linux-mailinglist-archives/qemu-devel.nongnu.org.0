Can you please test again with the latest QEMU 4.2 RC? There have been
quite a lot of fixes in this area in the past months, so maybe this
issue has already been resolved in 4.2.

Title:
  qemu s390x on focal - applications breaking

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Running qemu-system-s390x (1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu10) on an x86-64 Focal
  host with an upgrade of a Eoan s390x VM to a Focal s390x is triggering
  random breakage, for example:

  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

  ...
  ...

  Unpacking debianutils (4.9) over (4.8.6.3) ...
  Setting up debianutils (4.9) ...
  Use of uninitialized value $ARGV[0] in string ne at /usr/sbin/update-mime=
 line 43.
  (Reading database ... 83640 files and directories currently installed.)
  Preparing to unpack .../bash_5.0-5ubuntu1_s390x.deb ...
  Unpacking bash (5.0-5ubuntu1) over (5.0-4ubuntu1) ...
  Setting up bash (5.0-5ubuntu1) ...
  [12124.788618] User process fault: interruption code 0007 ilc:3 in bash[2=
aa3d780000+149000]
  dpkg: error processing package bash (--configure):
   installed bash package post-installation script subprocess was killed by=
 signal (Floating point exception), core du
  mped
  Errors were encountered while processing:
   bash
  E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

  And now bash is completely broken:

  cking@eoan-s390x:~$ bash
  [12676.204389] User process fault: interruption code 0007 ilc:3 in bash[2=
aa14780000+149000]

  Floating point exception (core dumped)

  The upgrade works OK on a s390x, so I'm assuming it's something to do
  with the qemu emulation.
