I suggest swapping the name: It's easier to write a glob for *-test vs. 
*-test.out than it is to write for test-* but not test-*.out.  (You 
don't want to execute the output files as a test).  That is, I suggest 
that ./check consider all 3-digit files and all files ending in -test as 
tests.

Do you plan on an additional patch (or set of patches) to rename some or 
all of the existing 3-digit tests?

Overall, having sensibly named tests makes sense to me.

If we are going to rename files, I'd also suggest that we rename the 
directory: tests/qemu-iotests/ feels redundant, compared to tests/iotests.
