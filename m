Can we work this into documentation somehow?

Have you considered adding something on VFIO migration to docs/?  Then a
link with a short description could suffice here.

My concern is providing management applications the means they need to
monitor migration.  Have you solicited input from management application
developers on what's needed?

"Same as RAM's migration" makes me suspect the same stats are needed.
This may well be a subset of the stats provided for RAM.

Missing stats we need can be added on top, as long as it's done in a
timely manner.  But we better know how to compute them, or how to do
without.
