length

If I understand correctly, data_space_length is really an upper bounds 
on the length available, because it is computed by rounding UP to the 
next 512-byte boundary (that is, the L2 descriptor lists the number of 
additional sectors used in storing the compressed data).  Which really 
means that we have the following, where + is cluster boundaries, S and E 
are the start and end of the compressed data, and D is the offset 
determined by data_space_length:

+-------+-------+------+
       S============E...D

For zlib, we have byte 0-E are compressed data, and bytes (E+1)-D (if 
any) are ignored.  There is no way to tell how many bytes between E and 
D exist, because zlib doesn't care (the compression stream itself 
ensures that decompression stops when input reaches E because the output 
reached a cluster boundary at that point).

Whereas for zstd, the decompression MUST know the actual location of E, 
rather than passing in the slop between E and D; bytes 0-3 give us that 
information.

But your description is not very accurate:  if 'x' is point E, then it 
is NOT data_space_length - 1, but rather data_space_length - slop, where 
slop can be up to 511 bytes (the number of bytes from (E+1) to D).  And 
if 'x' is point E, then the real layout for zlib is:

byte 0 - E: the compressed data content
byte E+1 - x: ignored slop (E is implied solely by the compressed data)

and for zstd is:

byte 0 - 3: the length of the compressed data
byte 4 - E: the compressed data (E computed from byte 0-3)
byte E+1 - x: ignored

I'm not sure what the best way is to document this.

Where does the magic number 5 come from?

The if is awkward.  I'd prefer to change this to:

     /*
      * Our largest cluster is 2M, and we insist that compression
      * actually compressed things.
      */
     assert(ret < UINT32_MAX);

or even tighten to assert(ret <= dest_size)

You are correct that ZSTD_decompress() is picky that it must be given 
the exact size of the compressed buffer it is decompressing.  But the 
ZSTD manual mentions that if an exact size is not known in advance, that 
the streaming API can be used instead:

https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter9

In other words, would it be possible to NOT have to prepend four bytes 
of exact size information, by instead setting up decompression via the 
streaming API where the input is (usually) oversized, but the output 
buffer limited to exactly one cluster is sufficient to consume the exact 
compressed data and ignore the slop, just as we do in zlib?

The rest of this patch looks okay.
