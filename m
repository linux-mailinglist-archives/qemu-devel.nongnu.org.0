Yeah, the lack of reset is a bug in the pl031. I did have
a draft set of patches where I tried to fix that, but I
got stuck because it was a bit unclear what I ought to be
resetting. In a real hardware pl031 there is no persistent
storage of the RTC value -- it's just a 1Hz counter, really,
and guest firmware will write to it on startup (from some
other real RTC). In QEMU we use it as a sort of "RTC for a
VM", and back it with the QEMU RTC clock, so it doesn't
behave quite as the hardware does but more like "view that
you'd see from a combination of h/w and firmware behaviour".

TLDR: don't use the pl031 code as a good model of how to do an RTC,
it has some definite flaws. x86 or ppc RTC handling is
probably a better place to look.

Another random question -- is there an existing RTC device
we could put in the riscv board rather than adding a new
model of this goldfish device? Put another way, what are
the merits of using goldfish in particular?

We should probably document this device in docs/specs since it's
a pure-virtual device. (You have a link to the URL for the
GOLDFISH-VIRTUAL-HARDWARE.TXT for the android emulator, but that
doesn't seem to match the implementation here -- the doc says the
alarm registers are non-functional but this code does something with
them.)

Test and fix later is fine. That said, I've just remembered
that for an RTC migration is potentially a tricky area
because you typically don't want a vmsave-vmload to
give you the same RTC value after load that there was on
store, you want it to still be following the host RTC.
We got that wrong on the PL031 and had to put in some ugly
workarounds to maintain migration compatibility when we fixed it.
So maybe it would be better to mark as non-migratable for now.
