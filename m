Ok, creating an alternate attribute for non-mdev devices makes sense.
However, wouldn't that rather be a case (3)? The change here only
refers to mdev devices.

Hm. Non-existence of (1) seems to imply "this type does not support
migration". If an mdev created for such a type suddenly does support
migration, it feels a bit odd.

(It obviously cannot be a prereq for what I called (3) above.)

How useful would it be for userspace to even look at (1) in that case?
It only knows if things have a chance of working if it actually goes
ahead and creates devices.

What do we actually need here, I wonder? (1) and (2) seem to serve
slightly different purposes, while (2) and what I called (3) have the
same purpose. Is it important to userspace that (1) and (2) have the
same name?
