Sorry, you're correct. The API function was originally designed to
support delta extents for supporting diff exports, so while it does
open each snapshot's object-map, it only returns a unioned set of
delta extents. The rbd CLI's "disk-usage" action behaves how I
described by counting the actual dirty block usage between snapshots.
