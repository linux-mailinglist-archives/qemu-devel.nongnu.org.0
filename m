Depending on how much machinery is required to trigger this we could
add a system mode test. However there isn't much point if it requires
duplicating the entire guest hotplug stack. It maybe easier to trigger
on ARM - the PCSI sequence isn't overly complicated to deal with but I
don't know what the impact of MSIs is.
