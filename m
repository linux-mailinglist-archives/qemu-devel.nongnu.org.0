Pavel,

Do you know how is this resolved for other platforms?

How other platfirms organize and use terms "soc", "mcu", "cpu",  "core",
"cpu core"? And what is the relation between each of them and QEMU command
line options "-cpu" and "-machine"? Is thar organization the same accross
all platforms?

(I am asking you as you most likely have much wider experience in the
topic, sincr mine i limited to mips emulation)

Yours, Aleksandar

Philippe, hi.<br>
<br>
Thank you for the impetus you give us all.<br>
<br>
However, is this the right direction?<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s analyse some bits and pieces.<br>
<br>
Starting from the commit message, the word &quot;famous&quot; is used, but =
I<br>
really don&#39;t see enumerated CPUs/MCUs are any special in Atmel lineup.<=

Other than we often used the doc describing them (cited several times<br>
in our discussions) as our reference, but that doesn&#39;t make them<br>
&quot;famous&quot;. Ofcourse, there other docs for other Atmel CPUs/MCUs, o=
f at<br>
lest equivalent significance. For example, &quot;tiny&quot; ones are at lea=
st as<br>
famous as &quot;mega&quot; ones.<br>
<br>
Then, you introduce the term MCU, without proper discussion with<br>
others on terminology. In parlance of QEMU, ATmega168 at al. are CPUs<br>
(we all know and assume that that are some peripherals in it). I am<br>
not against using the term MCU, but let&#39;s first sync up on that.<br>
<br>
The added terminology trouble is that MCUs, as you defined them, have<br>
in array atmega_mcu[] a field called &quot;cpu_type&quot; - why is that fie=
ld<br>
not called &quot;mcu_type&quot;? *Very* confusing for any future reader. An=
d<br>
then, similar terminology conundrum continues with macro<br>
AVR_CPU_TYPE_NAME().<br>

<br>
MCU is a system-on-chip which includes CPU core and peripheral devices.<br>
Separating this is better that including everything into the machine.<br>

E.g., different MCUs may have different IO addresses for USART.<br>
