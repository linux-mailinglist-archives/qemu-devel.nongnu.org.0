Now it makes more sense to me, thanks Philippe for explaining this!
Great, I'll add .impl.min_access_size =3D 4.

At this point, I've processed all the feedback that I received for all of
the patches
in this series. Is there anything else you would like to
see/discuss/review, or shall I send the v2 when I finish testing?

Niek
