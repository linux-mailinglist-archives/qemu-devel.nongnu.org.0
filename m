Re-sending with qemu-devel included:

Generally 4.0.x is maintained until 4.1 releases, 4.1.x until 4.2,
etc. It's not a hard cut-off though, if a release is needed for
something significant like a CVE or regression a month or so past
that then a release might still be made. We just can't keep supporting
every branch forever, but if something is brought to my intention
that's not too far outside that window then I'll generally try to
work something out.

The safest bet though is to target fixes for a major release N,
tag/Cc: qemu-stable@nongnu, and it should get picked up for
a stable release of N-1 if applicable. Anything beyond that, let me
know.

3.1.1/3.1.1.1 were quite a bit later than usual due to delays on my
end and late-breaking CVEs; consider those exceptional cases.

There are more details on the process here:
