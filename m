Right.

Hm, ok.  My mental model has always been that defaults were
essentially per-machine-type.  Which, I grant you isn't really
consistent with the existence of the -device dev,? probing.  On the
other hand, it's possible for a machine/platforms to impose
restrictions on almost any property of almost any device, and it would
suck for the user to have to know all of them just in order to start
things up with default options.

Given that model, extending that to per-machine-variant, including
machine options like htl seemed natural.

I don't know off hand if we have per-machine differences for certain
options in practice, or only in theory.

Uh.. fair enough.. I just need to figure out where.

Ugh.. so.  That policy of libvirt's is very double edged.  It's there
because it allows libvirt to create consistent machines that can be
migrated properly and so forth.  However, it basically locks libvirt
into having to know about every option of qemu, ever.  Unsurprisingly
there are some gaps, hence things like this.

Unfortunately that can't be fixed without substantially redesigning
libvirt in a way that can't maintain compatibility.

Yeah, I guess we'd need to.  See "having to know about every option"
above :/.  No, I haven't thought about a design for that.

on/off/auto works for your case on s390, but I don't think it works
for POWER, though I forget the details, so maybe I'm wrong about that.
