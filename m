To be honest, I still do not completely understand why there is a
different behavior when we specify the script within a group. The man
page for ld.bfd doesn't talk about linker arguments between
--start-group and --end-group that are not archives. If I understand the
purpose of these linker groups, the linker script should still apply to
everything (regardless where it is specified). I would expect there to
be no change in behavior, or a complaint about passing linker arguments
that are not archive paths.

I was also worried about what would happen to all the __wrap_qtest
arguments, since those are still in the group, and they can fail silently.
Disassembling the binary confirmed that all the calls to
qtest_{in*,out*} are still wrapped.

Anyways.. I tested this series with and without LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE, and
used nm to confirm that the layout of the symbols/data is correct in
both cases (at least on my machine and the oss-fuzz docker) ..
