What partition formats would have to be supported?  But honestly I'm
more worried about the networking part.

GRUB netboot support is almost never used.  There are three cases:

- QEMU BIOS: the NIC ROM contain iPXE, which is both the driver code and
the boot loader (which chains into GRUB).

- Bare metal BIOS: same, but the boot loader is minimal so most of the
time iPXE is loaded via TFTP and reuses the NIC ROM's driver code.

- UEFI: the NIC ROM contains driver code only and the firmware does the
rest.

None, besides being able to play space invaders written in Forth.  I'm
not against dropping most OpenFirmware capabilities, I'm against adding
a limited (or broken depending on what you're trying to do) version that
runs in the host.

Yes, SLOF is big and slow.  petitboot is not petit at all either, and
has the disadvantage that you have to find a way to run GRUB afterwards.
 But would a similarly minimal OF implementation (no network, almost no
interpret so no Forth, device tree built entirely in the host, etc.) be
just as big and slow?
