There is no need for extra registration if the services are queued.
You can then query the queue of org.qemu.VhostUser instances.

This is the approach I took in v1 of this series with
org.qemu.VMState1 service name.

See https://patchew.org/QEMU/20190708072437.3339-1-marcandre.lureau@redhat.=
com/20190708072437.3339-4-marcandre.lureau@redhat.com/

as well as the libvirt series
https://patchew.org/Libvirt/20190708070747.1962-1-marcandre.lureau@redhat.c=
om/


Other approaches are common prefix (ex:
org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.FooBar), which also allows to identify a
particular implementation in a simple way.
