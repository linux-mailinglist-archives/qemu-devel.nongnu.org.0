Yes, to support this the vfio driver would need to be able to exclude
ranges of guest GPA space.  Recent kernels already expose an IOVA list
via the vfio API.  Clearly, excluding GPA ranges has implications for
hotplug.  On x86 the ranges are pretty consistent, but IIRC differ
between Intel and AMD.  The vfio IOVA list was originally developed for
an ARM use case though, and I imagine there's little or no consistency
there.

Re: pci=3Dnomsi, the reserved range exists regardless of whether MSI is
actually used.

Title:
  PCIe cards passthrough to TCG guest works on 2GB of guest memory but
  fails on 4GB (vfio_dma_map invalid arg)

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  During one meeting coworker asked "did someone tried to passthrough
  PCIe card to other arch guest?" and I decided to check it.

  Plugged SATA and USB3 controllers into spare slots on mainboard and
  started playing. On 1GB VM instance it worked (both cold- and hot-
  plugged). On 4GB one it did not:

  I played with memory and 3054 MB is maximum value possible to boot VM wit=
