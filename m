This is very helpful, thanks.

Thanks, I got it working now.

I've been adding new peripherals incrementally after the basic SoC
support patch. Is that OK to do without resetting the tags?

But it's more likely that I'll add other things than peripherals next,
i.e. bootrom and tests.

Good point. I'll see if I can upload images to github. I might fork
the openbmc repository and attach binaries to a github release, to
make it clear where the binaries came from.

I accidentally broke my test image and had some trouble recreating it,
so I ended up reworking my various hacks a bit. The good news is that
I got most of them turned into proper bug fixes that I can send
upstream.

It might take a little longer than I said previously, but I'll try to
include acceptance tests in the next series.
