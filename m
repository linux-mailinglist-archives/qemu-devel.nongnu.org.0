Good spot - I obviously got carried away with the "arm64:" prefix ;)

It's less about the page vanishing and more that pfn_to_online_page()
will reject some pages. Specifically in this case we want to reject any
sort of device memory (e.g. graphics card memory or other memory on the
end of a bus like PCIe) as it is unlikely to support MTE.

I've taken the decision not to require that the VMM allocates with
PROT_MTE, there are two main reasons for this:

 1. The VMM generally doesn't actually want a PROT_MTE mapping as the
tags from the guest are almost certainly wrong for most usages (e.g.
device emulation). So a PROT_MTE mapping actively gets in the way of the
VMM using MTE for it's own purposes. However this then leads to the
requirement for the new ioctl in patch 7.

 2. Because the VMM can change the pages in a memslot at any time and
KVM relies on mmu notifiers to spot the change it's hard and ugly to
enforce that the memslot VMAs keep having the PROT_MTE flag. When I
tried this it meant we've discover that a page doesn't have the MTE flag
at fault time and have no other option that to kill the VM at that time.

So the model is that non-PROT_MTE memory can be supplied to the memslots
and KVM will automatically upgrade it to PG_mte_tagged if you supply it
to a VM with MTE enabled. This makes the VMM implementation easier for
most cases, and the new ioctl helps for migration. I think the kernel
code is tidier too.

Of course even better would be a stage 2 flag to control MTE
availability on a page-by-page basis, but that doesn't exist in the
architecture at the moment.

I do now - I was tricked by the use of '0' as false. Looks like false
('0') is actually the correct return here to avoid an unnecessary
kvm_flush_remote_tlbs().

Yes - however at the moment our sanitised view is either FEAT_MTE2 or
nothing:

	{
		.desc = "Memory Tagging Extension",
		.capability = ARM64_MTE,
		.type = ARM64_CPUCAP_STRICT_BOOT_CPU_FEATURE,
		.matches = has_cpuid_feature,
		.sys_reg = SYS_ID_AA64PFR1_EL1,
		.field_pos = ID_AA64PFR1_MTE_SHIFT,
		.min_field_value = ID_AA64PFR1_MTE,
		.sign = FTR_UNSIGNED,
		.cpu_enable = cpu_enable_mte,
	},

When host support for FEAT_MTE3 is added then the KVM code will need
revisiting to expose that down to the guest safely (AFAICS there's
nothing extra to do here, but I haven't tested any of the MTE3
features). I don't think we want to expose newer versions to the guest
than the host is aware of. (Or indeed expose FEAT_MTE if the host has
MTE disabled because Linux requires at least FEAT_MTE2).

Thanks,

Steve
