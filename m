Pressing AltGr in graphics mode issues two key modifiers while only one is issued when the guest is in text mode. I'll recheck tomorrow when I have access to a Windows host.

Hi Bernhard,

the AltGr behavior depends on the keyboard grab. The AltGr key works 
without keyboard grabbed and it doesn't with keyboard grabbed. That's a bug.

I'm running with `-accel whpx -vga none -device virtio-vga-gl -display sdl,gl=on` and I even get decent OpenGL accelleration when the Linux guest is in graphics mode, with wobbly windows etc. Sometimes QEMU aborts when it can't map some OpenGL stuff when the guest enters graphics mode but once that succeeds it runs absolutely stable.

I tested with QEMU 7.1 and sometimes it also locks up. This indicates 
that the QEMU code doesn't have an issue.
