Hi, everybody=EF=BC=9A

I developed a feature named "I/O hang"=EF=BC=8Cmy intention is to solve t=
he=20
problem like that=EF=BC=9A
If the backend storage media of VM disk is far-end storage like IPSAN or=20
FCSAN, storage net link will always disconnection and
make I/O requests return EIO to Guest, and the status of filesystem in=20
Guest will be read-only, even the link recovered
after a while, the status of filesystem in Guest will not recover.

So I developed a feature named "I/O hang" to solve this problem, the=20
solution like that=EF=BC=9A
when some I/O requests return EIO in backend, "I/O hang" will catch the=20
requests in qemu block layer and
insert the requests to a rehandle queue but not return EIO to Guest, the=20
I/O requests in Guest will hang but it does not lead
Guest filesystem to be read-only, then "I/O hang" will loop to rehandle=20
the requests for a period time(ex. 5 second) until the requests
not return EIO(when backend storage link recovered).

In addition to the function as above, "I/O hang" also can sent event to=20
libvirt after backend storage status changed.

configure methods:
1. "I/O hang" ability can be configured for each disk as a disk attribute=
.
2. "I/O hang" timeout value also can be configured for each disk, when=20
storage link not recover in timeout value,
 =C2=A0=C2=A0 "I/O hang" will disable rehandle I/O requests and return EI=
O to Guest.


Are you interested in the feature?=C2=A0 I intend to push this feature to=
=20
qemu org, what's your opinion?
