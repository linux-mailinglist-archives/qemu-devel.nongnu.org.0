AFAIK, we've never actually set expectations for what process a key
signing must use. Merely that key should be signed by one or more
people who are already QEMU maintainers. It is more or less up to
the person signing the key what hoops they want to jump through
before adding their signature.

So while physically meeting is a traditional standard, some might
be fine to do key signing verification over a video conference
system, especially if both sides already know each other by sight
after previous physical meetings.

Daniel
