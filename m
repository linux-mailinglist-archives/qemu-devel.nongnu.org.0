Hi Daniel,
As far as I know, there is currently no API for accessing oss-fuzz
results. We could use email-based scripts to parse the automated reports
(e.g.  [1]) and follow the links to automatically download crash-traces
and reproducers. However, accessing those requires a login through
google.com which might be tough to script against in a reliable way.

Assuming we have found a way to automatically download the binary fuzzer
reproducer, we should be able to automatically convert it into a qtest
reproducer that we could send to the right people. 
There are a few approaches I can think of to automatically identify the
maintainers to CC:
 1. Walk the stack-trace until we find the line likely responsible for
 the bug. This can be tricky, since the buggy line is often not the
 first line. E.g. from [2]
    #3 __GI___assert_fail assert.c:101
    #4 iov_from_buf_full util/iov.c:40
    #5 iov_from_buf iov.h:49
    #6 net_tx_pkt_update_ip_checksums hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c:139
    #7 e1000e_setup_tx_offloads hw/net/e1000e_core.c:638

  Do we cc the iov maintainer, the net_tx_pkt maintainer, or the e1000e
  maintainer? Might be tough to figure out automatically.

 2. git bisect until we find the commit where the reproducer started to
 crash and CC everyone who signed-off or reviewed that commit and who is
 in MAINTAINERS. This is also not a silver bullet, since reproducers
 might stop working due to reasons unrelated to the bug: e.g.  the MMIO
 range for a device changed, so the qtest reproducer now interacts with
 the wrong addresses, or the bug was obscured by another bug.
