I agree - this is definitely seems like a problem if memory is being remove=
d,
but I don=E2=80=99t see how a virtqueue thread may have an outdated view of=
 memory
in the hot-add case.

libvhost-user now supports the REPLY_ACK feature, so that on hot-add qemu
will wait for a response from the backend, confirming the new memory was
successfully mapped in, before returning from vhost_user_set_mem_table(). I=
f
the new memory is mapped in by the backend before the ram is exposed to the
guest, how could a virtqueue thread receive operations on missing memory?
