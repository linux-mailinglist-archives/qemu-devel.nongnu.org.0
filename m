Thanks for following up on this; indeed it has been my remaining open
question in this thread.

I attempted to investigate a bit myself a few days ago, and indeed I can
now find the commit hash "679dd1a95" in my bash history.

So... If I can somehow query the QEMU machine type version -- or
emulator version? -- inside the guest, I'm perfectly happy using that. I
don't need dynamic detection specifically for this feature, I just need
something to deduce the feature from.

The problem is that the "possible CPU count" determination would run in
OVMF in every case, regardless of whether OVMF was built with -D
SMM_REQUIRE, and regardless of board type (q35 vs. i440fx). Requiring
QEMU v2.7.0 or later just for booting OVMF would be a bit steep.

So the idea is:
- check (somehow) if QEMU has the modern hotplug register block
  - available: great, now set the boot CPU count and the possible CPU
               count independently of each other
  - otherwise: set both values to the boot CPU count (which we can fetch
               from fw_cfg, like we've always done)

Perfect!

Basically this is prepending two "write 0 to selector register" steps to
what I suspected. I certainly couldn't figure out the "switch to modern"
step, and whether initializing the selector to something valid was
needed at boot. Now I know. :) Thanks!

Dynamically detecting the presence of the GET_CPU_ID command is not
important. That's because GET_CPU_ID is for a new use case (CPU hotplug
with SMM), which has never worked before. So we can't regress it.

We'll just modify the OvmfPkg/README file to spell out the minimum
machine type requirement:

  don't try to hotplug a CPU when running OVMF built with SMM_REQUIRE,
  unless your machine type is pc-q35-4.2+

which is exactly what we did for base SMM:

  * The minimum required QEMU machine type is "pc-q35-2.5".

The "possible CPU count" determination is more risky because that will
modify a code path that's active on every boot, in every possible
environment.

I think I can rework my OVMF series for the "possible CPU count"
fetching now.

Thank you!
Laszlo
