Honestly, I do not think the current model has worked very well for some
time; especially for larger series where I, for one, has felt that my
work was largely ignored due to a lack of designated reviewers. Things
only picked up when Beata, Maxim and Philippe started reviewing my
series - maybe out of pity or because I was bombing the list, I don't
know ;)

We've also seen good patches from Andrzej linger on the list for quite a
while, prompting a number of RESENDs. I only recently allocated more
time and upped my review game, but I hope that contributors feel that
stuff gets reviewed in a timely fashion by now.

Please understand that this is in NO WAY a criticism of Keith who
already made it very clear to me that he did not have a lot time to
review, but only ack the odd patch.

I would be happy to step up (officially) to help maintain the device
with Keith and review on a daily basis, and my position can support
this.

I don't think there is any reason to by-pass your tree. I think the
volume would need to increase even further for that to make sense.
