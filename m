I've answered this already with link to that thread here:

Which also had a proposed solution to the problem that you could try to 
implement, in particular see this message:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/20200218171702.979F074637D@zero.eik.bme.hu/#2375124

amd Richard's reply immediately below that. In short to optimise FPU 
emulation we would either find a way to compute inexact flag quickly 
without reading the FPU status (this may not be possible) or somehow get 
status from the FPU but the obvious way of claring the flag and reading 
them after each operation is too slow. So maybe using exceptions and only 
clearing when actually there's a change could be faster.

As to how to use exceptions see this message in above thread:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-03/msg00005.html

But that's only to show how to hook in an exception handler what it does 
needs to be implemented. Then tested and benchmarked.

I still don't know where are the extensive PPC floating point tests to use 
for checking results though as that was never answered.

I still don't get why can't we use hardware via exception handler to 
detect flags for us and why do we only use hardfloat in some corner cases. 
If reading the status is too costly then we could mirror it in a global 
which is set by an FP exception handler. Shouldn't that be faster? Is 
there a reason that can't work?
