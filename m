The CLI uses many, many languages.  The string visitor's language may
well be among them; can't tell offhand.

It happens to work in this case, because the JSON number returned by
qom-get happens to get parsed the right way by qom-set.

Is this the case for all properties where qom-set isn't deadly due to
issue 2.?  Nobody knows.

The string visitor feels like a quick hack to get something that is
human-friendly.  It provides just enough functionality for its initial
uses.  The trouble is new uses that violate its restrictions are hard to
spot.

In my opinion, what we're really missing a replacement of the
ill-conceived string visitor.  The less it's used, the better.

Since a replacement isn't being worked on, we may have to make it less
dangerous to use.  Patches welcome.

If the string visitor is used there.  Nobody knows.

Yes, HMP should be human-friendly.  Not at any cost, though; I reiterate
my conviction that this is an unadvisable risk.

A crash is the most unfriendly response of all.
