Public bug reported:

The code at line 202 in hw/ide/core.c
 (https://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dhw/ide/core.c;#l201)
hard codes bit 13 set.  However, get_physical_block_exp() can and may retur=
n 0, which is a valid response. If get_physical_block_exp() does return zer=
o, bit 13 should not be set.

ATAPI8 states (Section 7.17.7.73):
 "Bit 13 of word 106 shall be set to one to indicate that the device has mo=
re than one logical sector per physical sector"

and gives the examples:
  Bits (3:0): 0 =3D 2^0 =3D 1 logical sector per physical sector
  Bits (3:0): 1 =3D 2^1 =3D 2 logical sector per physical sector
  Bits (3:0): 2 =3D 2^2 =3D 4 logical sector per physical sector
  Bits (3:0): 3 =3D 2^3 =3D 8 logical sector per physical sector

Therefore, if bit 13 is set, bits 3:0 must be greater than zero.

If get_physical_block_exp() returns zero then there is a 1:1 ratio and
bit 13 must be 0.

Just my opinion.

Thanks,
Ben
