They can't manage the export name either, but apparently the default
that libvirt uses suits them.

I can add possibility to name the actual backup output bitmap
arbitrarily. Obviously the user then has to pass a sensible name of a
non existant bitmap to proceed.

Making both configurable at the same time may be worth doing as it will
be basically the same code.
