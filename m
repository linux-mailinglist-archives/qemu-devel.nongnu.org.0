The env var is intended to only be set by a developer.  The developer is responsible
for sending SIGCONT, not libvirt.  libvirt does not need to understand the semantics
of QEMU_PAUSE.

For libvirt, the developer would add this to the domain definition file, so it only
applies to that domain:

<qemu:commandline>
   <qemu:env name='QEMU_PAUSE' value='1'/>
</qemu:commandline>

The command line option is sufficient most of the time and I would be happy to get
at least that.  The env var is even better, and if I do not push it, someone else
will!

pause stops the qemu process earlier, so more can be debugged before it occurs.
With preconfig, qemu is still running its event loop and may respond to external
events such as monitor requests, which may be undesirable.
