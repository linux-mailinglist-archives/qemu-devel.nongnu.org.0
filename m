Yeah, I think it was meant to say:

if (s == bus->ifs[1] && !s->blk)

(But I don't know why it was important to guard device1 specifically. 
Knowledge lost to the sands of time.)

By the way, the correct terms are "device0" and "device1" and have been 
since at least ATA2. I believe ATA1 used the terms "disk0" and "disk1". 
"Primary" and "Secondary" are used to refer to the controllers, not the 
devices.

- Primary
   - device0
   - device1
- Secondary
   - device0
   - device1

Thanks for coming to my TED talk!

I think so. From what I understand, two drives on a single channel both 
receive all of the same register update commands, including the "SELECT" 
register, which has a bit devoted to which drive we have selected.

When we write to the COMMAND register, only the selective drive should 
actually respond to it.

so what I expect happens on real machines:

- You select device0
- You write to a bunch of registers
- You issue a command
- Nobody responds.
