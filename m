Thank you, Philippe, those are great ideas.  I have copied them
to the Avocado+QEMU Trello board so we don't forget about them:

Ouch.  This shouldn't happen even with no explicit --offline
option.  Failure to download artifacts shouldn't make tests
report failure.

This sounds nice and useful, but I don't know how to make the
interface for this usable.

I only have one concern, here: I don't think we have the
bandwidth to start maintaining a stable external Python API.
Users of those packages will need to be aware that future
versions of the modules might have incompatible APIs.

Sounds like a good idea.

I don't remember anything specific right now.  Thanks again!
