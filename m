I've looked into it again and changed my mind. There are at least the following
functions that the Artist chip does before a Read/Write is passed to/from VRAM:

- endianess conversion (actually configurable via some register, but i don't
  know how and hardwired it depending on CMAP / FB access)

- The Address passed on the System bus are the X/Y coordinates added to the FB
  base address in the selected buffer instead of the VRAM offset for pixel data.
  I think that's configurable via the some registers, but i don't know how.
  Unfortunately there's absolutely no documentation about Artist available and
  everything was developed by reverse engineering.

- bitmap to Byte/Word conversion (not implemented yet for the VRAM window, only
  for the I/O register window)

So in my opinion it's way to much effort to squeeze all of that into the memory
space, and it is not really a Memory range that's just behind a bus bridge.

Regards
Sven
