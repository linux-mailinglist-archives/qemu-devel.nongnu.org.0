Hi Jan,

Who/what is the "user"? I guess this simply means that the State Table
is read-only and only the hypervisor can update the table entries?

The host's mappable page size? I guess the guest's page size doesn't
matter here.

What does relocatable mean in this context?

The Interrupt Control register has not be defined yet at this point in
the spec. Maybe you can rearrange this or include a reference to the
section on the Interrupt Control register.

This last sentence is hard to parse.

I guess the flow is:

1. Guest sets Interrupt Control Bit 0 to 1 to enable interrupts from a
   peer.
2. Peer writes doorbell and the hypervisor clears Interrupt Control Bit
   0 and raises the interrupt.
3. The guest's interrupt handler is scheduled at a later point in time.
   If any additional doorbell writes occur then will not result in
   additional interrupts until the guest sets Interrupt Control again.

Does this mean the peer still takes a vmexit writing to the doorbell
register but the hypervisor ignores the write?

VIRTIO exposes whether notifications are desired in shared memory. That
way the peer can skip the doorbell write entirely (saving a vmexit).
This is a fast approach for software device implementations (slow for
hardware implementations because they would need to do a DMA read).

This paragraph is confusing. There seem to be two concepts:

1. Relocatable memory. Placing shared memory at a fixed addresses
   eliminates the need for address translation. But this seems like a
   security issue if a peer can make me access an arbitrary address, why
   not just use relative addresses from the start of the shared memory
   region?

2. Location of shared memory. BAR 2 is a regular PCI bar and the memory
   is located on the device. In the non-BAR 2 case I think the spec says
   the shared memory is located in guest RAM instead?

Isn't the PBA just used for masked MSI-X interrupts? That is a standard
MSI-X feature.

On a minimal system that doesn't used masking it makes sense to strip
down the implementation, but I think the spec should allow for PCI
compliance.

Is that "either MMIO or I/O" or "MMIO and/or I/O"?

Drivers and devices will have to implement both anyway to be compatible
with all other devices and drivers, respectively. But allowing both MMIO
and I/O at the same time ensures that a device will work with any
driver.

Can "page size" be replaced with a specific value like 4 KB? In general
devices shouldn't know about CPU MMU page sizes because they vary.

What is the purpose of the ID?

This is a global interrupt enable/disable for all vectors?

Physical devices have no control over CPU memory ordering. Normally the
drivers have the necessary memory barriers. Why is it the device's
responsibility to do this in IVSHMEM v2?

Does this mean drivers using INTx must compare the state table entries
for their peers on each interrupt to differentiate from doorbell events?
That seems inefficient.

If I understand correctly the reason for creating IVSHMEM v2 is to
support non-VIRTIO devices? If you just want VIRTIO devices then IVSHMEM
v2 + VIRTIO is more complex than a pure VIRTIO solution. But if you
don't want VIRTIO then IVSHMEM + a minimal device can be simpler than
VIRTIO.
