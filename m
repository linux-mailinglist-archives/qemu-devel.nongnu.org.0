This is qemuBuildFloppyCommandLineControllerOptions().  I'm not sure I
follow the logic there.

Two compatibility issues are relevant to floppies:

* Onboard isa-fdc

  We dropped the onboard isa-fdc for certain machine types (commit
  ea96bc629c "i386: drop FDC in pc-q35-2.4+ if neither it nor floppy
  drives are wanted", v2.4.0).  To get one, use -device isa-fdc of
  -drive if=3Dfloppy,...

  The upstream machine types are pc-q35-2.4 or later.  Downstreams are
  free to do the same for their machine types.

  qemuDomainMachineNeedsFDC() returns true for x86 machine types other
  than pc-q35-{1.,2.0,2.1,2.2,2.3}*

  Your "when the machine type is pc-q35-2.4 or earlier" appears to be
  off by one.

  When libvirt decides to use -device isa-fdc, it sensibly puts the
  driveA=3D... and driveB=3D... bits there rather than in -global isa-fdc..=
.

  Libvirt still uses -global for machine types with an onboard isa-fdc.

* -device floppy

  We support configuring floppy drives with -device (commit a92bd191a4
  "fdc: Move qdev properties to FloppyDrive", v2.8.0).

  This permits

    -device isa-fdc,FDC-OPTS...
    -device floppy unit=3D0,drive=3DBACKEND,FLOPPY-OPTS...

  in addition to the old

    -device isa-fdc,driveA=3DBACKEND,FDC_OPTS...

  or the even older

    -global isa-fdc.driveA=3DBACKEND,FDC_OPTS...

  which both rely on black magic in device isa-fdc to automatically
  create the floppy device.

  Same for driveB / unit=3D0, of course.

  I expect us to deprecate isa-fdc's driveA and driveB some day.

  Its replacement lets you avoid -global even for machine types with an
  onboard isa-fdc.

  To detect it, check whether device "floppy" exists.

> * NVRAM
>
>   -global spapr-nvram.reg=3D0xnnnn

Onboard device of the pseries-* machine type family.

Our means to configure onboard devices are weak.  We sidestepped this
for isa-fdc by taking it off the board, and thus make -device work.

I investigated doing the same for onboard flash memory, but Paolo
convinced me to do something else instead: add machine properties that
alias the onboard devices' properties.  Commit ebc29e1beab explains all
this, if you're curious.

If we do the same here, we can replace -global spapr-nvram.reg=3D... by
something like -machine nvram-reg=3D...

Solution: wait for libvirt to notice QEMU lacking -device is long dead
and buried.

Onboard device, same solution as for NVRAM.

Note that the board uses either isa-pit or kvm-pit, depending on
configuration.  Might complicate things a bit.

Onboard devices, same solution as for NVRAM, I guess.

Mostly "not yet", I think.
