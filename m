I was originally using Peter's branch but later I got to know there
was some patch conflicts between my patch series and what was already
applied in the RISC-V queue. Hence I switched to rebase my series on
"for-master" since v4.

I will rebase my patch series again, and send out a v8 (hopefully the
last version) soon.
