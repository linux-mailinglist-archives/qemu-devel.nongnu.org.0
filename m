Public bug reported:


guest os: windows server standard 2016
qemu agent version 100.0.0

os supports trimming
path mounted image does not support trimming

C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify
NTFS DisableDeleteNotify =3D 0
ReFS DisableDeleteNotify =3D 1


[@ ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\=
Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is in=
valid. (0x89000001)"}]}}


Looks like the fstrim does not like/check images mounted on a path? Nor det=
ects if image trimming is supported. xxxx is a ReFS mounted image without t=
rimming support. =


If I enable trimming on the ReFS image, and configure it win2016, the
result is still the same.


C:\Users\Administrator>fsutil behavior query disabledeletenotify

[root@c03 ~]# virsh qemu-agent-command vps-xxx '{"execute":"guest-fstrim"}'
{"return":{"paths":[{"path":"C:\\"},{"path":"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\=
Exchange Server\\V15\\Mailbox\\xxxx\\","error":"The given volume path is in=
valid. (0x89000001)"}]}}

PS. tried this on a win 2016 std server with just one fs, no problems
then.
