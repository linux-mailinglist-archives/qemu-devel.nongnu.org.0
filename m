While it is hackish at first glance, the more I think about it the less hackish it
becomes.  The thing is - we're talking about different behavour of some program when
it sees different argv[0]. We can just as well use the same mechanism to support this.

I don't care either way or the other, and I don't see the Laurent's one as better,
either. It's a long-term issue where quite some bullets has been spent already and
quite some spears has been broken. I come across a solution which actually works and
let others who waited for this issue to be solved to do their work.

At the very least, the one requiring kernel patch does not work on current distributions,
while my version works just fine, and we'll keep it in debian for now since it allows
to unbreak quite some other things. If qemu upstream will take another approach it is
entirely fine with me (after all that's why I sent an RFC in the first place, - to show
another (at least one) possible solution and to hear comments, and to develop something
which is good in the end). Hopefully we'll be able to switch to a better solution once
it's settled and will be available within current distributions.

Thanks,
