I don't think you're following my point.  It's not about what's
possible to be done, but what's the baseline of the test environment
we want to have.

It's unwise to attempt to compare the results of a test that run under
a container with "arbitrary host resources" exposed to it, to the
results of a test running on the host without the container layer.
Think, for instance, if QE would be willing to do the former only, and
sign off on it, when customers are using the later.

I hope this makes the point clearer.
