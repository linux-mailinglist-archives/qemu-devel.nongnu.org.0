That depends on what happens for transactions that are off the end
of the range, I suppose -- usually a 32-bit CPU system design will
for obvious reasons not put ram or devices over 4GB, so if the
behaviour for a DMA access past 4GB is the same whether there's
nothing mapped there or whether the access is just off-the-end then
it doesn't matter how QEMU models it. I haven't tested to see what an
off-the-end transaction does, though.

I'm inclined to say that since 'hwaddr' is always a 64-bit type we should
stick to having the system memory address space be64 bits.

Historically I think it was more "there is only one address space and
this is it": it wasn't the first CPU's address space, it was what *every*
CPU saw, and what every DMA device used, because the APIs
pre-MemoryRegion had no concept of separate address spaces at all.
So system-memory starts off as a way to continue to provide those
old semantics in an AddressSpace/MemoryRegion design, and we've
then gradually increased the degree to which different transaction
masters use different AddressSpaces. Typically system-memory
today is often "whatever's common to all CPUs" (and then you
overlay per-CPU devices etc on top of that), but it might have
less stuff than that in it (I have a feeling the arm-sse SoCs put
less stuff into system-memory than you might expect). How much
freedom you have to not put stuff into the system-memory address
space depends on things like whether the guest architecture's
target/foo code or some DMA device model on the board still uses
APIs that don't specify the address space and instead use the
system address space.
