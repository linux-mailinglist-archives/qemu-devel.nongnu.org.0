Checking if I understood: you are proposing to keep running the flaky on=20
Travis which might get failing most of time (but Travis won't flag=20
error). Until someone fix them and remove the "flaky" tag so putting=20
them on the (virtual) "stable" tests group? If so, I am ok with this=20
approach while we don't have a better solution in place.

I just realized that test runner is another thing in Avocado's jargon:
https://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/70.0/GetStartedGuide.html#run=
ning-tests-with-an-external-runner

Ok, I'm looking forward those improvements on Avocado API. :)
