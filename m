Is there an established pattern for how Qemu 'gets' things that are done in secure-world?
For PSCI the kernel does it, but this obviously doesn't scale to something like OP-TEE.

Ideally we'd get the reference implementation (from ATF) in some form that is easy to use...

(this is your use case. Its origin was just symmetry with EL3<->EL2)

Or get stuck in debug-state (for which we mask SError), power-management, the vectors or
somewhere weird, like KVM's world-switch.


If you just want to kill the OS if its sort-of-alive, there is another trick:

Synchronous exceptions can't be masked because they are caused by the instruction pointed
to by the ELR. You can't inject an emulated data-abort unless the ELR points to an
instruction that accesses memory, but...

synchronous external abort for instruction fetch is something that  could happen at any
time. If you have v8.2 you can make the severity uncontainable for extra points.

On real hardware, this would be as if this instruction missed in the i-cache, then got an
abort from the PoU-cache. The PoU-cache must have suffered some metadata corruption to
report an uncontained error. On real hardware its very likely the next instruction would
suffer the same fate, but linux should put up a good show of trying to panic().

Yes. By sort-of-alive it needs to be making some kind of progress. If the CPU is spinning
through the vectors (because some joker unmapped them), all bets are off.


Thanks,

James
