Oh, nice, will do. (Not sure how useful this was in the text document,
anyway.)

Hm... I think this is supposed to be:
- header ("Example 1: ...")
- config
- explanation why this is a valid config

Maybe a table? Tony, any preferences?

I don't think so.

Nod. The indentation in the document was a bit inconsistent, it just
did not matter before.

Not sure if a definition list for something that is basically a list of
examples makes sense. Will check how it renders.

That's probably a good idea, will check.

Will also check, I mostly converted this document via a whack-a-mole
approach.

Yep, I'll check if there is anything else that should be fixed-width.
