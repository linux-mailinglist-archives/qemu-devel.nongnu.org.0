The Error API evolved recently.  Please peruse the big comment in
include/qapi/error.h.  If still unsure, don't hesitate to ask here.

Correct.  Quote the big comment:

 * Call a function aborting on errors:
 *     foo(arg, &error_abort);
 * This is more concise and fails more nicely than
 *     Error *err =3D NULL;
 *     foo(arg, &err);
 *     assert(!err); // don't do this

Quote the big comment:

 * Call a function treating errors as fatal:
 *     foo(arg, &error_fatal);
 * This is more concise than
 *     Error *err =3D NULL;
 *     foo(arg, &err);
 *     if (err) { // don't do this
 *         error_report_err(err);
 *         exit(1);
 *     }

Terminating the process is generally fine during initial startup,
i.e. before the guest runs.

It's generally not fine once the guest runs.  Errors need to be handled
more gracefully then.  A QMP command, for instance, should fail cleanly,
propagating the error to the monitor core, which then sends it to the
QMP client, and loops to process the next command.

Realize methods must not use &error_fatal.  Instead, they should clean
up and fail.

"Clean up" is the part we often neglect.  The big advantage of
&error_fatal is that you don't have to bother :)

Questions?
