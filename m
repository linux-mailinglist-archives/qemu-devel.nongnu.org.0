Public bug reported:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a new device along with a qtest to exercise it.
2. Run make check-qtest. It passes.
3. Revert the commit that added the device and qtest.
4. Run make check-qtest again. It now fails because the device no longer ex=
ists, but the test is somehow still there even though the source files are =
gone and it's not mentioned in tests/qtest/meson.build.

After running make clean, make check-qtest passes again.
