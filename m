We may try to, but it looks something is broken for floppies.

The bug only came to my attention yesterday, so I haven't got a full
test case yet, but the half that I already have fails for floppy. I'll
look into this, but it was more important to me to get at least the
scsi-cd fix into 4.1.

Most of them aren't relevant in this context because this is a problem
with removable media, and most devices don't support that. So as far as
I know all we need to check is floppy, ATAPI and SCSI CD-ROM.

Floppy is special because it's the only read-write device that supports
removable media (and you can insert a read-only floppy after ejecting a
read-write one or vice versa). CDs can be simpler because they are
always read-only.
