Hi Andrew, please forgive my carelessness, I forget to add the changelog =
here.
Actually v2 is slightly modified with a few fixes for compilation
warning and a commit message.

Yes, you are right.

The motivation is that there seems no other formal way than the CPPC
feature for arm64 to present cpu frequency info to the OS. However on
x86 platform we have the CPUID method to do that. Some of our VM customer=
s
and cloud developers want that information to do something. So we come up
with the virtual cpufreq device way.

If the guest is migrated to any host where the frequency is different,
a next read on the CPPC related register may return the new cpufreq info.

Maybe some userspace apps need it to do perf tuning or they
want to know the accurate cpu nominal frequency by using tools
like lshw.

We use the CPPC cpufreq way because we think this is a much more
standard way to do that.
