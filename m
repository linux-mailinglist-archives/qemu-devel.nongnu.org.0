This is exciting! The spec is clear enough that I feel I could start
writing a client/server. There is enough functionality here to implement
real-world devices. Can you share links to client/server
implementations?

It would be useful to introduce a standard way of enumerating,
launching, and controlling device emulation processes. That doesn't need
to be part of this specification document though. In vhost-user there
are conventions for command-line parameters, process lifecycle, etc that
make it easier for management tools to run device processes (the
"Backend program conventions" section in vhost-user.rst).

Please include a reference to the section below explaining how
versioning works.

Also, are there rules about noting versions when updating the spec? For
example:

  When making a change to this specification, the protocol version
  number must be included:

    The `foo` field contains ... Added in version 1.3.

vfio-user is shorted. Now is the best time to start consistently using
"vfio-user" as the name for this protocol. Want to drop the name
VFIO-over-socket?

Is there anything QEMU-specific about this protocol?

I think the scope of this protocol is more general and it could be
described as:

  allows device emulation in a separate process outside of a Virtual
  Machine Monitor (VMM).

(Or "emulator" instead of VMM, if you prefer.)

It's a little subtle here that "VFIO" means the Linux VFIO ioctl
interface. Expanding it a bit makes the rest of the text clearer:

  The `Linux VFIO ioctl
  interface
  <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html>`_ has
  been chosen as the base for this protocol for the following reasons:

In the long run only the last sentence in this paragraph needs to be in
the specification.

The proof of concept and QEMU-specific info is good to know for the
discussion right now, but I don't think this needs to be in the
specification.

Should the spec start consistently using "server" instead of various
terms like "virtual device process"?

> +* Sharing of virtual device memory with the guest for fast MMIO.

The VIRTIO spec restricts itself to the terms "device" and "driver" so
that the scope isn't too specific to virtualization of software devices.
I think the same might be good here because who knows how
VFIO-over-socket will be used in the future. Maybe it will be used
outside the context of traditional guests. For example, it's a great
interface for writing device emulation tests and fuzzers!

I suggest consistently using "client" (for the guest) and "server" (for
the device emulation process). That way the spec isn't focussed on a
specific use case.

This is a good place to be explicit about the protocol requirements:

Is file-descriptor passing necessary?

Is shared-memory necessary?

Is there always an in-band message-passing fallback for any operation
that can be optimized via fd passing?

By stating something about this in the spec it's easier to ensure that
the protocol continues to follow these design parameters in the future
when other people make modifications.

This paragraph about the QEMU implementation status can be dropped from

Can "UNIX-domain" be dropped here? If the protocol design is intended to
support other transports then it helps to avoid mentioning a specific
transport even if only AF_UNIX will be implemented in the beginning.

"Guest" is a virtualization term. "DMA Memory Configuration" and "DMA

VFIO calls them "device regions", which is clearer:
1. It cannot be confused with "DMA Memory Regions"
2. It allows for I/O space in additional to Memory space

I suggest using "device regions" consistently.

There is a version negotiation mechanism for making protocol changes.
I'm not sure there is any advantage to including the multiplexing header
now? I suggest keeping it simple and dropping the unused header.

The word "request" has not been used up to this point in the spec. What
does "request" mean here?

I'm not sure if this section is talking about vfio-user protocol message
exchanges (e.g. a client->server message followed by a server->client
message) or something else?

What about the ordering semantics at the vfio-user protocol level? For
example, if a client sends multiple VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP/UNMAP messages
then the order matters. What are the rules? I wonder if maybe
concurrency is a special case and really only applies to a subset of
protocol commands?

I'm not sure how a client would exploit parallelism in this protocol.
Can you give an example of a case where there would be multiple commands
pending on a single device?

No mention is made of recovering state or how disconnect maps to VFIO
device types (PCI, etc.). Does a disconnect mean that the device has
been reset?

Unicode issues? I see "????????" instead of the characters that were

Why is this command named VFIO_DEVICE_RESET and not
VFIO_USER_DEVICE_RESET?

I suggest dropping "16 byte" here because the table already shows this

Are Message IDs global or per-device?

Is_Reply and Dont_Reply are more self-explanatory to me, but this is
probably subjective.

The Device ID is always 0 and this message is sent just once regardless
of the number of devices? Please describe this explicitly so it's clear
that this message is per-session and not per-device.

There could also be a special NO_DEVICE (0xff) value but I don't think
it matters.

Is there a rationale for this field? In order to get to the point where
this JSON is parsed we must already implement the vfio-user protocol
(e.g. parse the header).

Is this message per-session instead of per-device?

This has implications on IOMMU semantics. Two different devices sharing
a connection have access to the same DMA memory?

What are the semantics of map/unmap with respect to mapping over
existing regions, unmapping a subset of an existing region, etc?

What are the concerns for MAP/UNMAP while the device is operational and
may be performing DMA? Should this command be combined into a single
VFIO_USER_SET_DMA_REGIONS command with Flags Bit 1 indicating Add/Delete
so that a single message can atomically add and delete DMA regions?

What is the format of the reply to this message?

The client does not know how much space capabilities need when sending
the request. Should the client send a 48-byte request and expect the
server to reply with a 48+ byte response?

This seems to be incorrect since the count field is 4 bytes but struct
iovec::iov_len is size_t (64-bit on 64-bit hosts).
