For now I would say not to worry about the PCI IRQ: the reason for discussing this
before was because we believed that if the controller was in native mode it must be
using the IRQ in PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE. But from yesterday's read of the specification
we know that PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE is never used by the device itself, and so given that
the existing via-ide device doesn't currently attempt to use the PCI IRQ in
via_ide_set_irq() then we should be good.

If someone had a machine somewhere that did use the PCI IRQ then it would need
investigation, but since there isn't then I don't see any need to do this now.

Okay thanks, that's useful to know.

I've done a quick grep of the source tree and AFAICT the only IDE controller that
tries to use the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE register is via-ide, which means this should be
fairly easy. In short:

1) Add qemu_irq legacy_irqs[2] into PCIIDEState

(You could argue that it should belong in a separate VIAIDEState, however quite a few
of the BMDMA controllers in QEMU don't have their own device state and just use
PCIIDEState. And whilst via-ide is the only one that currently needs support for
legacy IRQs, I think it's good to put it there in case other controllers need it in
future)

2) Add via_ide_initfn() to hw/ide/via.c and add qdev_init_gpio_out_named() with a
name of "legacy-irq" to it

3) Inline via_ide_init() into hw/mips/mips_fulong2e.c, changing pci_create_simple()
to pci_create() because the device shouldn't be realised immediately

4) In vt82c686b_southbridge_init use qdev_connect_gpio_out_named() to connect
legacy_irq[0] to 8259 IRQ 14 and legacy_irq[1] to 8259 IRQ 15, and then realise the
device

5) Remove the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE logic from via_ide_set_irq() and instead just do
qemu_set_irq() on legacy_irq[0] (in theory I guess it should be legacy_irq[n] but it
seems that both drives on MIPS and Pegasos both use IRQ 14).


ATB,

Mark.
