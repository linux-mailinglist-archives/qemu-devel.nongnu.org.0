It isn't clear to me that we have a consitent plan for how we intend
libvhost-user to develop & what it is permitted to use.  What information
I see in the source code and in this thread are contradictory.

For example, in the text quoted above:

  "libvhost-user is supposed to be indepdent from the main QEMU code."

which did match my overall understanding too. At the top of libvhost-user.c
there is a comment

   /* this code avoids GLib dependency */

but a few lines later it does

  #include "qemu/atomic.h"
  #include "qemu/osdep.h"
  #include "qemu/memfd.h"

and in the Makefile we link it to much of QEMU util code:

  libvhost-user.a: $(libvhost-user-obj-y) $(util-obj-y) $(stub-obj-y)

this in turn pulls in GLib code, and looking at symbols we can see
over 100 GLib functions used:

  $ nm ./libvhost-user.a | grep 'U g_' | sort | uniq | wc -l
  128

And over 200 QEMU source object files included:

  $ nm ./libvhost-user.a | grep '.o:' | sort | wc -l
  224

So unless I'm missing something, we have lost any independance from
both QEMU and GLib code that we might have had in the past.

Note this also has licensing implications, as I expect this means that
via the QEMU source objects it pulls in, libvhost-user.a has become
a GPLv2-only combined work, not a GPLv2-or-later combined work.
