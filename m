I checked with xfs on my computer. I'm not very familiar with that
filesystem so I was using the default options and I didn't tune
anything.

What I got with my tests (using fio):

- Using extent_size_hint didn't make any difference in my test case (I
  do see a clear difference however with the test case described in
  commit ffa244c84a).

- preallocation=off is still faster than preallocation=metadata. If I
  disable handle_alloc_space() (so there is no ZERO_RANGE used) then it
  is much slower.

- With preallocation=falloc I get the same results as with
  preallocation=metadata.

- preallocation=full is the fastest by far.
