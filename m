That a little undocumented hack that will disappear one day.
Its because the driver currently doesn't keep a copy of the master key,
and instead only keeps ciper objects, often from outside libraries,
and in theory these objects might even be implemented in hardware so that
master key might be not in memory at all, so I kind of don't want yet
to keep it in memory.
Thus when doing the key management, I need to retrieve the master key again=
,
similar to how it is done on image opening. I use the same secret as was us=
ed for opening,
but in case the keys were changed already, that secret might not work anymo=
re.
Thus I added this parameter to specify basically the old password, which is=
 reasonable
when updating passwords.
I usually omit this hack in the discussions as it is orthogonal to the rest=
 of the API.
