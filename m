When compression is involved, 64k is the minimum block size at the
qcow2 layer, but the qemu NBD layer is relying on the generic block
core code to do RMW on anything smaller than that.  If the RMW doesn't
work, we may have a bug in the block layer.  Even if it does appear to
work, I'm not sure whether the block layer is able to recompress a
cluster - it may be that the act of RMW on a partially-written
initially-compressed cluster causes that cluster to no longer be
compressed, at which point, while your write succeeded, you are no
longer getting any compression.

So, while it is a nice QoI feature of qemu-nbd that we can rely on the
block layer RMW to accept client requests that were smaller than the
advertised minimum block size, I still think the advertised size is
correct, and that the client is in violation of the spec if it is
requesting but then not honoring the advertised size.  And yes, while
it is a pain to hack nbdcopy to pay more attention to block sizing, I
think in the long run it will be worth it.
