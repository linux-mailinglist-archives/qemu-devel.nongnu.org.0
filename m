So, QEMU is trying to emulate actual hardware. None of this
looks to me like what GICv3 hardware does... If you want to
have the virt board send an interrupt, do it the usual way
by wiring up a qemu_irq from some device to the GIC, please.
(More generally, there is no concept of an "NMI" in the GIC;
there are just interrupts at varying possible guest-programmable
priority levels.)
