Right. Just to be sure, I just double-checked with:

... -device virtio-blk,drive=baddrive,bootindex=1 \
    -device virtio-blk,drive=gooddrive

and indeed, the s390-ccw bios only checks the "baddrive" here and
refuses to boot.

Thanks!

Sure. We™ should/could maybe also add some more documentation to

 https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/target-s390x.html

to make it more clear to the "unexperienced" qemu-system-s390x users
that "bootindex" is the preferred / architected way of booting there.

Ok, I'll try to state that more clearly in the cover letter of v2.
