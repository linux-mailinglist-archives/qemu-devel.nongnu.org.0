Regarding the pre-patch code:

My understanding is that the memcpy() could be reached with a
guest-originated "addr" even if "vdev->rom" was NULL. If that's the
case, then the pre-patch code invokes undefined behavior regardless of
memcpy(), because it performs pointer arithmetic on a null pointer (not
to mention that the type of that pointer is (void *)....)

Regarding the proposed change:

(addr < vdev->rom_size) requires that "vdev->rom_size" be positive. In
that case, I assume that

- "vdev->rom" is not NULL, and
-  MIN(size, vdev->rom_size - addr) bytes are "in range" for the object
allocated at "vdev->rom".

So from a memcpy() and range perspective, the patch looks OK. But
there's still a wart I dislike: we should never perform pointer
arithmetic on a (void*). I suggest casting (vdev->rom) to (uint8_t*) or
(unsigned char*) first.

Here's an excerpt from the ISO C99 standard:

-v-
6.5.6 Additive operators

Constraints

2 For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic type, or one
  operand shall be a pointer to an object type and the other shall have
  integer type. [...]
-^-

A "pointer-to-void" is not a "pointer to an object type", because "void"
is not an object type -- it is an incomplete type that cannot be completed:

-v-
6.2.5 Types

1 [...] Types are partitioned into object types (types that fully
  describe objects), function types (types that describe functions), and
  incomplete types (types that describe objects but lack information
  needed to determine their sizes).

[...]

19 The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete
   type that cannot be completed.
-^-

For a different illustration, (vdev->rom + addr) is equivalent to
&(vdev->rom[addr]) -- and we clearly can't have an "array of void".

This anti-pattern (of doing pointer arithmetic on (void*)) likely comes
from a guarantee that the standard does make, in the same "6.2.5 Types"
section:

-v-
27 A pointer to void shall have the same representation and alignment
   requirements as a pointer to a character type. 39) [...]

Footnote 39: The same representation and alignment requirements are
             meant to imply interchangeability as arguments to
             functions, return values from functions, and members of
             unions.
-^-

It does not extend to the "+" operator.

Thanks
Laszlo
