And by that I mean all XFS versions, as far as I can tell.  All details
are in the comment below.

We never noticed this problem because we only read the first number from
qemu-img info's "disk size" output -- and that is effectively useless,
because qemu-img prints a human-readable value (which generally includes
a decimal point).  That will be fixed in the next patch.

+# Test whether we are running on a broken XFS version.  There is this
+# bug:
+
+# $ rm -f foo
+# $ touch foo
+# $ block_size=3D4096 # Your FS's block size
+# $ fallocate -o $((block_size / 2)) -l $block_size foo

+#         1: [8..15]: hole
+#
+# The problem is that the XFS driver rounds down the offset and
+# rounds up the length to the block size, but independently.  As
+# such, it only allocates the first block in the example above,
+# even though it should allocate the first two blocks (because our
+# request is to fallocate something that touches both the first
+# two blocks).
+#
+# This means that when you then write to the beginning of the
+# second block, the disk usage of the first two blocks grows.
+#
+# That is precisely what fallocate() promises, though: That when you
+# write to an area that you have fallocated, no new blocks will have
+# to be allocated.
