Hi Phil,

Sorry for the delay, I=E2=80=99ve been traveling.

I considered something like this approach and I think it could work. Ultimat=
ely, I opted not to go that route for a few reasons:
- duplicated CFI tables and other state waste (a small amount of) memory whe=
n the flash chips are the same (the usual case in my limited experience)
- it adds an extra layer of read/write calls plus recombining from/splitting=
 into the component parts
- duplicated timers firing to walk the programming/erasing state machine for=
ward for each chip
- the firmware or data stored in the chips is likely already interleaved nec=
essitating either splitting it up before use or adding functionality to a lo=
wer layer to split it (as you=E2=80=99ve suggested here)

None of the above seem like a big deal separately or together but I didn=E2=80=
=99t find the advantages of this approach to be sufficiently compelling to j=
ustify it. Namely, it allows using a heterogeneous set of flash chips to imp=
lement a logical device.

Nevertheless, if that=E2=80=99s the route you think is best, I have no objec=
tions.

Cheers,

Steve
