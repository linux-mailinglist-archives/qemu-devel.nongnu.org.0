Hi!

There is one corner case this breaks.
In qemu 4.1.0, there is no way to specify audiodev for a sound device, sp=
ecifying it
fails with error.
So some of my machines have audiodev (which is miles better that using ol=
d env variables)
but also have sound devices without audiodev reference since this wasn't =
supported.


In what will be qemu 4.2, you must specify it, thus this kind of breaks b=
ackward compatibility.
Maybe we can have audiodev reference optional for a version or two?

This is just a minor itch, as otherwise the sound improvements are really=
 good. The days
of installing that old realtek driver are finally gone :-)


Another thing I noted, that there is no way for pulseaudio audiodev to sp=
ecify the 'client name',
it always shows up in pavucontrl as the socket path to the server.=20
Thus if I added two PA audiodevs, I can't really distinguish between them=
.
The in|out.name=3D seems to specify the pulseaudio source/sink to connect=
 to, which is not the same.
