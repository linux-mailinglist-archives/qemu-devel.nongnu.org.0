hi Paolo,
thanks for your reply and never mind :)

But there's one thing I just can't figure out the reason and eagerly need
your guide.

why do we have to convert all .write operations to .write_with_attrs and
return MEMTX_ERROR? because of the handling of writes to read-only region?

however, it seems that all regions have to handle this case, so ultimately
we have to convert all .write to .write_with_attrs and there would be no
.write operations any more?

Thanks
Yan
