Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64: hw/ide/core.c:685: ide_cancel_dma_sync: Assertion
  `s->bus->dma->aiocb =3D=3D NULL' failed.

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Since upgrading to QEMU 2.8.0, my Windows 7 64-bit virtual machines
  started crashing due to the assertion quoted in the summary failing.
  The assertion in question was added by commit 9972354856 ("block: add
  BDS field to count in-flight requests").  My tests show that setting
  discard=3Dunmap is needed to reproduce the issue.  Speaking of
  reproduction, it is a bit flaky, because I have been unable to come up
  with specific instructions that would allow the issue to be triggered
  outside of my environment, but I do have a semi-sane way of testing that
  appears to depend on a specific initial state of data on the underlying
  storage volume, actions taken within the VM and waiting for about 20
  minutes.

  Here is the shortest QEMU command line that I managed to reproduce the
  bug with:

      qemu-system-x86_64 \
          -machine pc-i440fx-2.7,accel=3Dkvm \
          -m 3072 \
          -drive file=3D/dev/lvm/qemu,format=3Draw,if=3Dide,discard=3Dunmap=
 \
  	-netdev tap,id=3Dhostnet0,ifname=3Dtap0,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno,vhos=
t=3Don \
          -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet0 \
  	-vnc :0

  The underlying storage (/dev/lvm/qemu) is a thin LVM snapshot.

  QEMU was compiled using:

      ./configure --python=3D/usr/bin/python2.7 --target-list=3Dx86_64-soft=
mmu
      make -j3

  My virtualization environment is not really a critical one and
  reproduction is not that much of a hassle, so if you need me to gather
  further diagnostic information or test patches, I will be happy to help.
