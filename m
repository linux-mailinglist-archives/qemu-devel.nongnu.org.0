I don't agree. 

If the user does not specify any specific interrupt mode, we should favor 
the faster one. 

Here is the current matrix (with this patch) for guests running on an 
old KVM, that is without KVM XIVE support. Let's discuss on what we
want. 

                        kernel_irqchip

           (default) 
ic-mode     allowed           off            on 

dual        XICS KVM       XICS emul.(3)   XICS KVM         (default mode)
xics        XICS KVM       XICS emul.      XICS KVM    
xive        XIVE emul.(1)  XIVE emul.     QEMU failure (2)


(1) QEMU warns with "warning: kernel_irqchip requested but unavailable: 
    IRQ_XIVE capability must be present for KVM" 
(2) QEMU fails with "kernel_irqchip requested but unavailable: 
    IRQ_XIVE capability must be present for KVM" 
(3) That is wrong I think, we should get XIVE emulated.


what you would want is XIVE emulation when ic-mode=dual and 
kernel_irqchip=allowed, which is the behavior with this patch (but there
are reboot bugs)

Yes. It's another problem around the way we cleanup the allocated resources.
It should be another patch.

If the host (KVM) doesn't have a capability, what is the point of trying 
to use it if we can do better. I know you are considering KVM/QEMU as a
whole but who would run with kernel_irqchip=off ?

'dual' mode means both and the user is not requesting XIVE. We are changing 
the priority of choices from :

 1. KVM XIVE
 2. QEMU XIVE
 3. KVM XICS
 4. QEMU XICS

to:

 1. KVM XIVE
 2. KVM XICS
 3. QEMU XIVE
 4. QEMU XICS

which is better I think.
