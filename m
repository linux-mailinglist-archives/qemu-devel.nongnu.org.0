IMHO a vtable is fine for singleton objects. It is a generic way to
remove tight coupling between caller(s) and an implementation. Just
having 1 implementation doesn't invalidate the model.

I much prefer the code in the vtable patch version. The larger number of
lines of code doesn't bother me, because the code is really simple and
clear to read. IOW I prefer the clarity of the longer code, over the
shorter code with magic hidden behind it.
