It should work in the same way as it does for tcg right now (we return
-ENOSYS in the non-kvm flic as well). If you're not using irqfd,
everything will work just fine.

What about the following:

"If you are trying to use irqfd without a kernel irqchip, we will fail
with an error."

?

There probably won't be many people seeing anything like this, as I
guess most people will delegate the irqfd setup to libvirt anyway,
which will not turn off the kernel irqchip.
