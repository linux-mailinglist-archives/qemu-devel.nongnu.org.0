I believe it should be a python shell with added commands.

Simple things should be simple.
  e.g. adding a disk from a local file should be trivial.

Complex things can be complex - but it would be better if they were
simple.

  It's OK if the worst case of a blockdev is a bit hairy, but
  watch out for cases where the hairyness creeps in unnecessarily.

If the user screwsup, it should give an error that prompts the user
to the parameter they got wrong.

Output from commands should normally be pretty formatted (with an option
to display raw json for those needing it).
  e.g. that 'query-version' should give either just the package
  version (as info version currently does) or:
      4.2.50  Package: v4.2.0-1188-gd95a3885a9

We shouldn't lose any HMP commands that some people find useful
  Ditching HMP isn't an option until we've got almost all of it
  covered.
