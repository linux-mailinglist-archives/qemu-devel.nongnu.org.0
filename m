Please note: a new patch is in the works to extend the SCCB for the SCLP
response for RSCPI. This will help alleviate the issue of losing space 
for CPU
entries. The appropriate patch will be introduced at the beginning of this
series once it is ready for upstream.


Thanks for your patience and understanding,
- Collin
