Many big projects already use Meson, including SystemD and GNOME for
example. So I'd expect all modern distros would have standard
"best practices" defined for building projects using Meson by now.

Doing an out of tree build for autotools based projects doesn't take
much adaption by distros either from what we got in terms of feedback
when libvirt made the switch to force out-of-tree.
