This is a collection of misc patches for Linux user that I recently
accumulated from variuous sources. All of them originate from problems
observed on mips target. However, most of these changes actually
affect and fix linux-user problems on multiple targets.

There are three checkpatch warninhs and two checkpatch errors that
sould be ignored in the given circumstances.

NOTE: Two checkpatch errors and three warnings are false alarms.

v15->v16:

  - renamed statx->sys_statx

v14->v15:

  - removed inclusion of sys/stat.h from patch #1
  - a minor correction in the commit message for patch #3
  - amended patch #5 to reflect the kernel behavior wrt FPE

v13->v14:

  - several minor corrections in commit messages

v12->v13:

  - removed two patches that got accepted
  - simplified the patch on statx()
  - added a patch on TARGET_HAVE_ARCH_STRUCT_FLOCK
  - added a patch on fixing EXCP_FPE handling on MIPS

v11->v12:

  - used the preffered Laurent's email address for linux-user
  - added a note on checkpetch warnings and errors in the commit letter
 

v10->v11:

  - patch on <ADD|DROP>_MEMEBERSHIP basically reverted to its first
    version
  - corrected patch on statx()
  - added patch on strace support for statx()
  - added patch on fixing flock structure for MIPS O64 ABI

v9->v10:

  - improved commit messages for patches 2 and 3

v8->v9:

  - fixed build error on some systems related to SOL_ALG

v7->v8:

  - added a patch on setsockopt() option SOL_ALG

v6->v7:

  - fixed a build error for older kernels related to the patch on
    setsockopt() options
  - removed four patches that on the meantime got accepted into the
    main source tree

v5->v6:

  - fixed a mistake in patch #4
  - improved commit messages in patches #4 and #6

v4->v5:

  - added the patch on statx() support
  - improved the patch on IPV6_<ADD|DROP>_MEMBERSHIP to take into
    account the possibility of different names for a field
  - minor corrections in commit messages

v3->v4:

  - improved commit messages (fixed some typos, improved relevance)

v2->v3:

  - updated and improved commit messages
  - added IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP support to the patch on setsockopt()'s
    option

v1->v2:

  - added the patch on setsockopt()'s option IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
  - improved the commit messages
