There would only be an information leak if the information was made
available to users/apps which are running at a lower privilege level
than QEMU. If you are root, or running as the QEMU user/group, then
all the information is already available by ptrace'ing QEMU or other
means. The tracing framework merely makes it available in an easier
to access way.

I don't actually think the getenv thing is a security issue in any case.
If there was a security problem exploitable via getenv, then the bug woul=
d
lie in the application invoking QEMU for not ensuring the ENV contents
were safe before exec'ing QEMU. Libvirt is paranoid by default and scrubs
QEMU's env only keeping a specific sanitized whitelist for exactly these
reasons.
