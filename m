-/*
- * A guide to using safe_syscall() to handle interactions between guest
- * syscalls and guest signals:
- *
- * Guest syscalls come in two flavours:
- *
- * (1) Non-interruptible syscalls
- *
- * These are guest syscalls that never get interrupted by signals and
- * so never return EINTR. They can be implemented straightforwardly in
- * QEMU: just make sure that if the implementation code has to make any
- * blocking calls that those calls are retried if they return EINTR.
- * It's also OK to implement these with safe_syscall, though it will be
- * a little less efficient if a signal is delivered at the 'wrong' moment.
- *
- * Some non-interruptible syscalls need to be handled using block_signals()
- * to block signals for the duration of the syscall. This mainly applies
- * to code which needs to modify the data structures used by the
- * host_signal_handler() function and the functions it calls, including
- * all syscalls which change the thread's signal mask.
- *
- * (2) Interruptible syscalls
- *
- * These are guest syscalls that can be interrupted by signals and
- * for which we need to either return EINTR or arrange for the guest
- * syscall to be restarted. This category includes both syscalls which
- * always restart (and in the kernel return -ERESTARTNOINTR), ones
- * which only restart if there is no handler (kernel returns -ERESTARTNOHAND
- * or -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK), and the most common kind which restart
- * if the handler was registered with SA_RESTART (kernel returns
- * -ERESTARTSYS). System calls which are only interruptible in some
- * situations (like 'open') also need to be handled this way.
- *
- * Here it is important that the host syscall is made
- * via this safe_syscall() function, and *not* via the host libc.
- * If the host libc is used then the implementation will appear to work
- * most of the time, but there will be a race condition where a
- * signal could arrive just before we make the host syscall inside libc,
- * and then then guest syscall will not correctly be interrupted.
- * Instead the implementation of the guest syscall can use the safe_syscall
- * function but otherwise just return the result or errno in the usual
- * way; the main loop code will take care of restarting the syscall
- * if appropriate.
- *
- * (If the implementation needs to make multiple host syscalls this is
- * OK; any which might really block must be via safe_syscall(); for those
- * which are only technically blocking (ie which we know in practice won't
- * stay in the host kernel indefinitely) it's OK to use libc if necessary.
- * You must be able to cope with backing out correctly if some safe_syscall
- * you make in the implementation returns either -TARGET_ERESTARTSYS or
- * EINTR though.)
- *
- * block_signals() cannot be used for interruptible syscalls.
- *
- *
- * How and why the safe_syscall implementation works:
- *
- * The basic setup is that we make the host syscall via a known
- * section of host native assembly. If a signal occurs, our signal
- * handler checks the interrupted host PC against the addresse of that
- * known section. If the PC is before or at the address of the syscall
- * instruction then we change the PC to point at a "return
- * -TARGET_ERESTARTSYS" code path instead, and then exit the signal handler
- * (causing the safe_syscall() call to immediately return that value).
- * Then in the main.c loop if we see this magic return value we adjust
- * the guest PC to wind it back to before the system call, and invoke
- * the guest signal handler as usual.
- *
- * This winding-back will happen in two cases:
- * (1) signal came in just before we took the host syscall (a race);
- *   in this case we'll take the guest signal and have another go
- *   at the syscall afterwards, and this is indistinguishable for the
- *   guest from the timing having been different such that the guest
- *   signal really did win the race
- * (2) signal came in while the host syscall was blocking, and the
- *   host kernel decided the syscall should be restarted;
- *   in this case we want to restart the guest syscall also, and so
- *   rewinding is the right thing. (Note that "restart" semantics mean
- *   "first call the signal handler, then reattempt the syscall".)
- * The other situation to consider is when a signal came in while the
- * host syscall was blocking, and the host kernel decided that the syscall
- * should not be restarted; in this case QEMU's host signal handler will
- * be invoked with the PC pointing just after the syscall instruction,
- * with registers indicating an EINTR return; the special code in the
- * handler will not kick in, and we will return EINTR to the guest as
- * we should.
- *
- * Notice that we can leave the host kernel to make the decision for
- * us about whether to do a restart of the syscall or not; we do not
- * need to check SA_RESTART flags in QEMU or distinguish the various
- * kinds of restartability.
