Hmm, this looked strange at first, but I see now where the difference
is.

In the old state, crypto used qemu_opts_to_qdict() and then fed all
options to its own visitor. I'm not sure whether I can clearly call this
a bug, but it's different from other format drivers, which parse all
options they know and pass the rest to the protocol driver.

The new version was converted to use qemu_opts_to_qdict_filtered() like
in all other drivers, so we got the same behaviour in crypto: Unknown
options are passed to the protocol.

As it happens, file-posix does support 'preallocation', so the operation
will return success now. Of course, passing the preallocation to the
protocol level is questionable for non-raw image formats, and completely
useless when you create the protocol level with size 0 and you'll call
blk_truncate() later.

I think we would get back to the old state if you just changed the
qemu_opts_to_qdict_filtered() call back to qemu_opts_to_qdict(). But it
make the driver inconsistent with other drivers again.

Maybe the best way to solve this would be to just implement
preallocation. It should be as easy as adding a 'preallocation' create
option (in QAPI and block_crypto_create_opts_luks), putting the
PreallocMode into BlockCryptoCreateData and then passing it to the
blk_truncate() call in block_crypto_init_func().
