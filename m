Running the tests on macOS is also quite simple if you have a github
account. You simply add the "Cirrus-CI" from the marketplace to your
forked qemu repository there, and then push your work to a branch in
that repo. Cirrus-CI then automatically tests your stuff on macOS (and
also FreeBSD), e.g.:

 https://cirrus-ci.com/build/4961684689256448
