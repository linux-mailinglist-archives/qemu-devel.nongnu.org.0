Hi Paolo,

now that things exposed by my patch are fixed, back on this topic :-)

The problem I see here is, as usual, one of meaning.

Are qemu_get_clock_ns, cpu_get_ticks and qemu_start_warp_timer
accelerator-specific cpu interfaces?

Looking at their implementation, currently I don't think they are, what do you think?

Should these be grouped together with

create_vcpu_thread,
kick_vcpu_thread,
synchronize_cpu_state

in the same interface?

There is some more use of use_icount also in non-TCG code, to either ignore icount VIRTUAL timers or produce more deterministic behavior:

dma-helpers.c checks it to make reads "more deterministic" then icount is enabled,
util/async.c indirectly checks it calling timerlistgroup_deadline_ns to do aio_compute_timeout,
as does main_loop_wait(), to check that each timer can be used for deadlines (is not an icount VIRTUAL timer).
hw/core/ptimer.c checks it to again offer more deterministic behavior for icount,
and there is some use of it in target/riscv/csr.c (curious, as I would expect to rely on cpu_get_host_ticks instead of using icount directly).
and the notify_cb() in timerlist_notify() also checks it.

May be more..?

[should read "qemu_start_warp_timer() does have an "if (icount_enabled())"']

It looks absolutely fishy to me.

One way it could be better I think would be to have this "if" in the places where qemu_start_warp_timer is actually called, and make it clear that this an icount-specific thing,

ie saying in

main_loop_wait()
{

if (icount_enabled()) {
  icount_start_warp_timer()
}

}

and also in timerlist_rearm saying:

if (icount_enabled()) {
  icount_start_warp_timer()
}


Regarding the actual warp, icount_warp_rt(),
note that qtest has its own "qtest_clock_warp" function,

which in my mind is just _misusing_ the icount bias field to realize its functionality:

atomic_set_i64(&timers_state.qemu_icount_bias,
               timers_state.qemu_icount_bias + warp);

instead of having its own counter.

Speculation: does separating the two even allow qtesting icount and replay functionality?

If we create a separate counter for qtest, as we do in the patch, I think is correct to treat them separately,

and check for qtest_enabled() and icount_enabled() separately as necessary in each given situation,
as we actually have now already, but with the opportune adjustments to correct for the now non-shared counter.

Which means that we need to make more explicit the cases where the qtest_enabled() and icount_enabled() cases are actually matching,
which I think would benefit from being explicit.

In my understanding the cases where qtest_enabled() and icount_enabled() actually match are the ones where we want to behave more "deterministically",
either because we are testing (qtest_enabled()) or because we want a stable instruction count (icount_enabled()).

Maybe you could mention in more detail what you propose here?

To me it really seems correct to separate icount and qtest, the fact that their implementation currently ends up using the same counter is what needs to be rectified first,
but if you see a better abstraction to be able to refactor them better let me know, maybe it could be a next step?

I am not sure that the cpu accelerator interface is the right place to do this abstraction semantically, but maybe you can show me otherwise?

Happy to see the loadvm bug now finally fixed, it has been bothering me for a while :-)
