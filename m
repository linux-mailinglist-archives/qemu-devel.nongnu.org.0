Currently it is good to  connect CLIC to virt machine.  I can fix it in 
the next version if it is OK for you.

SMARTL is a fpga evaluation board.  We usually use it  to debug programs 
for XuanTie CPU serials.
It has a 32bit CPU, 1 UART,  4 timers, and the CLIC interrupt 
controller. I will give  a detailed documentation
when I upstream it.

There are still many other  RISC-V boards, but more complex. I plan to 
upstream the XuanTie CPU
and  some widely used boards after the P extension and CLIC.
