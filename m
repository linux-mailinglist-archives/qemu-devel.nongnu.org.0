I guess you tested a single Windows version, correct?
It may be that requirements differ between Windows versions, just as you
say below about the required enlightenments.

The code is already in the upstream QEMU tree, it's a known-working code,
so I think it is better to simply work incrementally on further improving
the current version rather than backing it out and merging it again later.

This way it will (hopefully) get some wider testing sooner.

Not to mention that it is less likely for some other QEMU change to
accidentally break it.
