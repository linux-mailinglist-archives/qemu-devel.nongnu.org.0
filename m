Title:
  qemu.org/docs/ contains some old docs

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  When I searched for QEMU docs in a search engine I ended up on this
  page:

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/qemu-doc.html

  That is 4.2.50 documentation. It took me some time to realize that
  there is actually 5.1.50 documentation under
  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/ and that the 4.2 documentation is
  out of date.

  Presumably this file is cruft that was left over from a previous build
  of the website and something like a `make clean` is required?
