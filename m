it's not currently, but if it would it would not work with your patch properly
or break unexpectedly since whoever would change hotplug_handler_pre_plug()
might not notice that machine code need to be taken care of.

Try to consider devices and machine as separate libraries. Which should
in reasonable limits be independent and work through documented interfaces.
In that case likehood of breaking something would be less than relying on
current code impl./call order with implicit inter-dependencies.
