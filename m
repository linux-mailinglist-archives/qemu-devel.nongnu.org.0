It's tricky; for distro-based users, hitting 'update' and getting both
makes a lot of sense; but as you say you ened to let them do stuff
individually if they want to, so they can track down problems.
There's also a newer problem which is people want to run the QEMU in
containers on hosts that have separate update schedules - the kernel
version relationship is then much more fluid.

So that's as we already do.

The format of the migration stream means that you can't skip an unknown
subsection; it's not possible to resume parsing the stream without
knowing what was supposed to be there. [This is pretty awful
but my last attempts to rework it hit a dead end]

So we still need to tie subsections to machine types; that way
you don't send them to old qemu's and there for you don't have the
problem of the qemu receiving something it doesn't know.

Still, you could skip things where the destination kernel doesn't know
about it.

There's no logical difference between 'flags' and 'names of subsections'
- they're got the same problem in someone somewhere knowing which are
  safe.

>=20

Sorry, can't do (3) - we need to keep the binding for subsections to
machine types for qemu compatibility;  I'm open for something for
kernel compat, but not when it's breaking the qemu subsection
checks.
