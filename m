Only gio in glib actually uses gobject. You would have to look at
other GNOME C projects to realize this is the most common pattern.

It's not a strict rule.

We won't do a bulk update (that was never my intention, that would be
ridiculous).

Adding "self" to the zoo of variable names to refer to the
implentation instance isn't going to make a revolution, but is a good
pattern. I didn't think we would need to argue about it or modify
CODING_STYLE. But I should have known better ;)

This code is probably not a OOP-style "method" (a method associated to
an instnace). I can't imagine what would be "self" here.

Is "s" or "ss" or "ioc", "fioc" more readable?

self is of the type being implemented. Usually it is inside a
my_foo_method() in my-foo.c, so you know that self is of MyFoo type
without effort.
