Ok, if I'm reading the code correctly, it seems we do take care to
re-use a single connection to PA for all audiodevs we create. So a
VMname is fine for the connection.

Yep, I wasn't really concerned about internals - from the user POV being
able to accurately distinguish streams in pavucontrol is very important
though, so we should ensure that's possible. If we use 'id'  for the
stream as a default though, we should still allow an override, as 'id'
values are not really intended as end user visible data. If a guest
has multiple devices I'd expect to be able to give them names that are
meaningful to me as a user, not something libvirt auto-generates for
its own machine oriented use.
