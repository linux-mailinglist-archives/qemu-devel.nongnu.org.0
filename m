Not currently. The trick is to have something flexible enough without
exposing internals. I guess we could consider the gdb register
enumeration or maybe hook into stuff declared as
tcg_global_mem_new_i[64|32]. That won't get every "register" but it
should certainly cover the main general purpose ones. Things like SVE
and AdvSIMD vector registers wouldn't be seen though.

Again tricky as not every register read/write is obvious from TCG -
vector registers tweaked from helpers would be a good example.

The example plugins are really just toys for experimenting with the API
- I don't see too much problem with them being in tests. However the
howvec plugin is very guest architecture specific so we could consider a
bit more of a hierarchy. Maybe these should all live in tests/tcg?

icount is going to be the best you can get for deterministic time -
other efforts to pause/restart virtual time going in and out of plugins
are just going to add a lot of overhead.

Remember QEMU doesn't even try to be a cycle accurate emulation so
expecting to get reasonable timing information out of these plugins is a
stretch. Maybe I should make that clearer in the design document?

The gdb behaviour is just a massive hack. When single-stepping in GDB we
prevent timer IRQs from being delivered - they have still fired and are
pending and will execute as soon as you hit continue.

This would complicate things - the current iteration I'm working on
drops the haddr cb in favour of dynamically resolving the vaddr in the
callback. But that approach is only valid during the callback before
something else potentially pollutes the TLB.

Well we have that now. At each TB generation event the callback is free to =
register
as many or few callbacks as it likes dynamically.

This can be done internally - a plugin can unregister itself once it has
collected everything it wanted. If it wants to hang around you can
qemu_plugin_reset to reset all callbacks.

Do you want something finer grained?

This would be tricky for -smp > 1 because other threads will have run on
while you are making your decision. It would certainly be useful for
analyzing failed states though.
