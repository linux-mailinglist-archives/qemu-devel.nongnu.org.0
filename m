I am all intrigued by these vector instructions. Apple was really big on
using them back in the day so programs like Quicktime and iTunes definitely
use them. I'm not sure if the PowerPC's altivec vector instructions map to
host vector instructions already, but if they don't, mapping them would
give us a huge speedup in certain places. Would anyone know if this was
already done in QEMU?
