Thanks for clarification.

Could  you provide your views if it would be possible to support also
paravirtualized v4l-subdev devices which is enabled by media
controller to expose ISP processing blocks to linux userspace.
Ofcourse, we might need to change implementation and spec to support that
Please refer (1) for details.

Like pointed out above, Gstreamer is not the only framework present there.
We have the newer libcamera framework [2] and then Openmax (used in
Android Hal )
Refer [3] for comparison.

My intentions are to make the implementation more generic so that it
can be used by different frameworks on different platforms.
