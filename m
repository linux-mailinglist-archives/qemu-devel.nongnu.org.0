I didn't miss your last update, on 10 April. The reason I didn't respond
then was that, the table that you create here, needs to be approved by
Linux developers. In other words, the table should summarize how Linux
expects DT/ACPI to look, for the given use cases. It's not something
that I can comment on. The requirements come from Linux, and we should
attempt (in QEMU and the fw) to satisfy them.

If those use cases / requirements haven't been *designed* in Linux, in
the first place, then the discussion belongs even more on a kernel
development list. (I really can't say what Linux *should* expect, and
even if I had input on that, discussing it *just* on qemu-devel would be
futile.)

I mean, considering ACPI and the UEFI memmap at least, can we take
examples from the physical world (I guess x86 too)? What does Linux (and
maybe Windows) expect wrt. hotpluggable memory areas, in ACPI and in the
UEFI memmap?

I find it hard to believe that these are such use cases that we have to
*invent* now. It seems more likely that OSes already handle these use
cases, they have expectations, and we should *collect* them.

Thanks
Laszlo
