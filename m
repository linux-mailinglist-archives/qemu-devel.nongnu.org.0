Well some guests are known to make crazy assumptions. E.g. they would
see this bit and say "oh so I know this hyperv" or something to
that end.

Any data on which changes exactly?
All I know about is this list, though it's pretty old.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-x=
p/bb457054(v=3Dtechnet.10)?redirectedfrom=3DMSDN

Any chance it was actually to do with the EOM table that bypasses
activation?

Tying things to the machine type is not what I had in mind.
A separate flag would also be helpful so users can tweak this
for new machine types, too.

> Guest-visible changes shouldn't be exposed to old machine-types.

Well almost any change in qemu is guest visible to some level.
Even optimizations are guest visible.
We made changes in ACPI without versioning in the past but I'm not
opposed to versioning here. However in that case pls do add a bit
of documentation about why this is done here.
What I am asking about is whether we need a flag to disable
this as part of the stable interface.
