The libvhost-user problem is that the library is mostly designed for a
single-threaded event loop that handles all virtqueue and vhost-user
protocol activity.

As soon as virtqueues are handled by dedicated threads there are race
conditions between the virtqueue threads and the vhost-user protocol
thread.

A virtqueue thread may or may not have an up-to-date view of memory
translation.  This can result in it missing memory that is currently
being hotplugged and continuing to access memory that has been removed.

Dave might have additional comments.
