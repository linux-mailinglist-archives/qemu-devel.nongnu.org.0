Well kdcom is sending out UART through the virtual serial port, this
results in very slow speeds (try it out if you get a chance), because
of that most Windows kernel developers use  VMWare with a combination
of a tool called VirtualKD which implements it's own debug transport on
the Windows part and patches the hypervisor (aka VMWare) to get the 
VMExits.
This way it can transfer more and bigger blocks faster, to the debugger.

With the synthetic debugger interface in-place (which you can use since 
Windows 7) all these tricks are not really required, you just need to 
implement it :P .

Thanks,
