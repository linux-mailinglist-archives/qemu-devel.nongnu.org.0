Hi Havard,
I fuzzed the npcm750-evb machine until I hit over 85% coverage over all
the new npcm.*\.c files. The only thing I found specific to the new
code, so far:

cat << EOF | ./qemu-system-arm -machine npcm750-evb -m 128M -qtest stdio 
write 0xf0009040 0x4 0xc4c4c4c4
write 0xf0009040 0x4 0x4
EOF

ERROR:../hw/timer/npcm7xx_timer.c:160:npcm7xx_timer_pause: assertion failed: (t->remaining_ns > 0)
Bail out! ERROR:../hw/timer/npcm7xx_timer.c:160:npcm7xx_timer_pause: assertion failed: (t->remaining_ns > 0)
Aborted

I'm doing the same for the quanta-gsj machine, but I'm not sure whether
it will cover more code, so I'm happy to leave a:

Tested-by: Alexander Bulekov <alxndr@bu.edu>

for the patches that add new virtual-device code (1-5, 7-12 ?)
