If an actual definition is out of reach, we should still say
*something*.  Even a mere "it's complicated" would help, because it
warns the reader he's on thin ice.

Can we give examples for "unsafe"?  You mentioned nested event loops.

For what it's worth, here's how POSIX.1-2017 defined "thread-safe":

    A thread-safe function can be safely invoked concurrently with other
    calls to the same function, or with calls to any other thread-safe
    functions, by multiple threads.  Each function defined in the System
    Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2017 is thread-safe unless explicitly
    stated otherwise.  Examples are any "pure" function, a function
    which holds a mutex locked while it is accessing static storage, or
    objects shared among threads.

Let's spell this out.  After your paragraph

    Member 'coroutine' tells the QMP dispatcher whether the command handler
    is safe to be run in a coroutine.  It defaults to false.  If it is true=
,
    the command handler is called from coroutine context and may yield whil=
e
    waiting for an external event (such as I/O completion) in order to avoi=
d
    blocking the guest and other background operations.

add something like

    Since the command handler may assume coroutine-context, any callers
    other than the QMP dispatcher must also call it in coroutine
    context.  In particular, HMP commands calling such a QMP command
    handler must be marked .coroutine =3D true in hmp-commands.hx.

Patch ordering issue: this becomes possible only in PATCH 10.
Possible solutions:

* Add the last sentence only in PATCH 10.

* Write "HMP commands cannot call such a QMP command handler" in PATCH
  8, replace it in PATCH 10.

* Add a "TODO make that possible" line here, drop it in PATCH 10.

* Reorder patches.

I don't like the first one much.  Anyway, up to you.
