      s/(?=::\n\n +\|qemu)/.. parsed-literal/g;
      s/:\n\n::$/::/gm;
      print' > $rst

In addition, the following changes were made manually:

- target-i386.rst and target-mips.rst: replace CPU model documentation with
  an include directive

- monitor.rst: replace the command section with a comment

- images.rst: add toctree

- invocation.rst and ivshmem.rst: annotate more parsed-literal blocks

Content that is not @included remains exclusive to qemu-doc.texi.

+.. _Supported-build-platforms:
+
+Supported build platforms
+=========================
+
+QEMU aims to support building and executing on multiple host OS
+platforms. This appendix outlines which platforms are the major build
+targets. These platforms are used as the basis for deciding upon the
+minimum required versions of 3rd party software QEMU depends on. The
+supported platforms are the targets for automated testing performed by
+the project when patches are submitted for review, and tested before and
+after merge.
+
+If a platform is not listed here, it does not imply that QEMU won't
+work. If an unlisted platform has comparable software versions to a
+listed platform, there is every expectation that it will work. Bug
+reports are welcome for problems encountered on unlisted platforms
+unless they are clearly older vintage than what is described here.
+
+Note that when considering software versions shipped in distros as
+support targets, QEMU considers only the version number, and assumes the
+features in that distro match the upstream release with the same
+version. In other words, if a distro backports extra features to the
+software in their distro, QEMU upstream code will not add explicit
+support for those backports, unless the feature is auto-detectable in a
+manner that works for the upstream releases too.
+
+The Repology site https://repology.org is a useful resource to identify
+currently shipped versions of software in various operating systems,
+though it does not cover all distros listed below.
+
+Linux OS
+--------
+
+For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases, the project
+will aim to support all versions that are not end of life by their
+respective vendors. For the purposes of identifying supported software
+versions, the project will look at Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE distros.
+Other short- lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar software
+versions.
+
+For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim to
+support the most recent major version at all times. Support for the
+previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new major
+version is released, or when it reaches "end of life". For the purposes
+of identifying supported software versions, the project will look at
+RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu LTS, and SLES distros. Other long-lifetime distros
+will be assumed to ship similar software versions.
+
+Windows
+-------
+
+The project supports building with current versions of the MinGW
+toolchain, hosted on Linux.
+
+macOS
+-----
+
+The project supports building with the two most recent versions of
+macOS, with the current homebrew package set available.
+
+FreeBSD
+-------
+
+The project aims to support the all the versions which are not end of
+life.
+
+NetBSD
+------
+
+The project aims to support the most recent major version at all times.
+Support for the previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the
+new major version is released.
+
+OpenBSD
+-------
+
+The project aims to support the all the versions which are not end of
+life.

+.. _gdb_005fusage:
+
+GDB usage
+---------
+
+QEMU has a primitive support to work with gdb, so that you can do
+'Ctrl-C' while the virtual machine is running and inspect its state.
+
+In order to use gdb, launch QEMU with the '-s' option. It will wait for
+a gdb connection:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| -s -kernel bzImage -hda rootdisk.img -append "root=/dev/hda"
+   Connected to host network interface: tun0
+   Waiting gdb connection on port 1234
+
+Then launch gdb on the 'vmlinux' executable::
+
+   > gdb vmlinux
+
+In gdb, connect to QEMU::
+
+   (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
+
+Then you can use gdb normally. For example, type 'c' to launch the
+kernel::
+
+   (gdb) c
+
+Here are some useful tips in order to use gdb on system code:
+
+1. Use ``info reg`` to display all the CPU registers.
+
+2. Use ``x/10i $eip`` to display the code at the PC position.
+
+3. Use ``set architecture i8086`` to dump 16 bit code. Then use
+   ``x/10i $cs*16+$eip`` to dump the code at the PC position.
+
+Advanced debugging options:
+
+The default single stepping behavior is step with the IRQs and timer
+service routines off. It is set this way because when gdb executes a
+single step it expects to advance beyond the current instruction. With
+the IRQs and timer service routines on, a single step might jump into
+the one of the interrupt or exception vectors instead of executing the
+current instruction. This means you may hit the same breakpoint a number
+of times before executing the instruction gdb wants to have executed.
+Because there are rare circumstances where you want to single step into
+an interrupt vector the behavior can be controlled from GDB. There are
+three commands you can query and set the single step behavior:
+
+``maintenance packet qqemu.sstepbits``
+   This will display the MASK bits used to control the single stepping
+   IE:
+
+   ::
+
+      (gdb) maintenance packet qqemu.sstepbits
+      sending: "qqemu.sstepbits"
+      received: "ENABLE=1,NOIRQ=2,NOTIMER=4"
+
+``maintenance packet qqemu.sstep``
+   This will display the current value of the mask used when single
+   stepping IE:
+
+   ::
+
+      (gdb) maintenance packet qqemu.sstep
+      sending: "qqemu.sstep"
+      received: "0x7"
+
+``maintenance packet Qqemu.sstep=HEX_VALUE``
+   This will change the single step mask, so if wanted to enable IRQs on
+   the single step, but not timers, you would use:
+
+   ::
+
+      (gdb) maintenance packet Qqemu.sstep=0x5
+      sending: "qemu.sstep=0x5"
+      received: "OK"

+
+Disk Images
+-----------
+
+QEMU supports many disk image formats, including growable disk images
+(their size increase as non empty sectors are written), compressed and
+encrypted disk images.
+
+.. _disk_005fimages_005fquickstart:
+
+Quick start for disk image creation
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+You can create a disk image with the command::
+
+   qemu-img create myimage.img mysize
+
+where myimage.img is the disk image filename and mysize is its size in
+kilobytes. You can add an ``M`` suffix to give the size in megabytes and
+a ``G`` suffix for gigabytes.
+
+See the qemu-img invocation documentation for more information.
+
+.. _disk_005fimages_005fsnapshot_005fmode:
+
+Snapshot mode
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If you use the option ``-snapshot``, all disk images are considered as
+read only. When sectors in written, they are written in a temporary file
+created in ``/tmp``. You can however force the write back to the raw
+disk images by using the ``commit`` monitor command (or C-a s in the
+serial console).
+
+.. _vm_005fsnapshots:
+
+VM snapshots
+~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+VM snapshots are snapshots of the complete virtual machine including CPU
+state, RAM, device state and the content of all the writable disks. In
+order to use VM snapshots, you must have at least one non removable and
+writable block device using the ``qcow2`` disk image format. Normally
+this device is the first virtual hard drive.
+
+Use the monitor command ``savevm`` to create a new VM snapshot or
+replace an existing one. A human readable name can be assigned to each
+snapshot in addition to its numerical ID.
+
+Use ``loadvm`` to restore a VM snapshot and ``delvm`` to remove a VM
+snapshot. ``info snapshots`` lists the available snapshots with their
+associated information::
+
+   (qemu) info snapshots
+   Snapshot devices: hda
+   Snapshot list (from hda):
+   ID        TAG                 VM SIZE                DATE       VM CLOCK
+   1         start                   41M 2006-08-06 12:38:02   00:00:14.954
+   2                                 40M 2006-08-06 12:43:29   00:00:18.633
+   3         msys                    40M 2006-08-06 12:44:04   00:00:23.514
+
+A VM snapshot is made of a VM state info (its size is shown in
+``info snapshots``) and a snapshot of every writable disk image. The VM
+state info is stored in the first ``qcow2`` non removable and writable
+block device. The disk image snapshots are stored in every disk image.
+The size of a snapshot in a disk image is difficult to evaluate and is
+not shown by ``info snapshots`` because the associated disk sectors are
+shared among all the snapshots to save disk space (otherwise each
+snapshot would need a full copy of all the disk images).
+
+When using the (unrelated) ``-snapshot`` option
+(`disk_images_snapshot_mode <#disk_005fimages_005fsnapshot_005fmode>`__),
+you can always make VM snapshots, but they are deleted as soon as you
+exit QEMU.
+
+VM snapshots currently have the following known limitations:
+
+-  They cannot cope with removable devices if they are removed or
+   inserted after a snapshot is done.
+
+-  A few device drivers still have incomplete snapshot support so their
+   state is not saved or restored properly (in particular USB).

+Invocation
+----------
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [options] [disk_image]
+
+disk_image is a raw hard disk image for IDE hard disk 0. Some targets do
+not need a disk image.
+
+Device URL Syntax
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In addition to using normal file images for the emulated storage
+devices, QEMU can also use networked resources such as iSCSI devices.
+These are specified using a special URL syntax.
+
+``iSCSI``
+   iSCSI support allows QEMU to access iSCSI resources directly and use
+   as images for the guest storage. Both disk and cdrom images are
+   supported.
+
+   Syntax for specifying iSCSI LUNs is
+   "iscsi://<target-ip>[:<port>]/<target-iqn>/<lun>"
+
+   By default qemu will use the iSCSI initiator-name
+   'iqn.2008-11.org.linux-kvm[:<name>]' but this can also be set from
+   the command line or a configuration file.
+
+   Since version Qemu 2.4 it is possible to specify a iSCSI request
+   timeout to detect stalled requests and force a reestablishment of the
+   session. The timeout is specified in seconds. The default is 0 which
+   means no timeout. Libiscsi 1.15.0 or greater is required for this
+   feature.
+
+   Example (without authentication):
+
+   .. parsed-literal::
+

+
+``HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS``
+   QEMU supports read-only access to files accessed over http(s) and
+   ftp(s).
+
+   Syntax using a single filename:
+
+   ::
+
+      <protocol>://[<username>[:<password>]@]<host>/<path>
+
+   where:
+
+   ``protocol``
+      'http', 'https', 'ftp', or 'ftps'.
+
+   ``username``
+      Optional username for authentication to the remote server.
+
+   ``password``
+      Optional password for authentication to the remote server.
+
+   ``host``
+      Address of the remote server.
+
+   ``path``
+      Path on the remote server, including any query string.
+
+   The following options are also supported:
+
+   ``url``
+      The full URL when passing options to the driver explicitly.
+
+   ``readahead``
+      The amount of data to read ahead with each range request to the
+      remote server. This value may optionally have the suffix 'T', 'G',
+      'M', 'K', 'k' or 'b'. If it does not have a suffix, it will be
+      assumed to be in bytes. The value must be a multiple of 512 bytes.
+      It defaults to 256k.
+
+   ``sslverify``
+      Whether to verify the remote server's certificate when connecting
+      over SSL. It can have the value 'on' or 'off'. It defaults to
+      'on'.
+
+   ``cookie``
+      Send this cookie (it can also be a list of cookies separated by
+      ';') with each outgoing request. Only supported when using
+      protocols such as HTTP which support cookies, otherwise ignored.
+
+   ``timeout``
+      Set the timeout in seconds of the CURL connection. This timeout is
+      the time that CURL waits for a response from the remote server to
+      get the size of the image to be downloaded. If not set, the
+      default timeout of 5 seconds is used.
+
+   Note that when passing options to qemu explicitly, ``driver`` is the
+   value of <protocol>.
+
+   Example: boot from a remote Fedora 20 live ISO image

+
+Inter-VM Shared Memory device
+-----------------------------
+
+On Linux hosts, a shared memory device is available. The basic syntax
+is:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system_x86| -device ivshmem-plain,memdev=hostmem
+
+where hostmem names a host memory backend. For a POSIX shared memory
+backend, use something like
+
+::
+
+   -object memory-backend-file,size=1M,share,mem-path=/dev/shm/ivshmem,id=hostmem
+
+If desired, interrupts can be sent between guest VMs accessing the same
+shared memory region. Interrupt support requires using a shared memory
+server and using a chardev socket to connect to it. The code for the
+shared memory server is qemu.git/contrib/ivshmem-server. An example
+syntax when using the shared memory server is:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   # First start the ivshmem server once and for all
+   ivshmem-server -p pidfile -S path -m shm-name -l shm-size -n vectors
+
+   # Then start your qemu instances with matching arguments
+   |qemu_system_x86| -device ivshmem-doorbell,vectors=vectors,chardev=id
+                    -chardev socket,path=path,id=id
+
+When using the server, the guest will be assigned a VM ID (>=0) that
+allows guests using the same server to communicate via interrupts.
+Guests can read their VM ID from a device register (see
+ivshmem-spec.txt).
+
+Migration with ivshmem
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+With device property ``master=on``, the guest will copy the shared
+memory on migration to the destination host. With ``master=off``, the
+guest will not be able to migrate with the device attached. In the
+latter case, the device should be detached and then reattached after
+migration using the PCI hotplug support.
+
+At most one of the devices sharing the same memory can be master. The
+master must complete migration before you plug back the other devices.
+
+ivshmem and hugepages
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Instead of specifying the <shm size> using POSIX shm, you may specify a
+memory backend that has hugepage support:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system_x86| -object memory-backend-file,size=1G,mem-path=/dev/hugepages/my-shmem-file,share,id=mb1
+                    -device ivshmem-plain,memdev=mb1
+
+ivshmem-server also supports hugepages mount points with the ``-m``
+memory path argument.

+
+Network emulation
+-----------------
+
+QEMU can simulate several network cards (e.g. PCI or ISA cards on the PC
+target) and can connect them to a network backend on the host or an
+emulated hub. The various host network backends can either be used to
+connect the NIC of the guest to a real network (e.g. by using a TAP
+devices or the non-privileged user mode network stack), or to other
+guest instances running in another QEMU process (e.g. by using the
+socket host network backend).
+
+Using TAP network interfaces
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This is the standard way to connect QEMU to a real network. QEMU adds a
+virtual network device on your host (called ``tapN``), and you can then
+configure it as if it was a real ethernet card.
+
+Linux host
+^^^^^^^^^^
+
+As an example, you can download the ``linux-test-xxx.tar.gz`` archive
+and copy the script ``qemu-ifup`` in ``/etc`` and configure properly
+``sudo`` so that the command ``ifconfig`` contained in ``qemu-ifup`` can
+be executed as root. You must verify that your host kernel supports the
+TAP network interfaces: the device ``/dev/net/tun`` must be present.
+
+See `sec_invocation <#sec_005finvocation>`__ to have examples of command
+lines using the TAP network interfaces.
+
+Windows host
+^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+There is a virtual ethernet driver for Windows 2000/XP systems, called
+TAP-Win32. But it is not included in standard QEMU for Windows, so you
+will need to get it separately. It is part of OpenVPN package, so
+download OpenVPN from : https://openvpn.net/.
+
+Using the user mode network stack
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+By using the option ``-net user`` (default configuration if no ``-net``
+option is specified), QEMU uses a completely user mode network stack
+(you don't need root privilege to use the virtual network). The virtual
+network configuration is the following::
+
+        guest (10.0.2.15)  <------>  Firewall/DHCP server <-----> Internet
+                              |          (10.0.2.2)
+                              |
+                              ---->  DNS server (10.0.2.3)
+                              |
+                              ---->  SMB server (10.0.2.4)
+
+The QEMU VM behaves as if it was behind a firewall which blocks all
+incoming connections. You can use a DHCP client to automatically
+configure the network in the QEMU VM. The DHCP server assign addresses
+to the hosts starting from 10.0.2.15.
+
+In order to check that the user mode network is working, you can ping
+the address 10.0.2.2 and verify that you got an address in the range
+10.0.2.x from the QEMU virtual DHCP server.
+
+Note that ICMP traffic in general does not work with user mode
+networking. ``ping``, aka. ICMP echo, to the local router (10.0.2.2)
+shall work, however. If you're using QEMU on Linux >= 3.0, it can use
+unprivileged ICMP ping sockets to allow ``ping`` to the Internet. The
+host admin has to set the ping_group_range in order to grant access to
+those sockets. To allow ping for GID 100 (usually users group)::
+
+   echo 100 100 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range
+
+When using the built-in TFTP server, the router is also the TFTP server.
+
+When using the ``'-netdev user,hostfwd=...'`` option, TCP or UDP
+connections can be redirected from the host to the guest. It allows for
+example to redirect X11, telnet or SSH connections.
+
+Hubs
+~~~~
+
+QEMU can simulate several hubs. A hub can be thought of as a virtual
+connection between several network devices. These devices can be for
+example QEMU virtual ethernet cards or virtual Host ethernet devices
+(TAP devices). You can connect guest NICs or host network backends to
+such a hub using the ``-netdev
+hubport`` or ``-nic hubport`` options. The legacy ``-net`` option also
+connects the given device to the emulated hub with ID 0 (i.e. the
+default hub) unless you specify a netdev with ``-net nic,netdev=xxx``
+here.
+
+Connecting emulated networks between QEMU instances
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Using the ``-netdev socket`` (or ``-nic socket`` or ``-net socket``)
+option, it is possible to create emulated networks that span several
+QEMU instances. See the description of the ``-netdev socket`` option in
+the `Invocation chapter <#sec_005finvocation>`__ to have a basic
+example.

+
+TLS setup for network services
+------------------------------
+
+Almost all network services in QEMU have the ability to use TLS for
+session data encryption, along with x509 certificates for simple client
+authentication. What follows is a description of how to generate
+certificates suitable for usage with QEMU, and applies to the VNC
+server, character devices with the TCP backend, NBD server and client,
+and migration server and client.
+
+At a high level, QEMU requires certificates and private keys to be
+provided in PEM format. Aside from the core fields, the certificates
+should include various extension data sets, including v3 basic
+constraints data, key purpose, key usage and subject alt name.
+
+The GnuTLS package includes a command called ``certtool`` which can be
+used to easily generate certificates and keys in the required format
+with expected data present. Alternatively a certificate management
+service may be used.
+
+At a minimum it is necessary to setup a certificate authority, and issue
+certificates to each server. If using x509 certificates for
+authentication, then each client will also need to be issued a
+certificate.
+
+Assuming that the QEMU network services will only ever be exposed to
+clients on a private intranet, there is no need to use a commercial
+certificate authority to create certificates. A self-signed CA is
+sufficient, and in fact likely to be more secure since it removes the
+ability of malicious 3rd parties to trick the CA into mis-issuing certs
+for impersonating your services. The only likely exception where a
+commercial CA might be desirable is if enabling the VNC websockets
+server and exposing it directly to remote browser clients. In such a
+case it might be useful to use a commercial CA to avoid needing to
+install custom CA certs in the web browsers.
+
+The recommendation is for the server to keep its certificates in either
+``/etc/pki/qemu`` or for unprivileged users in ``$HOME/.pki/qemu``.
+
+.. _tls_005fgenerate_005fca:
+
+Setup the Certificate Authority
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This step only needs to be performed once per organization /
+organizational unit. First the CA needs a private key. This key must be
+kept VERY secret and secure. If this key is compromised the entire trust
+chain of the certificates issued with it is lost.
+
+::
+
+   # certtool --generate-privkey > ca-key.pem
+
+To generate a self-signed certificate requires one core piece of
+information, the name of the organization. A template file ``ca.info``
+should be populated with the desired data to avoid having to deal with
+interactive prompts from certtool::
+
+   # cat > ca.info <<EOF
+   cn = Name of your organization
+   ca
+   cert_signing_key
+   EOF
+   # certtool --generate-self-signed \
+              --load-privkey ca-key.pem
+              --template ca.info \
+              --outfile ca-cert.pem
+
+The ``ca`` keyword in the template sets the v3 basic constraints
+extension to indicate this certificate is for a CA, while
+``cert_signing_key`` sets the key usage extension to indicate this will
+be used for signing other keys. The generated ``ca-cert.pem`` file
+should be copied to all servers and clients wishing to utilize TLS
+support in the VNC server. The ``ca-key.pem`` must not be
+disclosed/copied anywhere except the host responsible for issuing
+certificates.
+
+.. _tls_005fgenerate_005fserver:
+
+Issuing server certificates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Each server (or host) needs to be issued with a key and certificate.
+When connecting the certificate is sent to the client which validates it
+against the CA certificate. The core pieces of information for a server
+certificate are the hostnames and/or IP addresses that will be used by
+clients when connecting. The hostname / IP address that the client
+specifies when connecting will be validated against the hostname(s) and
+IP address(es) recorded in the server certificate, and if no match is
+found the client will close the connection.
+
+Thus it is recommended that the server certificate include both the
+fully qualified and unqualified hostnames. If the server will have
+permanently assigned IP address(es), and clients are likely to use them
+when connecting, they may also be included in the certificate. Both IPv4
+and IPv6 addresses are supported. Historically certificates only
+included 1 hostname in the ``CN`` field, however, usage of this field
+for validation is now deprecated. Instead modern TLS clients will
+validate against the Subject Alt Name extension data, which allows for
+multiple entries. In the future usage of the ``CN`` field may be
+discontinued entirely, so providing SAN extension data is strongly
+recommended.
+
+On the host holding the CA, create template files containing the
+information for each server, and use it to issue server certificates.
+
+::
+
+   # cat > server-hostNNN.info <<EOF
+   organization = Name  of your organization
+   cn = hostNNN.foo.example.com
+   dns_name = hostNNN
+   dns_name = hostNNN.foo.example.com
+   ip_address = 10.0.1.87
+   ip_address = 192.8.0.92
+   ip_address = 2620:0:cafe::87
+   ip_address = 2001:24::92
+   tls_www_server
+   encryption_key
+   signing_key
+   EOF
+   # certtool --generate-privkey > server-hostNNN-key.pem
+   # certtool --generate-certificate \
+              --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
+              --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
+              --load-privkey server-hostNNN-key.pem \
+              --template server-hostNNN.info \
+              --outfile server-hostNNN-cert.pem
+
+The ``dns_name`` and ``ip_address`` fields in the template are setting
+the subject alt name extension data. The ``tls_www_server`` keyword is
+the key purpose extension to indicate this certificate is intended for
+usage in a web server. Although QEMU network services are not in fact
+HTTP servers (except for VNC websockets), setting this key purpose is
+still recommended. The ``encryption_key`` and ``signing_key`` keyword is
+the key usage extension to indicate this certificate is intended for
+usage in the data session.
+
+The ``server-hostNNN-key.pem`` and ``server-hostNNN-cert.pem`` files
+should now be securely copied to the server for which they were
+generated, and renamed to ``server-key.pem`` and ``server-cert.pem``
+when added to the ``/etc/pki/qemu`` directory on the target host. The
+``server-key.pem`` file is security sensitive and should be kept
+protected with file mode 0600 to prevent disclosure.
+
+.. _tls_005fgenerate_005fclient:
+
+Issuing client certificates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The QEMU x509 TLS credential setup defaults to enabling client
+verification using certificates, providing a simple authentication
+mechanism. If this default is used, each client also needs to be issued
+a certificate. The client certificate contains enough metadata to
+uniquely identify the client with the scope of the certificate
+authority. The client certificate would typically include fields for
+organization, state, city, building, etc.
+
+Once again on the host holding the CA, create template files containing
+the information for each client, and use it to issue client
+certificates.
+
+::
+
+   # cat > client-hostNNN.info <<EOF
+   country = GB
+   state = London
+   locality = City Of London
+   organization = Name of your organization
+   cn = hostNNN.foo.example.com
+   tls_www_client
+   encryption_key
+   signing_key
+   EOF
+   # certtool --generate-privkey > client-hostNNN-key.pem
+   # certtool --generate-certificate \
+              --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
+              --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
+              --load-privkey client-hostNNN-key.pem \
+              --template client-hostNNN.info \
+              --outfile client-hostNNN-cert.pem
+
+The subject alt name extension data is not required for clients, so the
+the ``dns_name`` and ``ip_address`` fields are not included. The
+``tls_www_client`` keyword is the key purpose extension to indicate this
+certificate is intended for usage in a web client. Although QEMU network
+clients are not in fact HTTP clients, setting this key purpose is still
+recommended. The ``encryption_key`` and ``signing_key`` keyword is the
+key usage extension to indicate this certificate is intended for usage
+in the data session.
+
+The ``client-hostNNN-key.pem`` and ``client-hostNNN-cert.pem`` files
+should now be securely copied to the client for which they were
+generated, and renamed to ``client-key.pem`` and ``client-cert.pem``
+when added to the ``/etc/pki/qemu`` directory on the target host. The
+``client-key.pem`` file is security sensitive and should be kept
+protected with file mode 0600 to prevent disclosure.
+
+If a single host is going to be using TLS in both a client and server
+role, it is possible to create a single certificate to cover both roles.
+This would be quite common for the migration and NBD services, where a
+QEMU process will be started by accepting a TLS protected incoming
+migration, and later itself be migrated out to another host. To generate
+a single certificate, simply include the template data from both the
+client and server instructions in one.
+
+::
+
+   # cat > both-hostNNN.info <<EOF
+   country = GB
+   state = London
+   locality = City Of London
+   organization = Name of your organization
+   cn = hostNNN.foo.example.com
+   dns_name = hostNNN
+   dns_name = hostNNN.foo.example.com
+   ip_address = 10.0.1.87
+   ip_address = 192.8.0.92
+   ip_address = 2620:0:cafe::87
+   ip_address = 2001:24::92
+   tls_www_server
+   tls_www_client
+   encryption_key
+   signing_key
+   EOF
+   # certtool --generate-privkey > both-hostNNN-key.pem
+   # certtool --generate-certificate \
+              --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
+              --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem \
+              --load-privkey both-hostNNN-key.pem \
+              --template both-hostNNN.info \
+              --outfile both-hostNNN-cert.pem
+
+When copying the PEM files to the target host, save them twice, once as
+``server-cert.pem`` and ``server-key.pem``, and again as
+``client-cert.pem`` and ``client-key.pem``.
+
+.. _tls_005fcreds_005fsetup:
+
+TLS x509 credential configuration
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+QEMU has a standard mechanism for loading x509 credentials that will be
+used for network services and clients. It requires specifying the
+``tls-creds-x509`` class name to the ``--object`` command line argument
+for the system emulators. Each set of credentials loaded should be given
+a unique string identifier via the ``id`` parameter. A single set of TLS
+credentials can be used for multiple network backends, so VNC,
+migration, NBD, character devices can all share the same credentials.
+Note, however, that credentials for use in a client endpoint must be
+loaded separately from those used in a server endpoint.
+
+When specifying the object, the ``dir`` parameters specifies which
+directory contains the credential files. This directory is expected to
+contain files with the names mentioned previously, ``ca-cert.pem``,
+``server-key.pem``, ``server-cert.pem``, ``client-key.pem`` and
+``client-cert.pem`` as appropriate. It is also possible to include a set
+of pre-generated Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters in a file
+``dh-params.pem``, which can be created using the
+``certtool --generate-dh-params`` command. If omitted, QEMU will
+dynamically generate DH parameters when loading the credentials.
+
+The ``endpoint`` parameter indicates whether the credentials will be
+used for a network client or server, and determines which PEM files are
+loaded.
+
+The ``verify`` parameter determines whether x509 certificate validation
+should be performed. This defaults to enabled, meaning clients will
+always validate the server hostname against the certificate subject alt
+name fields and/or CN field. It also means that servers will request
+that clients provide a certificate and validate them. Verification
+should never be turned off for client endpoints, however, it may be
+turned off for server endpoints if an alternative mechanism is used to
+authenticate clients. For example, the VNC server can use SASL to
+authenticate clients instead.
+
+To load server credentials with client certificate validation enabled
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| -object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,dir=/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=server
+
+while to load client credentials use
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| -object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,dir=/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=client
+
+Network services which support TLS will all have a ``tls-creds``
+parameter which expects the ID of the TLS credentials object. For
+example with VNC:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| -vnc 0.0.0.0:0,tls-creds=tls0
+
+.. _tls_005fpsk:
+
+TLS Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Instead of using certificates, you may also use TLS Pre-Shared Keys
+(TLS-PSK). This can be simpler to set up than certificates but is less
+scalable.
+
+Use the GnuTLS ``psktool`` program to generate a ``keys.psk`` file
+containing one or more usernames and random keys::
+
+   mkdir -m 0700 /tmp/keys
+   psktool -u rich -p /tmp/keys/keys.psk
+
+TLS-enabled servers such as qemu-nbd can use this directory like so::
+
+   qemu-nbd \
+     -t -x / \
+     --object tls-creds-psk,id=tls0,endpoint=server,dir=/tmp/keys \
+     --tls-creds tls0 \
+     image.qcow2
+
+When connecting from a qemu-based client you must specify the directory
+containing ``keys.psk`` and an optional username (defaults to "qemu")::
+
+   qemu-img info \
+     --object tls-creds-psk,id=tls0,dir=/tmp/keys,username=rich,endpoint=client \
+     --image-opts \
+     file.driver=nbd,file.host=localhost,file.port=10809,file.tls-creds=tls0,file.export=/

+
+Connecting USB devices
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+USB devices can be connected with the ``-device usb-...`` command line
+option or the ``device_add`` monitor command. Available devices are:
+
+``usb-mouse``
+   Virtual Mouse. This will override the PS/2 mouse emulation when
+   activated.
+
+``usb-tablet``
+   Pointer device that uses absolute coordinates (like a touchscreen).
+   This means QEMU is able to report the mouse position without having

+   Pass through the host device identified by bus and addr
+
+``usb-host,vendorid=vendor,productid=product``
+   Pass through the host device identified by vendor and product ID
+
+``usb-wacom-tablet``
+   Virtual Wacom PenPartner tablet. This device is similar to the

+
+``usb-braille,chardev=id``
+   Braille device. This will use BrlAPI to display the braille output on
+   a real or fake device referenced by id.
+
+``usb-net[,netdev=id]``
+   Network adapter that supports CDC ethernet and RNDIS protocols. id
+   specifies a netdev defined with ``-netdev â€¦,id=id``. For instance,

+.. _host_005fusb_005fdevices:
+
+Using host USB devices on a Linux host
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+WARNING: this is an experimental feature. QEMU will slow down when using
+it. USB devices requiring real time streaming (i.e. USB Video Cameras)
+are not supported yet.
+
+1. If you use an early Linux 2.4 kernel, verify that no Linux driver is
+   actually using the USB device. A simple way to do that is simply to
+   disable the corresponding kernel module by renaming it from
+   ``mydriver.o`` to ``mydriver.o.disabled``.
+
+2. Verify that ``/proc/bus/usb`` is working (most Linux distributions
+   should enable it by default). You should see something like that:
+
+   ::
+
+      ls /proc/bus/usb
+      001  devices  drivers
+
+3. Since only root can access to the USB devices directly, you can
+   either launch QEMU as root or change the permissions of the USB
+   devices you want to use. For testing, the following suffices:
+
+   ::
+
+      chown -R myuid /proc/bus/usb
+
+4. Launch QEMU and do in the monitor:
+
+   ::
+
+      info usbhost
+        Device 1.2, speed 480 Mb/s
+          Class 00: USB device 1234:5678, USB DISK
+
+   You should see the list of the devices you can use (Never try to use
+   hubs, it won't work).
+
+5. Add the device in QEMU by using:
+
+   ::
+
+      device_add usb-host,vendorid=0x1234,productid=0x5678
+
+   Normally the guest OS should report that a new USB device is plugged.
+   You can use the option ``-device usb-host,...`` to do the same.
+
+6. Now you can try to use the host USB device in QEMU.
+
+When relaunching QEMU, you may have to unplug and plug again the USB
+device to make it work again (this is a bug).

+
+VNC security
+------------
+
+The VNC server capability provides access to the graphical console of
+the guest VM across the network. This has a number of security
+considerations depending on the deployment scenarios.
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fnone:
+
+Without passwords
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The simplest VNC server setup does not include any form of
+authentication. For this setup it is recommended to restrict it to
+listen on a UNIX domain socket only. For example
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] -vnc unix:/home/joebloggs/.qemu-myvm-vnc
+
+This ensures that only users on local box with read/write access to that
+path can access the VNC server. To securely access the VNC server from a
+remote machine, a combination of netcat+ssh can be used to provide a
+secure tunnel.
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fpassword:
+
+With passwords
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The VNC protocol has limited support for password based authentication.
+Since the protocol limits passwords to 8 characters it should not be
+considered to provide high security. The password can be fairly easily
+brute-forced by a client making repeat connections. For this reason, a
+VNC server using password authentication should be restricted to only
+listen on the loopback interface or UNIX domain sockets. Password
+authentication is not supported when operating in FIPS 140-2 compliance
+mode as it requires the use of the DES cipher. Password authentication
+is requested with the ``password`` option, and then once QEMU is running
+the password is set with the monitor. Until the monitor is used to set
+the password all clients will be rejected.
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] -vnc :1,password -monitor stdio
+   (qemu) change vnc password
+   Password: ********
+   (qemu)
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fcertificate:
+
+With x509 certificates
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The QEMU VNC server also implements the VeNCrypt extension allowing use
+of TLS for encryption of the session, and x509 certificates for
+authentication. The use of x509 certificates is strongly recommended,
+because TLS on its own is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
+Basic x509 certificate support provides a secure session, but no
+authentication. This allows any client to connect, and provides an
+encrypted session.
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] \
+     -object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,dir=/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=server,verify-peer=no \
+     -vnc :1,tls-creds=tls0 -monitor stdio
+
+In the above example ``/etc/pki/qemu`` should contain at least three
+files, ``ca-cert.pem``, ``server-cert.pem`` and ``server-key.pem``.
+Unprivileged users will want to use a private directory, for example
+``$HOME/.pki/qemu``. NB the ``server-key.pem`` file should be protected
+with file mode 0600 to only be readable by the user owning it.
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fcertificate_005fverify:
+
+With x509 certificates and client verification
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Certificates can also provide a means to authenticate the client
+connecting. The server will request that the client provide a
+certificate, which it will then validate against the CA certificate.
+This is a good choice if deploying in an environment with a private
+internal certificate authority. It uses the same syntax as previously,
+but with ``verify-peer`` set to ``yes`` instead.
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] \
+     -object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,dir=/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=server,verify-peer=yes \
+     -vnc :1,tls-creds=tls0 -monitor stdio
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fcertificate_005fpw:
+
+With x509 certificates, client verification and passwords
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Finally, the previous method can be combined with VNC password
+authentication to provide two layers of authentication for clients.
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] \
+     -object tls-creds-x509,id=tls0,dir=/etc/pki/qemu,endpoint=server,verify-peer=yes \
+     -vnc :1,tls-creds=tls0,password -monitor stdio
+   (qemu) change vnc password
+   Password: ********
+   (qemu)
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fsasl:
+
+With SASL authentication
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The SASL authentication method is a VNC extension, that provides an
+easily extendable, pluggable authentication method. This allows for
+integration with a wide range of authentication mechanisms, such as PAM,
+GSSAPI/Kerberos, LDAP, SQL databases, one-time keys and more. The
+strength of the authentication depends on the exact mechanism
+configured. If the chosen mechanism also provides a SSF layer, then it
+will encrypt the datastream as well.
+
+Refer to the later docs on how to choose the exact SASL mechanism used
+for authentication, but assuming use of one supporting SSF, then QEMU
+can be launched with:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+
+   |qemu_system| [...OPTIONS...] -vnc :1,sasl -monitor stdio
+
+.. _vnc_005fsec_005fcertificate_005fsasl:
+
+With x509 certificates and SASL authentication
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If the desired SASL authentication mechanism does not supported SSF
+layers, then it is strongly advised to run it in combination with TLS
+and x509 certificates. This provides securely encrypted data stream,
+avoiding risk of compromising of the security credentials. This can be
+enabled, by combining the 'sasl' option with the aforementioned TLS +
+x509 options:
+
+.. parsed-literal::
+

+
+Configuring SASL mechanisms
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The following documentation assumes use of the Cyrus SASL implementation
+on a Linux host, but the principles should apply to any other SASL
+implementation or host. When SASL is enabled, the mechanism
+configuration will be loaded from system default SASL service config
+/etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running QEMU as an unprivileged user, an
+environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used to make it search
+alternate locations for the service config file.
+
+If the TLS option is enabled for VNC, then it will provide session
+encryption, otherwise the SASL mechanism will have to provide
+encryption. In the latter case the list of possible plugins that can be
+used is drastically reduced. In fact only the GSSAPI SASL mechanism
+provides an acceptable level of security by modern standards. Previous
+versions of QEMU referred to the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism, however, it has
+multiple serious flaws described in detail in RFC 6331 and thus should
+never be used any more. The SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism provides a simple
+username/password auth facility similar to DIGEST-MD5, but does not
+support session encryption, so can only be used in combination with TLS.
+
+When not using TLS the recommended configuration is
+
+::
+
+   mech_list: gssapi
+   keytab: /etc/qemu/krb5.tab
+
+This says to use the 'GSSAPI' mechanism with the Kerberos v5 protocol,
+with the server principal stored in /etc/qemu/krb5.tab. For this to work
+the administrator of your KDC must generate a Kerberos principal for the
+server, with a name of 'qemu/somehost.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM' replacing
+'somehost.example.com' with the fully qualified host name of the machine
+running QEMU, and 'EXAMPLE.COM' with the Kerberos Realm.
+
+When using TLS, if username+password authentication is desired, then a
+reasonable configuration is
+
+::
+
+   mech_list: scram-sha-1
+   sasldb_path: /etc/qemu/passwd.db
+
+The ``saslpasswd2`` program can be used to populate the ``passwd.db``
+file with accounts.
+
+Other SASL configurations will be left as an exercise for the reader.
+Note that all mechanisms, except GSSAPI, should be combined with use of
+TLS to ensure a secure data channel.
