I like this approach even if there is no consumer today. It does not
hurt, and it is indeed a motivation to develop consumers that care.

I personally find this much easier to swallow than any kind of crash on
deprecation, which already at the BoF seemed like a really big hammer to
kill a fly.

CC'ing Andrea as well, because we discussed recently about how to deal
with error checking in general, and if a new error checking framework is
being put in place, adding deprecation to the thinking could be a good
idea.
