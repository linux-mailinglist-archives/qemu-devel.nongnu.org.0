IMHO we shouldn't try to install anything from pip. It should all be
available from distro repos already. In fact if you have "virt-install"
or "virt-manager" installed, you should already have the required
python bits.

On RHEL/Fedora you need python3-gobject to get the GObject introspection
support and then all you need is the native gvnc library. There is no
python library for gvnc because GObject introspection makes this
redundant - the python API is dynamically created at runtime using
FFI to access the native library APIs.
