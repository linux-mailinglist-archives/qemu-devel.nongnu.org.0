AFAIK, we've never defined anything about QOM paths wrt ABI one way
or the other ? In the absence of guidelines then it comes down to
what are reasonable expectations of the mgmt app. These expectations
will be influenced by what it is actually possible to acheive given
our API as exposed.

I think it is unreasonable to expect /machine/unattached to be
stable because by its very nature it is just a dumping ground
for anything where the dev hasn't put in any thought to the path
placement.  IOW, it was/is definitely a bad idea for libvirt to
rely on /machine/unattached in any way. That we're liable to be
broken is not nice, but its really our own fault - we should 
have asked for a better solution from day one here.


I think it is somewhat reasonable to expect other QOM paths to
be stable as there's been some degree of thought put into their
placement. If we don't want apps to be considering other
paths to be stable, then we need to explain exactly what they
can and can't rely on, and most importantly actually provide
a way for them to do what they need


For example, libvirt needs a QOM path to query memory balloon
stats. All libvirt knows is that it set 'id=balloon0' when
creating it on the CLI. To find the balloon device in QOM it
then looks for all paths under '/machine/peripheral', and
tries to find one called 'child<$ID>' where $ID is the id=xxx
value from the CLI.

We do the same dance when we need to find out where thue
default VGA device we created lives.

This all feels kinda silly as we're going through a dance to
dynamically find the device, but in practice it is no better
than just hardcoding it.

The problem we face in these examp\les is that as an input we
are giving QMEU a device 'id' but at runtime we're needing to
then use a QOM path instead of the 'id'. So we need a way to
translate an 'id' to a QOM path. What is the right way to do
this in a supported manner without making any assumptions
about QOM paths ?


For the CPUs cases, we don't have any 'id' on the CLI since
CPUs aren't configured that way, so we just hardcoded the
full path. You've pointed out query-hotpluggable-cpus which
is a possible solution.

In another case we're assuming that '/machine' has a property
called 'rtc-time'. IMHO it is reasonable to assume that
'/machine' as a QOM path is stable.

It isn't as simple as just saying "all QOM paths are unstable".

I struggle to come up with a good rule to explain what apps can
/ can't rely on wrt QOM paths, other than stay far away from
anything with '/unattached'.

Daniel
