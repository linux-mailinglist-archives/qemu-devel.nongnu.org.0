Depends how flexible we want to be. Some enterprise organizations will
not allow use of 3rd party repos, even EPEL, only permitting to consume
software provided by Red Hat official repos.  I'm not too bothered though
as I doubt it will be a major problem with likely QEMU contributors. Thos=
e
restrictive organizations are not likely to allow developers to be involv=
ed
in upstream communities in the first place, nor consume releases direct
from upstream.

IOW, I think (c) is fine to allow maximum flexibility for upstream.

Daniel
