OK so it seems worth cleaning this up. I'm currently putting together a
patch set to support these large SVE registers and I'm cleaning up the
core gdbstub code while I go. If you are interested the current WIP
branch is:

  https://github.com/stsquad/qemu/commits/gdbstub/sve-registers

but I can include you on the review CC when I post (hopefully this
week)?
