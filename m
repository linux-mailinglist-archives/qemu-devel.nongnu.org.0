The artifacts would only be published if the CI job succeeds. If it fails
the artifacts from the previous successful job remain available.

Second, we don't need to run the CI continuously. It could be done once
a month, or could be triggered manually on demand. Or it could run
frequently, but we only publish artifacts from a manual invokation.
