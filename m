I was looking purely from a network driver perspective.

I had two options - either do a direct read/write as it does today or 
implement the ring/king semantics and read/write from that.

I decided to not bother with the latter and read/write directly from/to 
skbs.

Virtio in general no. UML specifically - yes. I have thought of mapping 
out all key device calls to RPCs for a few applications. The issue is 
that it is fairly difficult to make all of this function cleanly without 
blocking in strange places.

You may probably want to look at the UML UBD driver. That is an example 
of moving out all processing to an external thread and talking to it via 
a request/response API. While it still expects shared memory and needs 
access to UML address space the model should be more amenable to 
replacing various calls with RPCs as you have now left the rest of the 
kernel to run while you are processing the RPC. It also provides you 
with RPC completion interrupts, etc as a side effect.

So you basically have UML -> Thread -> RPCs -> Model?
