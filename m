Right; point-2-point doesn't worry me much as long as we're careful;
it's now we're suddenly proposing something much more general that
I think we need to start being really careful.

You can just drop the CAP_SYS_PTRACE on the whole lot for that;
I thought there was something for /proc/.../mem as well.
