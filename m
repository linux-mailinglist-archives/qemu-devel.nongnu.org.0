Title:
  QEMU installer with WHPX support

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  People often ask the community to add WHPX support to the QEMU installer =
for Windows,
  but it is impossible due to the license limitations of the WHPX SDK.

  The WinHvEmulation.h and WinHvPlatform.h header files needed are "All
  rights reserved".

  However these headers only contain struct definitions and integer constan=
ts,
  no functional code in macros or inline functions. See:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg645815.html
  It is questionable whether the headers alone can be considered copyrighta=
ble material.
