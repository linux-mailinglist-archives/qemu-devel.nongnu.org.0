bitmap mode is sync=3Dbitmap , as in the first sentence. if you set=20
sync=3Dbitmap, you must specify a bitmap and a bitmap-mode. if you use=20
another sync mode, you must not specify a bitmap or a bitmap-mode.

there is also a 'sugar' sync mode 'incremental' that desugars to=20
sync=3Dbitmap with bitmap-mode=3Don-success.  I guess that should also be=20
mentioned somewhere in QAPI, it's mainly there since MirrorSyncMode has=20
it as possible value, it's semantics are straight-forward to map onto=20
this combination, and it's how the sync modes are known from backup=20
jobs.

maybe the following is easier to understand and more aligned with=20
bitmap-mode:

The name of the bitmap to use for sync=3Dbitmap/sync=3Dincremental mode.=20
Must be present if sync is "bitmap" or "incremental". Must NOT be=20
present otherwise.

Specifies the type of data the bitmap should contain after the operation=20
concludes. Must be present if sync is "bitmap". Must be "on-success" or=20
absent if sync is "incremental". Must NOT be present otherwise.

yes.

we must use the same granularity as the sync bitmap passed in via=20
'bitmap', so the caller can't set a different one.

yes. with the addition of sync=3Dincremental as subset of sync=3Dbitmap, as=
