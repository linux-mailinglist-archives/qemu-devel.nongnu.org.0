Public bug reported:

I am trying to build static QEMU on Raspbian, chrooted into using systemd-n=
spawn with QEMU 4.0.0.
This is how my compiling looks:
https://pastebin.com/PYZYeRCN
Just the problematic part:
https://pastebin.com/7LxWPMxA
How I do the compiling:
https://pastebin.com/pYM17A6R (I plan to share this tutorial when it will w=
ork)
It is a coincidence, or the build fails because it cannot find lp11-kit. I =
did some symlinks:
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so.0 /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so.0
ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libp11-kit.so /usr/lib/libp11-kit.so
(should I also symlink libp11.so and libp11.so.2? I think I have installed =
all required p11 packages!
