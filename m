Thanks for the ping Peter, I forgot about this.

@Palmer I have taken your patches, made some changes based on Peter's
comments and rebased them on your PR branch.

I'll double check, but the hook implementation looks correct and I
can't see any other obvious unsanitised physical accesses so it should
be ok. I'll send them out today if I don't find any issues.
