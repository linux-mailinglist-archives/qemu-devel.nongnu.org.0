I have this exact issue with any VM using Spice audio redirection.
My setup has Linux (Fedora 32) as host and guest.
The Guest microphone freezes mid way through most video conferences, which =
is quite a pain.
I see the exact same error messages:

A bug was just triggered in audio_get_avail
Context:
audio: live=3D172895567 sw->hw->conv_buf->size=3D1920
A bug was just triggered in audio_pcm_hw_get_live_in
Context:
audio: live=3D172895567 hw->conv_buf->size=3D1920

Closing the spice client (Boxes or Virtmanager) and reconnecting sometimes =
restores microphone.
I have tried AC97 and HD Audio as virtual hardware and have the same result=
s, AC97 may be proving to be a little less failure prone, but I have not ha=
d enough events to be sure.

  This did not happen in Eoan (qemu 4.0.0). I was able to switch in/out
  of a VM with my audio coming through fine. I enabled Eoan in my
  sources.list, downgraded all my qemu packages, and the issue was
  resolved.

  This happens on the latest Windows 10 guest when a sound device is
  listening for the microphone.

  /var/log/libvirt/qemu/<vmname>.log spews this error out when I switch
  with evdev (which is just the keyboard and mouse, the audio is passed
  through I assume spice):
