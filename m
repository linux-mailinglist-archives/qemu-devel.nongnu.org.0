So.. I'm going to dispute this.  Or at least dispute that writing "the
firmware" as part of qemu isn't a feasible strategy.  At least in the
case of the "pseries" machine type, and possibly some other explicitly
paravirt machine types.

I do agree that we should leave firmware things to firmware when we're
implementing a real hardware platform and can therefore (at least in
theory) run the same firmware binary under qemu as for the real
hardware.

But "pseries" is different.  We're implementing the PAPR platform,
which describes an OS environment that's presented by a combination of
a hypervisor and firmware.  The features it specifies *require*
collaboration between the firmware and the hypervisor.

In PowerVM the environment is implemented with a substantial firmware
as well as hypervisor.  How those two communicate is in closed code,
it's not documented anywhere public, and I suspect it's not even
documented anywhere internal to IBM.

So, for qemu we've taken a different approach.  Since the beginning,
the runtime component of the firmware (RTAS) has been implemented as a
20 byte shim which simply forwards it to a hypercall implemented in
qemu.  The boottime firmware component is SLOF - but a build that's
specific to qemu, and has always needed to be updated in sync with
it.  Even though we've managed to limit the amount of runtime
communication we need between qemu and SLOF, there's some, and it's
become increasingly awkward to handle as we've implemented new features.

So really, the question isn't whether we implement things in firmware
or in qemu.  It's whether we implement the firmware functionality as
guest cpu code, which needs to be coded to work with a limited
environment, built with a special toolchain, then emulated with TCG.
Or, do we just implement it in normal C code, with a full C library,
and existing device and backend abstractions inside qemu.

That's what killing slof is about.
