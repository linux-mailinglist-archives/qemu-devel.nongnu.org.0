Moving the documentation for both qemu-img and qemu-nbd to tools/ 
instead of interop/ makes sense to me.  I don't know if qemu-io is 
documented well (it's more of an internal tool than a user-visible 
tool), but it could also live in tools/.

As it is, I would love to move toplevel/qemu-nbd.c into a 
tools/qemu-nbd.c directory.  But when I spent a mere 30 minutes seeing 
what it would take, I quickly learned that there is enough arcane 
Makefile magic going on in building from subdirectories that it wasn't 
worth my time to figure out how, especially if all that magic gets 
rewritten anyway during Paolo's conversion to meson.
