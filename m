Uh, that's already in Rcs. *hurries*

Not empty: `&& length > 0`. The 2nd part of the disjunction already
implies it (as it is `length == max`) so I only added it to the first
part. A pointless optimization on my part given that it's supposed to be
more easily verified against the comment, so I'll change it to be
clearer: ($condition_without_'-1') && (!g_queue_is_empty()), so:

    bool need_resume = (!qmp_oob_enabled(mon) ||
        mon->qmp_requests->length == QMP_REQ_QUEUE_LEN_MAX)
        && !g_queue_is_empty(mon->qmp_requests);

will do.
