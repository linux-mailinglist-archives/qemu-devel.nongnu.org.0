I like to think of it as "This CPU exposes an environment that looks
like KVM, so it implements HVC calls (EL2) and is responsible for
handling SMC calls as well.

The main difference between the two semantics is that in yours, you
don't have EL3. In mine, there is an EL3, but it's virtualized by the
same layer that implements EL2.

I don't think there can be a real SBBR compatible CPU without EL2/EL3,
because PSCI is a base requirement. That means either SMC calls succeed
(Windows running in EL2) or SMC calls are trapped into EL2 and it's up
to the hypervisor to decide what to do with them.

The patch fixes the default environment, which is "Conduit HVC, PSCI
over HVC implemented by QEMU". If the patch description wasn't clear,
I'm happy to reword it :).
