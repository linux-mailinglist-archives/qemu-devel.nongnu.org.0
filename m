Ok, let me check if we could cannibalize q35 pci-host for the task or
it would be easier to extend MMIO cpu-hotplug interface.
I'll probably come back with questions about how OVMF uses pci-host later.

considering above we are pretty much stuck with broadcast SMI mode
for standard UEFI interfaces. So for starters we can use it for CPU
hotplug as well (I think it's not possible to trigger directed SMI
from GPE handler and no nice way to implement it comes to my mind so far)

Broadcast SMI by itself does not present any problems to normal hotplug
flow. Even if there are several hotplugged CPUs, SMI# will be only pending
on all of them and host CPU can serialize them by waking one CPU at a time
by sending INIT-INIT-SIPI. Once one CPU is relocated, host CPU may wake up
the next one the same way ...

Lets try it, if it won't work out we will invent 'parking' feature in QEMU.
Considering that an attack scenario, it is probably fine to even avoid
attempts to recover from collision if it happens and just do machine wide
reset once detected that CPU is using not its own SMBASE.
This way locking might be not needed.

In case of 'parking' I see 2 possible ways:
   1: on CPU hotplug inhibit other CPUs hotplug in QEMU (device_add cpu) and
      wait until firmware permits it. (relatively simple to implement witho=
ut
      affecting CPU/KVM code)
      downside is that's not nice to upper layers as they will start getting
      transient errors while previously hotplugged CPU is being relocated.

   2: implement parked 'CPU' feature, which as I think in practice means
      ignore or queue SIPI and process it only when allowed (which is out
      of spec behavior). That probably would require changes not only to
      QEMU but to KVM as well.
