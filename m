not yet in qemu.

Maybe if you want to catch up on the topic, looking at the very first
kernel RFC may be a good starting point. Motivation, pros & cons were
discussed in that thread (hey, April 2017!)
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2017-April/021217.html

on ARM we have SMMUv3 emulation. But the VFIO integration is not
possible because SMMU does not have any "caching mode" and my nested
paging kernel series is blocked. So the only solution to integrate with
VFIO is looming virtio-iommu.

In general the pros that were put forward are: virtio-iommu is
architecture agnostic, removes the burden to accurately model complex
device states, driver can support virtualization specific optimizations
without being constrained by production driver maintenance. Cons is perf
and mem footprint if we do not consider any optimization.

You can have a look at

Not Yet. At the moment we are stuck with the non DT integration at
kernel level. We can instantiate the device in machvirt with DT boot only.

Work is ongoing on kernel, by Jean-Philippe to support non DT integration:

[1] [PATCH 0/3] virtio-iommu on non-devicetree platforms
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-virtualization/msg41391.html)

This does nor rely on ACPI anymore.

Originally the plan was to integrate with ACPI (IORT) but Michael pushed
to pass the binding info between the protected devices and the IOMMU
through the PCI cfg space. Also this could serve environments where we
do not have ACPI. I think some people are reluctant to expose the
virtio-iommu in the [IORT] ACPI table.

But definitively the end goal is to support the virtio-iommu for other
archs. Integration with x86 is already working based on IORT or [1].


 If so, is it a better choice than

I think We are still at the early stage and this would be premature even
if feasible.

Hope it helps

Thanks
