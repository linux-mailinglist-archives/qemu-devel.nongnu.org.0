Does it work with the capstone-supplied --cflags and the proposed
include path?  What does pkg-config --cflags capstone return there?

I don't think this deserves the complexity really, unless there *is*
a system out there which actually needs this.

I mean, these little compat tweaks, - it becomes twisty with time,
and no one knows which code paths and config variables are needed
for what, and whole thing slowly becomes unmanageable... If it's
easy to make it unconditional, it should be done. IMHO anyway :)

Thanks!
