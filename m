Hey Thomas,

Thanks for the in-depth response! I appreciate it a lot!

I am pretty familiar with the x86 architecture since I have worked with
processors right from 8086 to the Pentium line of processors. I have a nice
familiarity with x86_64. I have a passing familiarity with ARM and SPARC
architectures, but not much more. So I think I would like to focus on the
x86 architecture. I'll poke around the hw/ directory. Please feel free to
give me pointers in the meanwhile.

Since I am new to the community, I wanted to make sure if it is fine if I
post general questions to the mailing list and copy you? I see that all the
posts in the mailing list are mostly patches and nothing else.

Thanks,
Rohit.
