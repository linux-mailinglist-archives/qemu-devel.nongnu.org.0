Before we migrate hundreds of bugs around, I think we should first check
which ones are stale, and which are still valid. So for all bugs that are in
"New" state and older than, let's say 2 years, I think we should add a
message a la:

 The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and
which could be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now. If you still think this bug report here is valid, then
please switch the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise
this report will be marked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the
inconvenience.

Then set the state to "Incomplete" and wait and see how many bugs expire in
60 days.

As a start, we could use the bug list from my QEMU bug dashboard here:

 http://people.redhat.com/~thuth/qemu/bugs-dashboard.html

See the "Expired" tab for the list with old bugs.

PS: I think we should also not migrate the bugs marked with "Wishlist" ...
if people are interested in new features, they should either contribute code
or pay for support, but opening feature requests often simply get ignored
completely, so we should likely rather close them now, too, instead of
migrating them.
