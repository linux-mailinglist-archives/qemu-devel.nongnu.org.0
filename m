In the vhost-user client it gets a bit tricky because the setmemtable
command doesn't give differences - it gives a whole mapping table; so
the way libvhost-user does it is to perform a whole new set of mappings.
While the qemu and kernel side doesn't see any change, the mappings do
change in the client.  This probably needs a protocol improvement.

Yeh, I think use of that new memory isn't that bad.
