Can't argue with that :)

To be precise: our own DSL *syntax*.  Semantics is a separate question
to be skeptical about.

JSON is a exceptionally poor choice for a DSL, or even a configuration
language.

Correcting our mistake involves a flag day and a re-learn.  We need to
weigh costs against benefits.

The QAPI schema language has two layers:

* JSON, with a lexical and a syntactical sub-layer (both in parser.py)

* QAPI, with a context-free and a context-dependend sub-layer (in
  expr.py and schema.py, respectively)

Replacing the JSON layer is possible as long as the replacement is
sufficiently expressive (not a tall order).

Agree.

Stress on *can* load.  Doesn't mean we should.

Ancient prior art: Lisp programs routinely use s-expressions as
configuration file syntax.  They don't load them as code, they read them
as data.

With Python, it's ast.parse(), I think.

StrictYAML insists on quotes.

I hate having to quote identifiers.  There's a reason we don't write

    'int'
    'main'('int', 'argc', 'char' *'argv'[])
    {
        'printf'("hello world\n");
        return 0;
    }

Required reading on YAML:
https://www.arp242.net/yaml-config.html

Some of the criticism there doesn't matter for our use case.
