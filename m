That=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m asking.

At any point in time yes, but not over the time span of the change.  The
definition doesn=E2=80=99t say that the node represents the contents of a d=
isk
at a specific point, but the view from the parent.

I argue that that view is always over some period of time, so if you
suddenly switch out the whole disk, then it isn=E2=80=99t a self-consistent=
 view.

Alternatively, we could of course also just forego the permission system
here altogether and just check that there are no other parents at all.
(Which is effectively the same as unsharing CONSISTENT_READ.)
