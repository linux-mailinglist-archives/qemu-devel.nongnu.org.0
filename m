This series is an attempt to provide device memory hotplug support 
on ARM virt platform. This is based on Eric's recent works here[1]
and carries some of the pc-dimm related patches dropped from his
series.

The kernel support for arm64 memory hot add was added recently by
Robin and hence the guest kernel should be => 5.0-rc1.

NVDIM support is not included currently as we still have an unresolved
issue while hot adding NVDIMM[2]. However NVDIMM cold plug patches
can be included, but not done for now, for keeping it simple.

This makes use of GED device to sent hotplug ACPI events to the
Guest. GED code is based on Nemu. Thanks to the efforts of Samuel and
Sebastien to add the hardware-reduced support to Nemu using GED
device[3]. (Please shout if I got the author/signed-off wrong for
those patches or missed any names).

This is sanity tested on a HiSilicon ARM64 platform and appreciate
any further testing.

Thanks,
Shameer

v6 --> v7
- Added 4.2 machine support and restricted GED creation for < 4.2
  This is to address the migration test fail reported by Eric.
- Included "tests: Update DSDT ACPI table.." patch(#10) from Eric
  to fix the "make check" bios-tables-test failure.
  
v5 --> v6

-Addressed comments from Eric.
-Added R-by from Eric and Igor.

v4 --> v5
-Removed gsi/ged-irq routing in virt.
-Added Migration support.
-Dropped support for DT coldplug case based on the discussions
 here[4]
-Added system_powerdown support through GED.

v3 --> v4
Addressed comments from Igor and Eric,
-Renamed "virt-acpi" to "acpi-ged".
-Changed ged device parent to TYPE_DEVICE.
-Introduced DT memory node property "hotpluggable" to resolve device
 memory being treated as early boot memory issue(patch #7).
-Combined patches #3 and #9 from v3 into #3.

v2 --> v3

Addressed comments from Igor and Eric,
-Made virt acpi device platform independent and moved
 to hw/acpi/generic_event_device.c
-Moved ged specific code into hw/acpi/generic_event_device.c
-Introduced an opt-in feature "fdt" to resolve device-memory being
 treated as early boot memory.
-Dropped patch #1 from v2.

RFC --> v2

-Use GED device instead of GPIO for ACPI hotplug events.
-Removed NVDIMM support for now.
-Includes dropped patches from Eric's v9 series.
