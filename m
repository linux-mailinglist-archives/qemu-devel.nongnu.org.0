So is writing the function arguments with indentation. Then I don't see
much difference between a long list of arguments in a struct and that
function. The main difference is that you make it easy to pass those
arguments down. But often, you want to pass a subset, you don't want to
pass the whole context as it may lead to bad design / bugs.

Sure they could be better, they are still quite idiomatic for C.

Regardless of bindings, the client as a whole should obey the rules of

Hmm? I am trying to make the hole a bit more regular...

It's relevant. Did you study varlink a bit? It's so close to QMP, you will
find it hard to point out real dissimilarities.

&gt;&gt; small thing.=C2=A0 And other RPCs have evolved in a completely dif=
ferent<br>
&gt;&gt; space (REST APIs for web services) that have chosen the same trade=

&gt; I don&#39;t buy that generalization. A very recent protocol in this sp=

&gt; here, for what I could tell. Although they use JSON, and have similar<=

Paolo pointed out successful protocols that make tradeoffs similar to<br>
QMP to support the idea that these tradeoffs can make sense and are<br>
workable.<br>

Pointing out other, dissimilar protocols is not a convincing<br>
counter-argument :)<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s relevant. =
Did you study varlink a bit? It&#39;s so close to QMP, you will find it har=
