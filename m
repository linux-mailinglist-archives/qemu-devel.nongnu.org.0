Ping?

I'd like to know whether there's any high level comment about all
these... Considering that the kernel counterpart is still during
review, I guess we don't need to spend much time on that much,
assuming it'll be a ring of dirty addresses.  The rest should be
irrelevant to kernel so I'd glad to know if there's comments on those
parts.

Thanks,
