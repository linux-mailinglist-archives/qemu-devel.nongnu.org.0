I just noticed we have a MachineClass::fixup_ram_size() handler. There
is only one implementation (on s390x) which does a bit the opposite:
If the user asks for -m 1400, it will pad to a valid physical size,
so in your example to 1472 MiB. Then the guest can use only 1400 if it
is happy with it. 72 MiB are wasted, but this is still better than the
576 MiB wasted if we were using 2 GiB instead ;)

See commit 5c30ef937f5:

static ram_addr_t s390_fixup_ram_size(ram_addr_t sz)
{
    /* same logic as in sclp.c */
    int increment_size = 20;
    ram_addr_t newsz;

    while ((sz >> increment_size) > MAX_STORAGE_INCREMENTS) {
        increment_size++;
    }
    newsz = sz >> increment_size << increment_size;

    if (sz != newsz) {
        qemu_printf("Ram size %" PRIu64 "MB was fixed up to %" PRIu64
                    "MB to match machine restrictions. "
                    "Consider updating "
                    "the guest definition.\n", (uint64_t) (sz / MiB),
                    (uint64_t) (newsz / MiB));
    }
    return newsz;
}
