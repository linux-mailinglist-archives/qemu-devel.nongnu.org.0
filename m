Hi,

I've been following Alexander's fuzzing changes from the GSoC
project, and it's looking like an excellent start on the
introduction of fuzzing into the world of Qemu/KVM.

I had a couple of off-list e-mails with Stefan and Alexander, to get
some idea of what the intent was going forward, and it was suggested
that we should discuss things in the open on the list to allow
everyone to contribute.

Unfortunately, I'm probably not going to be able to make it to the
KVMForum at the end of the month, so guess I'll have to settle for
e-mail for now :)

It is my understanding that the primary focus is to work on a
solution that would permit integration into Google's OSSFuzz
service[1] to allow for continuous fuzzing and automatic reporting
of issues found.

Once Alexander lands his patches, things will be 1 step closer to
this goal.

The question then is, well what next?

From what Stefan said to me, the intention is to work on expanding
the scope of the fuzzing, adding more test cases for a wider range
of machine and devices types.

I hope to be able to help out here, since this is an area that I'm
also interested in with my work in Oracle Linux's virtualization
team.

How would you like to move forward? Is there an ordered list of
device or machines that we'd like to focus on anywhere? If not,
could we create one?

Thanks,

Darren.
