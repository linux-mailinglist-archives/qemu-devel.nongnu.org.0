Ah yes, I forgot you had done that already, which is nice.

IME magic like this has a habit of coming back to bite you. eg if we late=
r
find there is some use case where its important to /really/ use /dev/uran=
dom
and we've magically turned /dev/urandom into a call to gnutls, we're stuc=
k.

If we want to use qcrypto_random_bytes we must have an explicit way to ge=
t
that, rather than changing semantics of existing filenames apps might be
passing.
