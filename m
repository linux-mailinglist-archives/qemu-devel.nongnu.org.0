I'm not sure how much of a problem it is in practice, and whether we
can consider the vhost-user client trusted. But using QIOChannel from
within a coroutine just avoids the problem completely, so it feels like
a natural choice to just do that.

You need to run the actual block I/O requests in the iothread where the
block device happens to run. So if you move the message processing to a
separate thread, you would have to communicate between threads for the
actual request processing. Possible, but probably slower than necessary
and certainly more complex.
