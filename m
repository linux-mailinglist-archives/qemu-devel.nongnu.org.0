Hi, Palmer

Maybe it is the headache of open source hardware. Everyone cooperates to 
build a better architecture.

In my opinion, we should focus on the future. The code in QEMU mainline 
should evolve to the  ratified extension step by step, and only support 
the best extension at last.

At that time,  even many hardwares just support  the deprecated draft 
extension,  the draft codes should be in the wild and maintained by the 
hardware manufactures.

But before that,  it is better to  have a draft implementation. So that 
We can work step by step to accelerate the coming of the ratified 
extension.

Even at last draft extension implementation are deprecated, they are not 
meaningless. The manufactures may use  the  history commit to support 
their hardwares that

only support drafted extension.

Zhiwei
