I can do that - we have other tests that link to libm.

I was expecting to see more breakage but the ppc64 tests all passed (or
at least against the power8 David ran it on). What am I missing to hit
the cases you know are broken?

I've also experimented with reducing the number of iterations because if
we want to have golden references we probably don't want to dump several
hundred kilobytes of "golden" references into the source tree.

Hmm I guess - look a bit weird but I guess that's lack of familiarity.
Is is still normalised? I guess the frac shows up (without the implicit
bit).

Title:
  ppc: softfloat float implementation issues

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

  Per bug #1841491, Richard Henderson (rth) said:
