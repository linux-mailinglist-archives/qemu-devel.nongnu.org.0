I don't think the implementations for both things are too similar, so
you might just end up having two if branches and then two separate
implementations in the block drivers.

If anything, bdrv_make_empty() is more related to discard than
write_zeroes. But we use the discard code for it in qcow2 only as a
fallback because in the most common cases, making an image completely
empty means effectively just creating an entirely new L1 and refcount
table, which is much faster than individually discarding all clusters.

For bdrv_make_zero() I don't see an opportunity for such optimisations,
so I don't really see a reason to have a separate callback. Unless you
do know one?

Kevin
