It doesn't seem to be the same issue.  Even if the console socket is closed,
I'm seeing results similar to the ones reported by Peter (the "pkgin -y

Running with V=1, I see packages being downloaded at reasonable speeds, but
there's a huge interval (of various minutes) between each package download.
