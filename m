So, what's different for it vs passing through a physical hardware via VFIO?
even though the features are negotiated dynamically, could you explain
why it would cause software_version not work?

that's why some attributes need to be common. e.g.
device_api: it's common because mgmt need to know it's a pci device or a
            ccw device. and the api type is already defined vfio.h.
	    (The field is agreed by and actually suggested by Alex in previous mail)
type: mdev_type for mdev. if mgmt does not understand it, it would not
      be able to create one compatible mdev device.
software_version: mgmt can compare the major and minor if it understands
      this fields.

yes, it's just NVMe specific. I added it as an example to show what is
vendor specific.
if one attribute is vendor specific across all vendors, then it's not vendor specific,
it's already common attribute, right?

some parts need to be common, as I listed above.

some Intel devices have bitmask based capability registers.
so what?
we have defined pci_id to identify the devices.
even two different devices have equal PCI IDs, we still allow them to
add vendor specific fields. e.g.
for QAT, they can add alg_set to identify hardware supported algorithms.

if the device is binding to vfio or vfio-mdev, I believe this interface
is not there.
