Maybe that would work for distros, but I don't think that these are good 
options for the average users who just want to download and recompile the 
latest version of QEMU on their own.
I assume that most users don't have an environment with cross-compilers or 
for running things in a container, so I think they still want to use the 
pre-built binaries. Thus, if you bundle the binaries along with their 
sources, people will still continue to download the big tarball and we 
haven't gained anything.

So do you really really think shipping the binaries in the main tarball is a 
problem? Honestly, it's not a problem for us as long as we publish both 
tarballs together - and if someone wants to mirror the main tarball to their 
webserver and fails to mirror the rom-sources tarball, too, it's their 
fault, not ours.

Anyway, what about splitting the binaries into a separate tarball, so we 
would have three tarballs:

     qemu-x.y.z.tar.xz               (QEMU source only)
     qemu-roms-x.y.z.tar.xz          (ROM binaries)
     qemu-roms-sources-x.y.z.tar.xz  (ROM sources)

That should make it hopefully obvious that the two qemu-roms* tarballs 
belong together. Would that be OK for you?
