That was precisely the topic of my RFC question.

I _do_ think it is simpler to report that 'all clusters where content=20
comes from _this_ image read as zero', leaving unallocated clusters as=20
zero only if 1. there is no backing image, or 2. the backing image also=20
reads as all zero (recursing as needed).  I'll spin v2 of these patches=20
along those lines, although I'm hoping for more review on the rest of=20
the series, first.

I really want the definition to be 'any cluster whose contents come from=20
this layer' (the qemu-io definition of allocated, not necessarily the=20
qcow2 definition of allocated), which picks up BOTH types of qcow2 zero=20
clusters (those preallocated but marked 0, where the contents of the=20
allocated area are indeterminate but never read, and those unallocated=20
but marked 0 which do not defer to the backing layer).  Whether or not=20
the cluster is allocated is less important than whether the image reads=20
as 0 at that cluster.

But I think that you are right that an alternative definition of 'all=20
allocated clusters are zero' will give the same results when crawling=20
through the backing chain to learn if the overall image reads as zero,=20
and that's all the more that we can expect out of this bit.

The earlier parts of this series which renamed bdrv_has_zero_init() into=20
bdrv_known_zeroes() does just that - it already handles recursion=20
through the backing chain, and insists that an image is all zeroes with=20
respect to BDRV_ZERO_OPEN only if all layers of the backing chain agree.
