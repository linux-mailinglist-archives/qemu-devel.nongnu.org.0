This poses a problem with the unification strategy you suggested for qmp
commands and transactions. I guess that, if we really want to preserve
the original behavior, we can extend DriveBackup to add a flag to
indicate whether the transaction should create a drained section or not.

Does this sound reasonable to you?

Sergio.
