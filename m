Given this design question around the integration into blockdev, I'd
suggest splitting the series into two parts.

One series should do all the work in crypto/ code to support adding
and erasing key slots.

One series should focus on block/ layer QMP/qemu-img integration.

The block layer QAPI stuff shouldn't leak into the crypto/ code.

So this will let us get on with reviewing & unit testing the
crypto code, while we discuss block layer design options in more
detail.

Daniel
