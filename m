object_class_property_add_uint*_ptr() is similar to what we have in QDEV
properties already implemented. But that is all hidden behind macro
magic, so users aren't using it directly.

But what I dislike the most is adding _class_ variants of those with
offsets exposed to users call site without any type checking.
It might be easier and safer to make current QDEV properties to work
with Object in one go, instead of duplication small parts of it in
object_foo() API.
But then I haven't actually tried so ...
