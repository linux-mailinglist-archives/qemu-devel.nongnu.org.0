To be honest, I really hope the number of APIC ID initialization
variations won't grow in the future.

In either case, X86MachineState really doesn't seem to be the
right place to save the function pointers.  Whether we choose a
boolean flag or a collection of function pointers, model-specific
information belong to x86CPUClass and/or X86CPUDefinition, not
MachineState.

See the reply I sent at:

] If you need a CPU model to provide special behavior,
] you have two options:
]=20
] * Add a method pointer to X86CPUClass and/or X86CPUDefinition
] * Add a QOM property to enable/disable special behavior, and
]   include the property in the CPU model definition.
]=20
] The second option might be preferable long term, but might
] require more work because the property would become visible in
] query-cpu-model-expansion and in the command line.  The first
] option may be acceptable to avoid extra user-visible complexity
] in the first version.
