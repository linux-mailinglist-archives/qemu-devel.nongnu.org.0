This adds a new feature bit; where is the corresponding patch to qcow2.c 
to advertise the feature bit name in the optional feature name table?

/me reads ahead

good, patch 25 covers it.  Quick comment added there as a result.

Grammar; I'd suggest:

...don't have subclusters, so they are treated the same as in images 
without this feature.

Are they truly the same, or do you still need to document that the extra 
64 bits of the extended L2 entry are all zero?

Missing trailing '.'

Why must the allocation bit be unset?  When we preallocate, we want a 
cluster to reserve space, but still read as zero, so the combination of 
both bits set makes sense to me.

Our review is late; you could add 2020 if desired, now.
