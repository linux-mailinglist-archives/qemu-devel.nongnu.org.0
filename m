Just wanted to add a thought we had with Fabiano a few days ago:

experimentally, it is clear that fixed-ram is an optimization, but the actual scalability seems to come from the successive parallel I/O with multifd.

Since the goal is being able to transfer _to disk_ (fdatasync) the whole 30G memory in 5 seconds, the need to split the cpu-intensive work into smaller tasks remains,
and the main scalability solution seems to come from the multifd part of the work (or another way to split the problem), combined with the O_DIRECT friendliness to avoid the trap of the cache trashing.

Not adding much, just highlighting that fixed-ram _alone_ does not seem to suffice, we probably need all pieces of the puzzle in place.

Thanks!
