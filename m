Please quote the preemptive note in full.  I wasted several minutes
looking for it in the supposedly full saga, and in GLib git.  I still
have absolutely no clue what QEMU is doing wrong.

If I read the saga's "Subject: PR/54310 CVS commit: pkgsrc/devel/glib2"
part correctly, the GHashTable improvements have been or are being
removed.  Correct?
