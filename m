cpu->model is NULL. That fact (and xcc->is_best) is checked when the=20
model is to be used (e.g., via qmp or when creating VCPUs), and a rather=20
generic error is reported. This is suboptimal and ...

... doing something like that makes a lot of sense. We also have to=20
rework this for the "host" and "max" model.

I'll look into that when I'm back from holidays in one week.

Thanks!
