I was going to say that's a limtation of the use of virtio-serial, and
to some extent that is true, but it is also not true. There is no reason
it had to limit itselt to 1 virtio-serial device. It would have been
valid to have 1 virtio-serial device for the system level functionality,
and then 1 virtio-serial device per guest seat. Any guest OS configured
for multi-seat is already going to have extra devices added to QEMU
for each seat, so adding a virtio-serial device per seat would have
been easy enough and avoided the crazy proxying.

Ultimately that all says we need a "remote desktop agent", which is
extensible to other desktop integration features. Essentially that
is what the spice agent was aiming to provide.

virtio-serial does make it a bit easier to have the host backend side
self-contained in QEMU though. I think it is nice that nothing else on
the host ever sees the agent backend, as it is a private internal channel
between SPICE & QEMU's virtio-serial impl via the special chardev type.

vsock gets exposed to the host OS in general, and though you
can have QEMU open the vsock device internally, it feels a bit silly to
have one part of QEMU writing to a vsock device, and then another part
of QEMU reading back from the very same device. Especially because you
have now introduced the extra problem of having to allocate unique
vsock addresses for each instance and deal with possibility of external
apps maliciously trying to interact with your vsock backend.

As above though, I think the way spice used virtio-serial was suboptimal
and it should have had one extra virtio-serial device per seat.

Speaking DBus is only useful though if the guest desktop actually implements
the DBus interfaces that we're speaking. The remote desktop clipboard work
shown above is only going to be available on modern Linux guest OS, and
possibly only a subset of them. IOW on the guest side, we're going to have
to have platform specific backends to do the integration in whatever way
is best suited for each OS. I see windows, macos, android, Wayland and
X11 as distinct backends for the guest side.

The same on the host client side, though in that case it is all magically
handled by GTK for us, so we don't need to care about the platform
differences ourselves.
