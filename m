Arm SystemReady now defines BSA as the generic hardware requirements for
which S(erver)BSA is a special case. It feels like there are three use
cases driving three different QEMU platforms:
- virt =3D FW:{Qemu}, simple cloud native workloads,
- sbsa =3D HW:{watchdog, random number generator, secure flash, TPM, BMC?..=
.}
FW:{EDK2, KASLR, SecureBoot capabilities} --> developer vehicle for sbbr
- bsa =3D HW:{watchdog, random number generator, secure flash...}
FW:{U-boot,TF-A, OP-TEE, firmwareTPM} --> developer vehicle for ebbr, may
be automotive workloads to have virtual TAs/TPMs
I also think that ultimately SCP (
https://github.com/ARM-software/SCP-firmware) may end up running in the
context of QEMU.
