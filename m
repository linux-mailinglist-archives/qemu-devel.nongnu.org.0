Hi,

These are some rather selfish iotests patches.  The first patch helps me
personally because I tend to run the tests over SSH and forget to set
$DISPLAY.  That makes test 139 skip the tests annotated with
skip_if_unsupprted(), because iotests.py can no longer determine the
list of whitelisted formats.

Patches 2 through 5 are specifically for RHEL.  We have not whitelisted
null-aio, so it would be nice if tests didn=E2=80=99t require it.  Sorry,=
 I
don=E2=80=99t have a better reason to give.
In all seriousness, null-co is used widely in many tests, it basically
is our standard null driver.  Tests should prefer it over null-aio, just
for consistency alone.  It is not completely unreasonable to treat
null-aio as optional.  I guess.


v2:
- Allow tests to use the unittest module=E2=80=99s skipTest() so it is po=
ssible
  to skip a test case in the setUp() method (new patch 3).  Then use
  this in patches 4 and 5 to skip all null-aio cases instead of falling
  back to null-co and thus running tests twice.

- Patch 1 needed to be rebased on
  4a715461c8eab628e79b1e6889d650455e043b88
  (=E2=80=9Ctests/qemu-iotests/check: Pick a default machine if necessary=
=E2=80=9D)
