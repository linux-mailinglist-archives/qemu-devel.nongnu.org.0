The reason why this structure was removed was that it wasn't
MachineState object but a random structure which was a common
pattern in pre-QOM qemu.

Code was allocating 's', assigning pointer to s->a10 member and
then happily loosing both pointers in the end.

Since rewriting such "states" to objects derived from
MachineState was out of scope of memory-backend refactoring
I've opted to in favor of simplified cleanup, which removes
at least 1 lost pointer. This way however touches that code
again to store some additional board state or actually fix
pre-existing a10 object_new leak, could be asked to use
MachineState derived object for that.

So patch isn't changing anything in terms of lost pointers
or proper board modeling.

I can convert it to MachineState derived board as
an example to follow.

But it would be best if target/board maintainers would
take care of other boards to MachineState objects
across respective targets, to get rid of legacy examples
so it won't be copied later on.

In some cases it's trivial (like with this board) but in
other cases it's a bit more complicated (Like Philippe
did with RPi boards).
