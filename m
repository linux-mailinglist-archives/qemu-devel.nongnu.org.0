I don't think this is an improvement.

The commit message matches a pattern "what's wrong, since when, impact,
how is it fixed".  The pattern has become habit for me.  Its "what's
wrong" part is strictly local.  The non-local argument comes in only
when we assess impact.

Use of "would" in the what part's conditional signals the condition is
unlikely.  True (it's actually impossible), but distracting (because it
involves the non-local argument I'm not yet ready to make).

Let me try a different phrasing below.

Works fine for me.  I didn't mean any disrespect --- I'd have to
disrespect myself: the mess corrected by PATCH 10 is mine.

Feel free to call it "issue" rather than "bug".  I don't care, but David
might.

Tweaking the non-s390x commit messages as well would be nicer, but
requires a respin.

Let's try to craft a mutually agreeable commit message for this patch.
Here's my attempt:

    s390x: Fix query-cpu-model-FOO error API violations

    cpu_model_from_info() is a helper for qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion(),
    qmp_query_cpu_model_comparison(), qmp_query_cpu_model_baseline().  It
    dereferences @errp when the visitor or the QOM setter fails.  That's
    wrong; see the big comment in error.h.  Introduced in commit
    137974cea3 's390x/cpumodel: implement QMP interface
    "query-cpu-model-expansion"'.

    Its three callers have the same issue.  Introduced in commit
    4e82ef0502 's390x/cpumodel: implement QMP interface
    "query-cpu-model-comparison"' and commit f1a47d08ef 's390x/cpumodel:
    implement QMP interface "query-cpu-model-baseline"'.

    No caller actually passes null.  To fix, splice in a local Error *err,
    and error_propagate().

Adapting it to other patches should be straightforward.
