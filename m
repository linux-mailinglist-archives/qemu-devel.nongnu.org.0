Yes, but the test already involves a header extension.

Well, but the test currently doesn=E2=80=99t involve any known feature bits=
.
It=E2=80=99s mostly about checking what our qcow2 driver does with unknown
feature bits.

(If it wanted to involve known feature bits, it could have easily used
e.g. the dirty feature.)

But then we need to compare the qcow2 files themselves, and that doesn=E2=
=80=99t
work precisely because of the cp.

(I suppose we could work around it by sprinkling a dose of option
parsing, qemu-img amend, etc. on it, but I don=E2=80=99t see the point.)

I=E2=80=99d suspect 244 is the better place to put such tests.

That isn=E2=80=99t what I mean.  This test lets a data cluster point into t=
he
refcount structure; with an external data file, it wouldn=E2=80=99t actuall=
y
point into the metadata, because all data clusters must be in the
external file, so there=E2=80=99s no corruption then.

To my knowledge, we=E2=80=99ve kind of given up on detecting loops because =

Well, in any case it=E2=80=99d be something for a completely new test case.

This wouldn=E2=80=99t work because no node is supposed to know its parents.=
  So
it can=E2=80=99t distinguish between the two =E2=80=9Coutputs=E2=80=9D.

We=E2=80=99d need a shared state somewhere and then two different blkdebug
instances that access it with some runtime option to tell each one what
it=E2=80=99s supposed to do.  But that=E2=80=99s what I mean by =E2=80=9Cme=
ss=E2=80=9D. :-)

We simply never inject errors on the backing file. (AFAIK)

One would also need to adjust the qcow2 file to point to the copied data
file.

Yep, and it=E2=80=99s definitely good to have a kind of external perspectiv=

it. :-)
