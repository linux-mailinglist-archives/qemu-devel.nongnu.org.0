I dont think I was talking about tunneling at all, just QEMU
migration protocol options !

If an app is tunnelling QEMU's migration protocol over some
channel, that isn't important to QEMU - regardless whether a
passed in 'fd:' protocol FD is a direct TCP socket, or a
UNIX socket for a tunnel, QEMU works the same way. In one
of my other replies I mention a way to make 'fd:' work with
an arbitrary number of channels, by using an event from QEMU
to request the app provide additional FDs.


With regards,
Daniel
