Lets, say some commands normally runs in ~100ms, but occasionally
runs in 2secs, and you want to understand why.

A first step is understanding whether a given command itself is
slow at executing, or whether its execution has merely been
delayed because some other aspect of QEMU has delayed its execution.
If the server timestamps show it was very fast, then that indicates
delayed processing. Thus instead of debugging the slow command, I
can think about what scenarios would be responsible for the delay.
Perhaps a previous QMP command was very slow, or maybe there is
simply a large volume of QMP commands backlogged, or some part of
QEMU got blocked.

Another case would be a command that is normally fast, and sometimes
is slower, but still relatively fast. The network and queueing side
might be a significant enough proportion of the total time to obscure
the slowdown. If you can eliminate the non-execution time, you can
see the performance trends over time to spot the subtle slowdowns
and detect abnormal behaviour before it becomes too terrible.

With regards,
Daniel
