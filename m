Title:
  Qemu-img convert appears to be stuck on aarch64 host with low
  probability

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Hi,  I found a problem that qemu-img convert appears to be stuck on
  aarch64 host with low probability.

  The convert command  line is  "qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw
  disk.qcow2 disk.raw ".

  The bt is below:

  The problem seems to be very similar to the phenomenon described by
  this patch (https://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-4.1/src/qemu-kvm-
  ev/0025-aio_notify-force-main-loop-wakeup-with-SIGIO-aarch64.patch),

  which force main loop wakeup with SIGIO.  But this patch was reverted
  by the patch (http://ovirt.repo.nfrance.com/src/qemu-kvm-ev/kvm-
  Revert-aio_notify-force-main-loop-wakeup-with-SIGIO-.patch).

  I can reproduce this problem with qemu.git/matser. It still exists in qem=
u.git/matser. I found that when an IO return in
  worker threads and want to call aio_notify to wake up main_loop, but it f=
ound that ctx->notify_me is cleared to 0 by main_loop in aio_ctx_check by c=
alling atomic_and(&ctx->notify_me, ~1) . So worker thread won't write enven=
tfd to notify main_loop. If such a scene happens, the main_loop will hang:
      main loop                        worker thread1                      =
   worker thread2
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----------------       =

       qemu_poll_ns                     aio_worker        =

                                      qemu_bh_schedule(pool->completion_bh)=
                              =

      glib_pollfds_poll
      g_main_context_check
      aio_ctx_check                                                        =
 aio_worker                                                                =
                                    =

      atomic_and(&ctx->notify_me, ~1)                 qemu_bh_schedule(pool=
->completion_bh)                          =

                                                                           =
      =

      /* do something for event */   =

      qemu_poll_ns
      /* hangs !!!*/

  As we known ,ctx->notify_me will be visited by worker thread and main
  loop. I thank we should add a lock protection for ctx->notify_me to
  avoid this happend.
