(not so short introduction)

plug callbacks were designed for wiring up hotplugged device, hence
it has check for acpi_dev which is one of HW connections needed to make
it work. Later on coldplug was consolidated with it, so plug callbacks
are also handling coldplugged devices.

then later plug callback was split on pre_ and plug_, where pre_
part is called right before device_foo.realize() and plug_ right after.
Split was intended to make graceful failure easier, where pre_ is taking
care of checking already set properties and optionally setting additional
properties and can/should fail without side-effects, and plug_ part
should not fail (maybe there is still cleanup to do there) and used to
finish wiring after the device had been realized.

extra check is not must have in pc_memory_pre_plug() as it should not break anything
(modulo MMIO memhp interface, which went unnoticed since probably nobody
uses MMIO memhp registers directly (i.e. QEMU's ACPI tables is sole user))

pretty harmless in the same sense as in pc_memory_pre_plug(),
but I'd rather avoid checks that are not must have.

can't do it as it will break CPU clodplug when -no-cpi is used

We have pcms->acpi_dev check in x86 code because isapc/piix4 machines
will/might not create the pm device (which implements acpi hw). 

(1) if (pcmc->pci_enabled && x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled(X86_MACHINE(pcms)))

if that weren't the case, calls to acpi_dev would be unconditional

I'm adding check into pre_plug so we can gracefully reject device_add
in case firmware is not prepared for handling hotplug SMI. Since
the later might crash the guest. It's for the sake of better user
experience since QEMU might easily run older firmware.

If we don't care about that, we can drop negotiation and the check,
send SMI on hotplug when SMI broadcast is enabled, that might
crash guest since it might be not supported by used fw, but that
was already the case for quite a while and I've heard only few
complaints. (I guess most users have sense not to use something
not impl./supported)

I'd rather leave hw part decoupled from acpi tables part,
nothing prevents users implementing their own fw/os which uses
our cpuhp interface directly without ACPI.

x86_machine_is_acpi_enabled() is not must have in this case as
callbacks implement only hw part of cpuhp protocol (QEMU part),
what guest uses to handle it (fw tables(qemu generated),
or some custom code) is another story.
