Can you post a stack trace?

Signal 6 is not a segfault, but SIGABRT.

If s->co_revc != NULL before this, there is still a coroutine running
that hasn't terminated yet. Don't we need to make sure that the
coroutine actually terminates instead of just overwriting the pointer to
it?

Otherwise, we either leak the coroutine and the memory used for its
stack, or the coroutine continues to run at some point and might
interfer with the operation of the new instance.

This existing code after your change is wrong, too, by the way. It
potentially calls aio_co_wake() multiple times in a row, which will
crash if it ends up only scheduling the coroutine instead of directly
entering it.
