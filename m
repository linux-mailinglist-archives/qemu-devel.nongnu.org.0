I haven't understood why my suggested mult-device use case imposes a misusage, 
but okay, unless I hear different opinions, I'll prepare a v2 with that (IMO 
hackish) CL fiddling instead in couple days or so.

@Greg: If that's the way to go, then I probably change the test names, e.g.

	"fs/version/basic" -> "synth/version/basic"
	...
	"fs/create_dir" -> "local/create_dir"

to be able to easily distinguish 'synth' driver tests from 'local' driver 
tests, as they would then popup with the same device name in v2, unlike in 
this v1 where they have separate device names.

Yes, "-fsdev ..." and "-device ..." sequence could theoretically be flipped, 
qemu would accept it that is.

Sounds like that would require huge changes for all existing qtests on initial 
thought at least.

I find the suggested multi-device approach much simpler, as it does not 
require changes to existing tests, nor people having to get used to a new 
qtest model.
