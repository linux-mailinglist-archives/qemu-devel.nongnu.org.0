Yeh that's probably true, although there's a check for 'buffer_is_zero'
in the !rdma->pin_all case, if the entire area is zero (or probably if
unmapped) then it sends a notification rather than registering; see
qemu_rdma_write_one and search for 'This chunk has not yet been
registered, so first check to see'
