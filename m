Thing is that asymmetrical configurations is an easy concept to enforce
to the user - distance from A to B can't be different from B to A.

In the example you gave above, with 3 NUMA nodes, is easy to spot where
the non-transitivity rule would hit. I'm afraid that if we add 2-3 more
NUMA nodes in the mix this will stop being straightforward, with more and
more combinations hitting the 'non-transitivity' rule, and erroring out
will end up being frustrating to the user.

I'd say that we should report this in the documentation as one more
limitation of the implementation (and PAPR). I wouldn't oppose with
throwing a warning message either, letting the user know that the
approximation will be less precise than it already would be in this case.


Thanks,


DHB
