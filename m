There aren't many options here

 1. Rely on a vendor to provide stable download URLs for images

 2. QEMU host all images we use in testing

 3. Contributor finds some site to upload images to


For the armbian images we rely on (1), but the URLs didn't turn out to be
stable. In fact no OS vendor seems to have guaranteed stable URLs forever,
regardless of distro, though most eventually do have an archive site that
has good life. Armbian was an exception in this respect IIUC.

(2) would solve the long term stability problem as QEMU would be in full
control, and could open it up for any images we need. The big challenge
there is that QEMU now owns the license compliance problem. Merely uploading
binary images/packages without the corresponding source is generally a license
violation. QEMU could provide hosting, but we need to be clear about the fact
that we now own the license compliance problem ourselves. Many sites hosting
images simply ignore this problem, but that doesn't make it right.


This series is proposing (3), with a site the contributor happens to control
themselves, but using a free 3rd party hosting site is no different really.
Again there is a the same need for license compliance, but it is now the
responsibility of the user, not QEMU project.

In this http://www.freenos.org/pub/qemu/cubieboard/ site I can't even see a
directory listing, so even if corresponding source does exist in this server,
I can't find it. 

The isn't really a problem for QEMU CI to consume the images, but as a free
software developer I don't like encouraging practices that are not compliant
with licensing reuqirement.

It is an open question whether the (3) is really better than (1) in terms
of URL stability long term, especially if running off a user's personal
server.

Regards,
Daniel
