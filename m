Ack, I'm not familiar with the QMP side of things.

Probably not.  I was aiming to simplify things, but if my suggestions
don't make anything simpler, then it's obviously not worth it :)

I hadn't realised the sve-max-vq option was already merged.  I agree
that if there are established semantics for this, we shouldn't mess with
it now.

So, keep it as you proposed, I guess.
