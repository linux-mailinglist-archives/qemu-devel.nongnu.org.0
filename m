that's an interesting observation. Thank you for finding this one. It'd
be much faster to find one of about 10 debian patches which affects this
but full qemu bisect works too, ofcourse.

Simon, I can't reach you by email, your mailserver apparently
malfunctioning, - I sent you instructions about how and what to do, but
all my emails returned back - connections to your mailserver times out
from a few of networks I have access to.

This commit breaking macos guest is interesting, perhaps we should try
to fix that for 5.1.. :)

Title:
  Qemu after v5.0.0 breaks macos guests

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The Debian Sid 5.0-6 qemu-kvm package can no longer get further than
  the Clover bootloader whereas 5.0-6 and earlier worked fine.

  So I built qemu master from github and it has the same problem,
  whereas git tag v5.0.0 (or 4.2.1) does not, so something between
  v5.0.0 release and the last few days has caused the problem.

  Here's my qemu script, pretty standard macOS-Simple-KVM setup on a
  Xeon host:

  qemu-system-x86_64 \
      -enable-kvm \
      -m 4G \
      -machine q35,accel=3Dkvm \
      -smp 4,sockets=3D1,cores=3D2,threads=3D2 \
      -cpu =

  Penryn,vendor=3DGenuineIntel,kvm=3Don,+sse3,+sse4.2,+aes,+xsave,+avx,+xsa=
veopt,+xsavec,+xgetbv1,+avx2,+bmi2,+smep,+bmi1,+fma,+movbe,+invtsc =

  \
      -device =

  isa-applesmc,osk=3D"ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)Apple=
ComputerInc" =

  \
      -smbios type=3D2 \
      -drive if=3Dpflash,format=3Draw,readonly,file=3D"/tmp/OVMF_CODE.fd" \
      -drive if=3Dpflash,format=3Draw,file=3D"/tmp/macos_catalina_VARS.fd" \
      -vga qxl \
      -device ich9-ahci,id=3Dsata \
      -drive id=3DESP,if=3Dnone,format=3Draw,file=3D/tmp/ESP.img \
      -device ide-hd,bus=3Dsata.2,drive=3DESP \
      -drive id=3DInstallMedia,format=3Draw,if=3Dnone,file=3D/tmp/BaseSyste=
m.img \
      -device ide-hd,bus=3Dsata.3,drive=3DInstallMedia \
      -drive id=3DSystemDisk,if=3Dnone,format=3Draw,file=3D/tmp/macos_catal=
ina.img \
      -device ide-hd,bus=3Dsata.4,drive=3DSystemDisk \
      -usb -device usb-kbd -device usb-mouse

  Perhaps something has changed in Penryn support recently, as that's
  required for macos?

  Also on a related note, kernel 5.6/5.7 (on Debian) hard crashes the
  host when I try GPU passthrough on macos, whereas Ubuntu20/Win10 work
  fine - as does 5.5 kernel.
