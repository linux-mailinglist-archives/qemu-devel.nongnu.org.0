v3's commit message:

    qapi: Allow introspecting fix for savevm's cooperation with blockdev
    
    'savevm' was buggy as it considered all monitor-owned block device nodes
    for snapshot. With introduction of -blockdev the common usage made all
    nodes including protocol and backing file nodes monitor-owned and thus
    considered for snapshot.
    
    This is a problem since the 'file' protocol nodes can't have internal
    snapshots and it does not make sense to take snapshot of nodes
    representing backing files.
    
    This was fixed by commit 05f4aced658a02b02 clients need to be able to
    detect whether this fix is present.
    
    Since savevm does not have an QMP alternative, add the feature for the
    'human-monitor-command' backdoor which is used to call this command in
    modern use.

Kevin, is this explanation sufficiently correct & complete?
