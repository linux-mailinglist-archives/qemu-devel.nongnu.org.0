Mostly, I just haven't had time.  I'm also finding the patches pretty
difficult to read and review.  I don't think that's an indication
they're bad, just that what they're doing is necessarily complex, but
it's still made it hard to tackle them.

You, might as well repost, so I'm looking at the latest stuff.  I
can't promise I'll be able to look at the new set terribly soon
though.
