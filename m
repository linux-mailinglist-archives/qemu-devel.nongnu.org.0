I agree we're basically in agreement :)

Covering dynamically defined external interfaces (such as device_add and
object-add) in query-qmp-schema would certainly be nice, but it's not a
hard requirement.  If we can't, then having separate introspection
commands share abstractions as much as practical is desirable.

Command line means stderr.

I'm afraid our command line is awkward both for machines and for humans,
albeit for different reasons.

For humans doing simple things, the command line is okay.  But beyond
that, it gets forbiddingly unwieldy[2].

Machines are fine with that kind of unwieldy, but would prefer something
with more structure, both on input (talking to QEMU) and even more so on
output (QEMU talking back).

Ideally, we'd support machines do their work in (structured) QMP,
resorting to the command line only to set up a QMP monitor.  We're not
anywhere close to this.

As long as management applications use the command line in not-trivial
ways, they have to deal with configuration errors reported via stderr.

A management application simply showing its user whatever error QEMU
reports or hint it provides is bound to be confusing: since QEMU talks
in QEMU terms, its errors and hints generally need translation to make
sense at higher layers.  Translation involves recognizing specific
messages, which means it's limited to special cases (and painfully
brittle).

The farther you propagate QEMU's messages up the stack, the less sense
they'll likely make.

Management applications logging QEMU's messages is useful anyway, mainly
because it's better than nothing.

I doubt logging them some more further up the stack would be all that
useful, but I might be wrong.

Discussed further elsewhere in this thread.

Let me try differently.

QAPI features as currently envisaged convey one bit of information:
there / not there.  The information is fixed at build time.  It is tied
to a specific QAPI entity (command, object type, enumeration value,
...).

My question is about the difference between this and what you have in
mind.  Specifically, is the difference only the amount of information
(one bit vs. a pair of string literals), or is there more?

"More" includes string values that can vary at run time or between
different uses of the QAPI entity in the schema.

Insufficiently precise thinking leads to vague and confusing prose.  Let
me try again.

The scenario I had in mind is having only the (static) structure of the
additional information in query-qmp-schema, and the actual (possibly
dynamic) information elsewhere, say in query-machines, or a new member
of the QMP success response.

I wouldn't claim "better".  I merely observe it takes its own QAPI
language extension, unlike the 'neat and simple "use QAPI features to
communicate deprecation" idea'.
