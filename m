Correct. It seems to me that having it there in PCIIDEState provides a convenient
place for all controllers that support legacy mode to store the IRQ in case someone
would like to add legacy support to the device at a later date.

If you really object to this then as I mentioned above, you'll need to add a
VIAIDEState or similar and have the legacy IRQs there for the qdev gpio connector.

I certainly agree with your analysis here, and that is borne out by the fact that you
are able to boot your OSs using your current hack with no PCI interrupts.

This isn't complexity though, it is just normal qdev usage. In fact if you look at
isa_get_irq() it contains this large comment above the function itself:

/*
 * isa_get_irq() returns the corresponding qemu_irq entry for the i8259.
 *
 * This function is only for special cases such as the 'ferr', and
 * temporary use for normal devices until they are converted to qdev.
 */

It was a temporary hack to allow old devices to access the 8259 IRQs before devices
were converted to qdev. And via-ide is a qdev device, so that's how you need to wire
it up.

Like I said above: if you really don't want to put the legacy IRQs there then you
need to create a VIAIDEState for the qdev gpio connector.

That's not what I'm suggesting though.

This may be a separate issue. As you mentioned in your email most guest OSs on
Pegasos blindly ignore the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE register since they know that the IRQs
are hardwired. However you may also be getting caught out by the bug that the current
implementation will try and use the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE IRQ for routing which is
incorrect.

Both the 8231 and 636B datasheets mark PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE as read-only with a default
value of 0xe, so I believe that once you've done the qdev gpio part, keeping this
part of your patchset as a separate patch should fix this.

I don't know what else to say except other than what I have already said: both the
current via-ide IRQ implementation and the changes in your patchset are incorrect.

I've given you the outline of what you need to do to switch the device over to qdev
which agrees with the datasheet, the PCI specification, comments within the QEMU code
itself and the results of your experiments. The proposed change is also simple to
implement (less than an hour's work) using standard APIs.

At this time I don't see any point in continuing to repeat myself over and over
again: if you can make the qdev change and post an updated patchset then I'm happy to
review and continue this discussion, but otherwise I don't see any purpose in
continuing this thread.


ATB,

Mark.
