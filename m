More reading on the spec, I found a statement as below=20
(https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/ACPI_6_3_May16.pdf,=20
section 6.1, on top of page 343):

A device object must contain either an _HID object or an _ADR object,=20
but should not contain both

So I think it is at least not recomended to use both _HID and _ADR in a=20
single device object.

Thanks,

Heyi
