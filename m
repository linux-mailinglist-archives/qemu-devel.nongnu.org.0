Yes, minor changes in hardware or firmware that may not be represented
in the device ID or hardware revision.  Also the version is as much for
indicating the compatibility of the vendor defined migration protocol
as it is for the hardware itself.  I certainly wouldn't be so bold as
to create a protocol that is guaranteed compatible forever.  We'll need
to expose the same sysfs attribute in some standard location for
non-mdev devices.  I assume vfio-pci would provide the vendor ops some
mechanism to expose these in a standard namespace of sysfs attributes
under the device itself.  Perhaps that indicates we need to link the
mdev type version under the mdev device as well to make this
transparent to userspace tools like libvirt.  Thanks,

Alex
