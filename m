Hrm, that helps, but it still seems pretty vague to me.

It's not really my call, but building the concept of warm versus cold
resets into such a generic interface seems pretty dubios to me.  While
it's moderately common for things to have a notion of warm versus cold
reset it's certainly not universal.  There are many devices where
there's no meaningful difference between the two.  There are some
devices where there are > 2 different types of reset suitable for
various different situations.

Is there any way this could work with it usually just presenting the
cold reset (which is the closest to a universal concept), and any warm
or additional resets are handled buy a different instance of the
Resettable interface?
