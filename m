Dave ran the above testcase on:

> processor	: 0
> cpu		: POWER8E (raw), altivec supported
> clock		: 3325.000000MHz
> revision	: 2.1 (pvr 004b 0201)

And there are no diffs with what you currently get from master. So I
think the invalid flag fault is fixed by a previous commit and the
potential precision faults don't get picked up by the test case. I guess
we could be a bit smarted about testing the limits.

Title:
  ppc: softfloat float implementation issues

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Per bug #1841491, Richard Henderson (rth) said:
  > The float test failure is part of a larger problem for target/powerpc
  > in which all float routines are implemented incorrectly. They are all
  > implemented as double operations with rounding to float as a second
  > step. Which not only produces incorrect exceptions, as in this case,
  > but incorrect numerical results from the double rounding.
  >
  > This should probably be split to a separate bug...
