As privileged specification says,

"Whenever XLEN in any mode is set to a value less than the widest supported XLEN, all operations
must ignore source operand register bits above the configured XLEN, and must sign-extend results
to fill the entire widest supported XLEN in the destination register. Similarly, pc bits above XLEN
are ignored, and when the pc is written, it is sign-extended to fill the widest supported XLEN."

If we want to strictly obey the spec, we should
1) Ignore MSB 32bits for source register, and sign-extend the 
destination register.
2) Always use 32bit operation(TCG 32bit OP).

I want to still use TCG 64bit OP and just extend the source to 64bit by 
ext32s or ext32u.

Is is OK?

Thanks,
Zhiwei

      In general I would think that the destination register need not be
      extended for 32-bit mode, unless the architecture says otherwise. 
      (What does the architecture say about the contents of the
      registers when transitioning from a 32-bit mode user program to a
      64-bit mode kernel?)
