Yes, unfortunately I don=E2=80=99t seem to have a way to look for that end.=

Well, my problem is about the source side, where there is still a VM
running that I would expect to be in a sane state even after a failed
migration.

What exactly do you mean?  It appears to me that both query-status and
the MIGRATION events signal the failed state before migrate_fd_cleanup()
is invoked.

If you mean I could add a notifier to that list to do something=E2=84=A2, I=
=E2=80=99m
not sure what exactly it is I=E2=80=99d so.  My test can=E2=80=99t do it, b=
ecause it=E2=80=99s
an iotest, and even if it could, I suppose I=E2=80=99d want to wait until e=
ven
after all notifiers have been invoked (which isn=E2=80=99t guaranteed if I=
=E2=80=99d add
a notifier myself).

So you mean waiting until migrate_fd_cleanup() has run?  Maybe I=E2=80=99ll=
 try
that tomorrow, although I=E2=80=99d hoped I could get this done without hav=

to modify the code base...  (I.e., I=E2=80=99d hoped there would be some

migrate_fd_cleanup() has run)

:(

OK then.  Thanks for your insights!
