AFAIU, currently not: they don't have vIOMMU support at all.

I don't know if this is useful or not but Hyper-V TLFS has the following
bits defined:

CPUID 0x40000004.EAX:

Bit 6: Recommend using DMA remapping.
Bit 7: Recommend using interrupt remapping.
Bit 8: Recommend using x2APIC MSRs.

AFAIR we don't set these bits in KVM/QEMU with the currently implemented
Hyper-V enlightenments. I'd suggest to hack things up and set these to
see what happens :-) My guess is that it may even work, looking at linux
commit 29217a474683 it doesn't seem that we heed a new hypercall or
anything specific.
