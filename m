I don't really understand why we want to do this complicated
thing, rather than just doing the normal thing for devices
that live at particular addresses, ie make them sysbus devices
and have the board map their memory regions in the right place.

I don't think we want to do this. The user should not have to
know anything about addresses or have to specify them on the
command line. (This is why you can't create sysbus devices
with -device except for some odd special cases to do with passthrough
of hardware.)

Not sure entirely what you have in mind here? (though yes, the
sysbus device API has its awkward corners, some of which are
just down to how old it is.)
