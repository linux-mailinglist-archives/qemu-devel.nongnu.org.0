 Hi Kashyap,

first thanks for writing up this article! It's a really nice summary of
the presentation, I think.

But before we include it, let me ask a meta-question: Is an article
about the KVM *kernel* code suitable for the *QEMU* blog? Or is there
maybe a better place for this, like an article on www.linux-kvm.org ?

Opinions? Ideas?

 Thomas
