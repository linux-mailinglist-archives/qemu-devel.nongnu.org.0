I think the pattern exists, but we deviate from it in quite a few
places, probably just because it's so much boilerplate.

Related: Daniel's "[PATCH 0/4] qom: reduce boilerplate required for
declaring and defining objects".  Perhaps Daniel has an opinion on
taking shortcuts with leaf types.

Rule of thumb: hw/ide/ is a bad example.  I don't mean to belittle the
efforts of quite a few people over the years.  It used to be worse.

I'm fine with having a separate convention for leaf types if that helps,
but please let's have a convention.  I like my QOM boilerplate
uncreative.
