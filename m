No, because =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m afraid=E2=80=9D is a sentiment I fully sha=

answer the question whether we are indeed overengineering this or not. :-)

I suppose my stance now is =E2=80=9CThis is probably overengineered, but no=

I=E2=80=99d rather not get into a deeper discussion on what CONSISTENT_READ
means again... :-/

I always feel like if you really take only a single point in time, then
anything could be some hypothetical disk.

So to me, unsharing CONSISTENT_READ effectively just means =E2=80=9CDon=E2=
=80=99t touch
this, you don=E2=80=99t want to=E2=80=9D.

Only in theory, though, because in practice basically everything useful
takes CONSISTENT_READ anyway.

OK, I=E2=80=99ll check the parent list then.  (Except it must be exactly on=
e
parent, namely Quorum.)
