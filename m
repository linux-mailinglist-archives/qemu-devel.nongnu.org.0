 A ``log_global_start`` and ``log_global_stop`` memory listener callback informs
-the VFIO IOMMU module to start and stop dirty page tracking. A ``log_sync``
-memory listener callback marks those system memory pages as dirty which are
-used for DMA by the VFIO device. The dirty pages bitmap is queried per
-container. All pages pinned by the vendor driver through external APIs have to
-be marked as dirty during migration. When there are CPU writes, CPU dirty page

+``log_sync`` memory listener callback queries the dirty page bitmap from the
+dirty tracking module and marks system memory pages which were DMA-ed by the
+VFIO device as dirty. The dirty page bitmap is queried per container.
+
+Currently there are two ways dirty page tracking can be done:
+(1) Device dirty tracking:
+In this method the device is responsible to log and report its DMAs. This
+method can be used only if the device is capable of tracking its DMAs.
+Discovering device capability, starting and stopping dirty tracking, and
+syncing the dirty bitmaps from the device are done using the DMA logging uAPI.
+More info about the uAPI can be found in the comments of the
+``vfio_device_feature_dma_logging_control`` and
+``vfio_device_feature_dma_logging_report`` structures in the header file
+linux-headers/linux/vfio.h.
+
+(2) VFIO IOMMU module:
+In this method dirty tracking is done by IOMMU. However, there is currently no
+IOMMU support for dirty page tracking. For this reason, all pages are
+perpetually marked dirty, unless the device driver pins pages through external
+APIs in which case only those pinned pages are perpetually marked dirty.
+
+If the above two methods are not supported, all pages are perpetually marked
+dirty by QEMU.
 
 By default, dirty pages are tracked during pre-copy as well as stop-and-copy
