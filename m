There's also SUNW,tcx I can think of immediately, plus there's a few others mentioned 
in hw/sparc/sun4m.c. The reason these names have commas is simply because that's the 
name of the corresponding node in the PROM device tree.

A quick grep suggests that all these devices are in-built: the selection between 
SUNW,tcx and cg3 framebuffers is decided with the -vga command line option, so 
potentially these could be renamed without any user-visible changes.


ATB,

Mark.
