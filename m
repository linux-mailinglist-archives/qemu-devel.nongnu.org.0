How about having --enable-pypi never|auto|force with the following
semantics for --enable-docs + --enable-pypi


  * docs=no   - pypi never used

  * docs=auto + pypi=never  => docs only enable if sphinx is already
                               installed locally, otherwise disabled

  * docs=auto + pypi=auto  => docs enable if sphinx is already
                              installed locally, or can download from
			      pypi as fallback

  * docs=auto + pypi=force  => always download sphinx from pypi


  * docs=yes + pypi=never  => ERROR if sphinx is not already
                              installed locally

  * docs=yes + pypi=auto  => docs enable if sphinx is already
                             installed locally, or can download from
			     pypi as fallback

  * docs=yes + pypi=force  => always download sphinx from pypi



So eg distros could use pypi=never, devs would use pypi=auto mostly,
while CI might use pypi=force to test specific versions indepenant
of distros ?
