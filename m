Advanced Watch Dog is an universal monitoring module on VMM side, it can be used
to detect network down(VMM to guest, VMM to VMM, VMM to another remote server)
and do previously set operation. Current AWD patch just accept any input as the
signal to refresh the watchdog timer, and we can also make a certain interactive
protocol here. For the outputs, user can pre-write some command or some messages
in the AWD opt-script. We noticed that there is no way for VMM communicate
directly, maybe some people think we don't need such things(up layer
software like openstack can handle it). so we engaged with real customer found
that they need a lightweight and efficient mechanism to solve some practical problems,

For example Edge Computing cases(they think high level software is too heavy
to use in Edge or it is hard to manage and combine with VM instance).
It make user have basic VM/Host network monitoring tools and basic false
tolerance and recovery solution..

Please see the detail documentation in the last patch.

V4:
 - Add more introduction in qemu-options.hx
 - Addressed Paolo's comments add docs/awd.txt for the AWD module detail.

V3:
 - Rebased on Qemu 4.2.0-rc1 code.
 - Fix commit message issue.

V2:
 - Addressed Philippe comments add configure selector for AWD.

Initial:
 - Initial version.
