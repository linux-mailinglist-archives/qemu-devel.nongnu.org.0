Uhh... good point, I don't think that could break it.  Even if we
deprecated a capability we could still retain enough awareness of the
old number to sanity check this.

No, they don't but that's actually the problem.  The point is that we
might backport some later caps without necessarily backporting all the
earlier ones - that means that the "max cap index" no longer implies
that all the lower indexed caps are present.

Yes... I don't really see where you're goig with that thought.

Yeah, maybe.  I think we have a hack like this for one of the other
caps already.
