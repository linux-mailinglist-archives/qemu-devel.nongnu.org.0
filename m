Only if you copy the bitmaps, though, which requires using the --bitmaps
switch for convert.

It was my impression that existing users won=E2=80=99t have to do that, bec=
ause
they don=E2=80=99t use --bitmaps yet.

In contrast, if we included the bitmap size in @required or
@fully-allocated, then previous users that didn=E2=80=99t copy bitmaps to t=
he
destination (which they couldn=E2=80=99t) would allocate too much space.

...revisiting this after reading more of your mail: With a --bitmaps
switch, existing users wouldn=E2=80=99t suffer from such compatibility prob=
lems.
 However, then users (that now want to copy bitmaps) will have to pass
the new --bitmaps flag in the command line, and I don=E2=80=99t see how tha=
t=E2=80=99s
less complicated than just adding @bitmaps to @required.

Well, but you=E2=80=99ll also see that convert --bitmaps will fail.  But I =
can
see that you probably want to know about that before you create the
target image.

And otherwise?  Do you error out, or do you just omit --bitmaps from
convert?

Well, it would be consistent with the convert interface.  If you specify
it for one, you specify it for the other.

OTOH, this would mean having to pass around the @bitmaps bool in the
block layer, which is a bit more difficult than just adding a new field
in BlockMeasureInfo.  It would also mean to add a new bool every time we
add a new extension (which you hinted at above that it might happen).

(We could also let img_measure() in qemu-img add @bitmaps to @required
if --bitmaps was given, so we wouldn=E2=80=99t have to pass the bool around=
; but
I think letting qemu-img fix up a QAPI object filled by the block driver
sounds wrong.  (Because that means the block driver didn=E2=80=99t fill it
correctly.))

And I don=E2=80=99t see how the interface proposed here by Eric (or rather,=
 what
I think we had agreed on for the next version) poses any problems for
users.  If you want to copy bitmaps, you just use @required + @bitmaps.
 (If @bitmaps isn=E2=80=99t present, you can=E2=80=99t copy bitmaps, so tha=
t should be
an error.)  If you don=E2=80=99t want to copy bitmaps, you just use @requir=
ed.

(And if you want to copy bitmaps if present, you use @required +
@bitmaps, and treat @bitmaps as 0 if not present.)

I personally don=E2=80=99t really consider that a significant advantage... =
 (On
the contrary, seeing the field in all old tests means the code path is
exercised more often, even though it=E2=80=99s supposed to always just repo=
rt 0.)

So all in all the main benefit I see in your proposal, i.e. having
@bitmaps be included in @required with --bitmaps given, is that it would
give a symmetrical interface between measure and convert: For simple
cases, you can just replace the =E2=80=9Cconvert=E2=80=9D in your command l=
ine by
=E2=80=9Cmeasure=E2=80=9D, retrieve @required/@fully-allocated, create the =
target image
based on that, and then re-run the same command line, but with =E2=80=9Ccon=
vert=E2=80=9D
this time.

But I=E2=80=99m not sure whether that=E2=80=99s really an advantage in prac=
tice or more
of a gimmick.  With Eric=E2=80=99s proposal, if you want to convert with
bitmaps, just add @bitmaps to the target size.  If you don=E2=80=99t, don=
=E2=80=99t.  If
you=E2=80=99d prefer to but don=E2=80=99t really care, add =E2=80=9C@bitmap=
s ?: 0=E2=80=9D.

The benefit of Eric=E2=80=99s proposal (not including @bitmaps in @required=
 or
@fully-allocated) is that it doesn=E2=80=99t require passing an additional
parameter to the block driver.  It also makes the definition of
BlockMeasureInfo simpler.  With your proposal, it would need to be
parameterized.  (As in, @required sometimes includes the bitmaps,
sometimes it doesn=E2=80=99t, depending on the parameter used to retrieve
BlockMeasureInfo.)  I=E2=80=99m not sure whether that even makes sense in t=
he
QAPI definition.
