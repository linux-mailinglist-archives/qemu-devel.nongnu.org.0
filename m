Yes, but your change here makes it call kvm_arm_vgic_probe()
even if the gic_version was explicitly set to 2 or 3
by the user, doesn't it ? That's what I was commenting on.

I think:
(1) we should retain the current behaviour that if the user
asked for userspace-irqchip and specifically chose gic
version 2, then we don't probe the kernel for its capabilities,
we just create a userspace gicv2.

(2) we should also retain the current behaviour that we
default to "2" if the user requests userspace-irqchip but
doesn't specify the gic-version.

(3) the ideal-world behaviour would be that we correctly
handle the user asking for userspace-irqchip plus either "max"
(choose '2') or "3" (produce a useful error message if we
don't do so already). I'm not sure what "host" should mean
here. But this point (3) is separate from what this series is
doing, I think, and is basically fixing the bug that we didn't
think about the userspace-irqchip case when we implemented
"host" and "max" or when we added GICv3 support.
