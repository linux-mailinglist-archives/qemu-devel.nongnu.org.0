Title:
  Unable to boot Solaris 8/9 x86 under Fedora 24

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -version
  QEMU emulator version 2.6.2 (qemu-2.6.2-4.fc24), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 =
Fabrice Bellard

  Try several ways without success, I think it was a regression because pro=
blem seems to be related with ide fixed on 0.6.0:
  - int13 CDROM BIOS fix (aka Solaris x86 install CD fix)
  - int15, ah=3D86 BIOS fix (aka Solaris x86 hardware probe hang up fix)

  Solaris 10/11 works without a problem, also booting with "scsi" will
  circumvent initial problem, but later found problems related with
  "scsi" cdrom boot and also will not found the "ide" disk device.
