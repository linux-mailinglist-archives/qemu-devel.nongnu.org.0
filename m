I'll look up that discussion.

Patch 6 adds "This function is thread-safe" to its contract.  The
restrictions on OOB-capable handler code are much more severe than
ordinary thread safety.  For instance, blocking system calls outside
critical sections are thread safe, but not permitted in OOB-capable
handler code.  The contract needs to be more specific.
