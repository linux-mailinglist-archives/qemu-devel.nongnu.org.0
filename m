IIRC, the connect() can succeed on the source host, even if the target ho=
st
has not called accept(), because the kernel will complete the connection =
at
the protocol level regardless. IOW, don't assume that the destination QEM=
U
has seen the connection. If you turn on tracing, we have a trace point
"qio_channel_socket_accept_complete" that is emitted after we have done
an accept(). So you can see if you get 100 of those trace points emitted
on the target, when you make 100 connects on the source.

Daniel
