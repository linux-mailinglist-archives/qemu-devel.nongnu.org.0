Ok, take two:

=3D=3D=3D RISC-V Foundation Extensions =3D=3D=3D
As RISC-V has a range of possible extensions, QEMU has guidelines for
supporting them all.

If an extension is frozen or ratified by the RISC-V foundation, it can
be supported in QEMU. Generally we will try to support as many versions
as feasible, following the usual QEMU deprecation policy to remove old
versions.

If an official RISC-V foundation extension is in a reasonable draft
state, that is not too many changes are still expected, it can be
supported experimentally by QEMU. Experimental support means it must
be disabled by default and marked with a "x-" in the CPU/board properties.
Draft extensions can be enabled by specific CPUs or boards if the hardware
supports that extension.

QEMU will only support the latest version of patches submitted for a draft
extension. A draft extension can also be removed at any time and does not
follow QEMU's deprecation policy.

=3D=3D=3D RISC-V Custom Extensions/Instructions =3D=3D=3D
Support for custom instruction set extensions are an important part of RISC=
-V,
with large encoding spaces reserved of vendor extensions.

QEMU follows similar rules to the RISC-V toolchain convention, as described
here: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions/pull/17

QEMU will support vendor extensions. Vendor extensions must be
disabled by default, but can be enabled for specific vendor CPUs and
boards. The vendor extensions should use prefixes and names as described in
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions

Vendor extensions must be maintained and tested by the vendor. Upstream wil=
l
take efforts to not break extensions, but testing and bug fixes should be
done by the vendor. Patches to add support for open source toolchains are
unlikely to be accepted without specification documents being made availabl=
e
publicly.

Vendor extensions can not interfere with other extensions and can not
be obtrusive to the core RISC-V target code.

If you are looking to add support for vendor extensions, it is recommended
that you get involved in the QEMU review process. It is also recommended th=
at
you send your patches as early as possible to get community feedback before
they are fully implemented. This is especially important if you are modifyi=
ng
core code.
