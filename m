Fair enough, I was not intending to offend Stéphane, and I apologize for 
this.
I will revise this patch.

Sure. Run a Windows guest with two audio devices, let it boot up, then 
restart
the jack service to trigger the recovery routine, then attempt to use 
the 2nd
(non-primary) audio device. Ie, go to windows audio settings to test the
microphone of the second audio device.

When windows try to use the 2nd audio device it goes through the 
recovery
routine triggering this fault.

I am aware and since these libraries are interchangeable I had assumed 
that
JACK1 will have the same fault. If not I suppose we need to detect which 
is in
use and change this code appropriately.
