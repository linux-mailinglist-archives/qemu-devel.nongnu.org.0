The above mentioned whitepaper also discuss how VMware maintains the=20
wallclock time across migrations (vMotion).
See section "Using VMware Tools Clock Synchronization" in whitepaper.

Specifically, there is an option in .vmx file named=20
"time.synchronize.resume.disk" which:
"""
If set to TRUE, the clock syncs after resuming from suspend and after=20
migrating to a new host using the VMware VMotion feature.
"""

The matching functionality in open-vm-tools can can be seen in=20
services/plugins/timeSync/timeSync.c where ToolsOnLoad()
registers the "Time_Synchronize" RpcCallback, which is=20
TimeSyncTcloHandler(), that is possibly allowed to sync time backwards=20
(Note the "backwardSync" var).

The current patch-series I have submitted doesn't implement this=20
RpcCallback functionality.
That work can be delayed to a future patch-series that will add this=20
extra functionality as-well.

This is a very good point.
VMware also have the ability that allows user to explicitly set guest=20
time with .vmx "rtc.startTime" option.
(The time-zone can also be set by specifying an offset from UTC with=20
"rtc.diffFromUTC" option)

However, if you will read section "Using VMware Tools Clock=20
Synchronization -> Disabling All Synchronization" in above mentioned=20
whitepaper,
you will notice that in VMware's design, VMPort CMD_GETTIME command is=20
intentionally not synced with virtual CMOS TOD. i.e. The section explicit=
ly
documents that if a user wants to set guest time to fictitious time,=20
user must disable VMware Tools time sync functionality by manipulating
"tools.syncTime" and "time.synchronize.*" configuration options as desire=
d.

Therefore, I think current patch VMPort CMD_GETTIME command=20
implementation is correct.
What do you think?
