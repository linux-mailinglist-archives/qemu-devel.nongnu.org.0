I'm afraid there is no standard way to do it yet.
Even for virt targeted boards we have a mix of
  1. explicit mapping of memory region (arm/virt, x86, spapr),
     -m/-machine memory-backend CLI options
          (with optional partitioning of it internally, using aliases
          (pc/q35, some other embed boards))=20
     which now maps auto-created or user provided hostmem back-end
     memory region=20
     This area is quite a mess.
  2. device based RAM in guise of pc-dimm or nv-dimm, where user
     explicitly provides hostmem back-end and pairing it
     with [pc|nv]-dimm frontend on CLI (i.e. like on real hardware
     machines).

Theoretically you can reuse pc-dimm if whole dimm maps into VM address
space. It will get accounted in HMP info commands automatically. But
it hasn't been done for main RAM on any machine yet so thta's an area
to experiment with. which opens questions:
 * how to map -m/-machine memory-backend to frontend
 * or maybe ditch -m and force user to specify all DIMMs on CLI
   explicitly.
