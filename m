Kevin's "[PATCH v4 0/6] file-posix: Add dynamic-auto-read-only QAPI
feature" adds "feature flags" to the QAPI schema language, limited to
struct types, because that's what he needs.  They're visible in
introspection.  I intend to complete his work, so we can tack
"deprecated" feature flags to pretty much anything

Could that address your need?
