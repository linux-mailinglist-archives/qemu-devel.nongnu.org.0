Looking at our code we're still implementing the x87 insns FSIN, FCOS,
FSINCOS, FPTAN, FPATAN, F2XM1, FYL2X, FYL2XP1 by "convert the floatx80
to a host double and use the host C library functions", so I think this
bug is still unfixed. If the C program in comment 1 and/or the Python
code has stopped reporting failures it's probably just because the guest
C library routines have stopped using the x87 80-bit FPU instructions
internally.

  Confirmed

Bug description:
  When doing the regression tests for Python 3.1.2 with Qemu 0.12.5, (Linux=

  gcc (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2, Python compiled from sources within qemu,
  3 math tests fail, apparently because the floating point unit is buggy. Q=
