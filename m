These other includes are not useless: they are essential for generating
self-contained headers.

When MOD.json includes SUBMOD.json, then the generated qapi-FOO-MOD.h
include qapi-FOO-SUBMOD.h.  When every module pulls in the modules it
requires, so do the generated headers.  When a module doesn't, its
generated headers won't compile unless you manually include the missing
generated headers it requires.

Breaks our simple & stupid way to generate self-contained headers.

You're right, ordering by first include is not completely general.

"Background jobs" is job.json.

"Block devices" is block.json, which includes block-core.json, which
includes job.json.

To be able to put "Block devices" first, you'd have to break the chain
from block.json to job.json.  Which might even be an improvement:

$ wc -l qapi/*.json | awk '$1 >= 1000 { print }'
  5527 qapi/block-core.json
  1722 qapi/migration.json
  1617 qapi/misc.json
  1180 qapi/ui.json
 17407 total

Could we split block-core.json into several cohesive parts?

Fair enough.
