LGTM. Just found two typos, see below (I've added extra blank lines so
that you can spot them more easily).

> +After an event data has been enqueued in the O/S Event Queue, the IVPE
> +raises the bit corresponding to the priority of the pending interrupt
> +in the register IBP (Interrupt Pending Buffer) to indicate that an
> +event is pending in one of the 8 priority queues. The Pending
> +Interrupt Priority Register (PIPR) is also updated using the IPB. This
> +register represent the priority of the most favored pending
> +notification.

> +The PIPR is then compared to the the Current Processor Priority
> +Register (CPPR). If it is more favored (numerically less than), the
> +CPU interrupt line is raised and the EO bit of the Notification Source
> +Register (NSR) is updated to notify the presence of an exception for
> +the O/S. The O/S acknowledges the interrupt with a special load in the
> +Thread Interrupt Management Area.
