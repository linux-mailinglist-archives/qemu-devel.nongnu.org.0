I'm not seeing how checking the pid file is better than checking
the socket directly ? I think it is probably actually worse.

The main problem with the socket is that while we unlink on clean
shutdown, it may still exist in disk if the process has exitted
abnormally.

With the pidfile though we don't ever unlink it, even on clean
shutdown, as we don't use the pid files existance as a mutual
exclusion check. We instead acquire fcntl locks on it.

IOW the pidfile could exist already when qemu-nbd starts up and
will still exist when it quits.
