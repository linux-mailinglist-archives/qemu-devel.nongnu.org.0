Further, this vhost-user.rst spec document is explicitly describing
the contract between the vhost-user binaries and the management
layer. So it doesn't make sense to say update this doc to describe
desired semantics for usage /without/ a management layer.

So I agree, the default behaviour should be that there is one binary
spawned at time the associated device is initialization, and that
the lifetime of the binary is 1:1 associated with the lifetime of
the VM, or until the device is unplugged.=20
