Hey Thomas,

I didn't really have any specific questions. I wanted to know if there was
any part of qemu that I could contribute to. Qemu is overwhelmingly vast
and without some pointers, I felt very lost.

might be lots of devices which Qemu might want to emulate but which haven't

there was work related to python packaging as well, which I had commented
on in Launchpad. John told me quite a bit about that as well. I am
interested in that as well. I have already submitted a trivial patch for
handling compiler warnings and I am trying to get it accepted.
