mirror_top_bs is currently implicitly drained through its connection to
the source or the target node. However, the drain section for target_bs
ends early after moving mirror_top_bs from src to target_bs, so that
requests can already be restarted while mirror_top_bs is still present
in the chain, but has dropped all permissions and therefore runs into an
assertion failure like this:

    qemu-system-x86_64: block/io.c:1634: bdrv_co_write_req_prepare:
    Assertion `child->perm & BLK_PERM_WRITE' failed.

Keep mirror_top_bs drained until all graph changes have completed.
