I found my 'ready' patch, it is already merged as commit 00cbd5bd74b1 =3D)

    hw/arm/bcm2835: Add various unimplemented peripherals

    Base addresses and sizes taken from the "BCM2835 ARM Peripherals"
    datasheet from February 06 2012:
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals=
.pdf

I'm successfully running U-boot and Linux on raspi0/1/2/3 so I guess
it is safe to remove ignore_memory_transaction_failures for the
raspi2.
It might be insufficient to run proprietary firmware (on the raspi2),
I have no idea if people use QEMU for that.
