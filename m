Correct.

Corollary: you can't use to return value to check for failure, except
when you know the property cannot be zero (you commonly don't).

The function predates our (rather late) realization that returning a
recognizable error value in addition to setting an error leads to more
readable code.  Today, we'd perhaps do it the way you describe below.

Matter of taste.

There's no shortage of _undefined_ in C...

If you think the contract could be improved, please post a patch.

What assertion do you have in mind?  If it's adding assert(errp) to
object_property_get_uint(), I'll object.  Functions should not place
additional restrictions on @errp arguments without a compelling reason.

If almost all calls assign the value to a variable, like

    val = object_property_get_uint(obj, name, &err);
    if (err) {
        error_propagate(errp, err)
        ... bail out ...
    }
    ... use val ...

then the alternative Greg proposed is easier on the eyes:

    if (!object_property_get_uint(obj, name, &val, errp)) {
        ... bail out ...
    }
    ... use val ...

It isn't for calls that use the value without storing it in a variable
first.
