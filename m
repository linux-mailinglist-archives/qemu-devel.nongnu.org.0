I assume the "max" model should at least be consistent, see below.

I do agree that the use case of "max" for detecting which features can=20
be enabled for any CPU model is quite simplified and would also not work=20
like this on s390x. It really means "give me the maximum/latest/greatest=20
you can". Some examples on s390x:

On s390x, we don't allow to enable new features for older CPU=20
generation. "vx" was introduced with a z13. If "max" is a z13, it can=20
include "vx", if available. However, if you select a z12 (zEC12), you=20
cannot enable "vx":

"Feature '%s' is not available for CPU model '%s', it was introduced=20
with later models."

Also, we have dependency checks=20
(target/s390x/cpu_models.c:check_consistency()), that at least warn on=20
inconsistencies between features (feature X requires feature Y).

We would need more fine-grained "max" models. E.g., z13-max vs. z13-best=20
vs. z13-base.

- z13-max: Maximum features that can be enabled on the current
            accel/host for a z13.
- z13-best: Best features that can be enabled on the current
            accel/host for a z13.
- z13-base: base feature set, independent of current
            accel/host for a z13. (we do have this already on s390x)
