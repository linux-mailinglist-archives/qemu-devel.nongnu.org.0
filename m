strace shows the problem:

add_key("user", "qemu_test_secret", "Test Payload", 12,
KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING) =3D -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)

It appears systemd-nspawn containers don't have CAP_SYS_ADMIN which is
apparently needed for the keyring stuff to work. Fair enough.

But the underlying problem here is configure switch `--disable-keyring'
does not work. It previously worked in the 5.1.0 release but now it's
broken.

Title:
  Test failure in test-crypto-secret.c

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When running qemu test suite I'm seeing a test failure:

  ERROR:../qemu/tests/test-crypto-secret.c:144:test_secret_keyring_good:
  assertion failed: (key >=3D 0)

  Host is Arch Linux running in the standard Arch build environment
  (essentially an nspawn container).

  I first noticed this at release of 5.1.0 but it's still there on
  current trunk. For 5.1.0 I was able to sidestep the issue by building
  with `--disable-keyring' but this no longer works (I think due to
  9866a33cbb7046891dec3dcc9ca2015828673afe)

  Any clues on what might be the cause? Not sure how to debug.
