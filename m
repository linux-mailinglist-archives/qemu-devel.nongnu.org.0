From: Kashyap Chamarthy <kchamart@redhat.com>

I completely botched up the merged[0] rST conversion of this document by
accidentally dropping entire hunks (!) of text. :-(  I made it very hard
for reviewers to spot it, as the omitted text was buried deep in the
document.  To fix my hatchet job, I reconverted the "SubmitAPatch"
wiki[1] page from scratch and replaced the existing rST with it, while
making sure I incorporated previous feedback.

In summary, in this reconverted edition:

- I did a careful (to the extent my eyes allowed) para-by-para
  comparison of the wiki and the rST to make sure I didn't omit
  anything accidentally.

- I made sure to work in the cosmetic feedback[2] that Thomas Huth
  pointed out in the merged (and botched) edition:

   - fix the hyperlinks in "Split up long patches"

   - replace ".". with "does not end with a dot" (in "Write a meaningful
     commit message" section)

   - replace "---" with ``---`` so that it doesn't render as an em-dash
     (there were two other occurrences; I fixed those too)

- Use "QEMU" spelling consistently in prose usage

- Add a consistent "refer to git-config" link where appropriate

Thanks to Thomas Huth and Alex Benn√©e for noticing it on IRC.  And sorry
for my sloppiness.

+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Although QEMU has `continuous integration
+services <Testing#Continuous_Integration>`__ that attempt to test
+patches submitted to the list, it still saves everyone time if you have
+already tested that your patch compiles and works. Because QEMU is such
+a large project, it's okay to use configure arguments to limit what is
+built for faster turnaround during your development time; but it is
+still wise to also check that your patches work with a full build before
+submitting a series, especially if your changes might have an unintended
+effect on other areas of the code you don't normally experiment with.
+See `Testing <Testing>`__ for more details on what tests are available.
+Also, it is a wise idea to include a testsuite addition as part of your
+patches - either to ensure that future changes won't regress your new
+feature, or to add a test which exposes the bug that the rest of your
+series fixes. Keeping separate commits for the test and the fix allows
+reviewers to rebase the test to occur first to prove it catches the
+problem, then again to place it last in the series so that bisection
+doesn't land on a known-broken state.

+Submitting a Pull Request
+=========================
 
 QEMU welcomes contributions of code, but we generally expect these to be
 sent as simple patch emails to the mailing list (see our page on
-`submitting a patch
-<https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/devel/submitting-a-patch.html>`__

 will need to submit pull requests, although occasionally for a large
 patch series we might ask a submitter to send a pull request. This page
