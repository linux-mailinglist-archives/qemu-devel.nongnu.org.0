FWIU The goal of this test is to compare the acpi tables generated by
qemu against reference ones. I dont think we expect from the FW any
specific result but I would prefer Igor or Michael to confirm.

In that case, removing the assert() allows to compare the specific DSDT
and TPM2 tables and that's our expectation here I think.
