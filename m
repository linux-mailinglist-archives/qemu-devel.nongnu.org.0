Yes, 'from' sounds nicer, especially since the size requirements being 
measured depend on the destination's cluster size (which may be 
different from the source's cluster size).

If the source format does not support bitmaps, there is nothing to copy 
over.  Reporting '0' would work, but adds verbosity.  It also becomes a 
question as to whether 'qemu-img convert --bitmaps' should silently 
ignore such sources, or loudly error out that the option is unsupported 
because the source lacks bitmaps.  I could lean either way.

The impact to the iotests .out files is larger if I do not require that 
the source supports bitmaps (more lines of 'bitmaps: 0' added).  I'm 
fine doing that, if we decide we're okay with the simpler definition of 
'"bitmaps" is present if the destination supports them' (rather than 
this version's implementation of '"bitmaps" is present if both the 
source and destination support them').

In fact, that argument is a GOOD reason to output 'bitmaps: 0' in as 
many cases as possible, because it then becomes a side-effect witness of 
whether 'qemu-img convert --bitmaps' is even understood.

Yes, I can make that tweak for v4.
