I didn't fully understand this to be honest.

I just wanted to explain what I know and what I don't know about hardware barriers.

I know that read barriers should be paired with write barriers, like if one CPU has a write barrier,
which ensures the orders of writes to two memory locations, the other CPU can then use a read barrier to ensure
that it sees those writes in this order.

I thus think that reads of dev->realized should be paired with read barrier, 
but here a full memory barrier isn't really needed.
