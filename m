Hmm... I didn't find a good and clean way to cover what Dave has mentioned.
Everything would be either ugly or even uglier.  Sad.

Since I didn't get any feedback either on this for some time (or the rest of
the discussion threads or proposals I opened), I think it's time to move on...
I start to feel unwise to continue have the two kvm dirty ring series blocked
due to this extremely corner case of race condition, after all it's not a
specific problem to kvm dirty ring but to both of the methods.  I'll continue
with dirty ring for now, then we fix the race altogether with dirty log when we
find some better solution.

I'll soon post a new QEMU version, keeping the removing memslot sync operation,
but just like dirty log it'll be a best effort sync (e.g. PML ignored).
However I'll comment to at least mention the issues we've found so we can get
to it later again.

Thanks,
