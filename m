Even downstream in RHEL that is not actually valid anymore. Container
based deployment has killed any assumptions that can be made in this
respect. Even if the userspace and kernel are updated in lockstep in
a particular RHEL release, you cannot assume the running environment
will have a matched pair.

Users can be running QEMU userspace from RHEL-8.5 inside a container
that has been deployed on a host using a 8.3 kernel. We've even had
cases of running QEMU from RHEL-8, on a RHEL-7 host.

Daniel
