We have the "max" model just like other architectures

s390 max             Enables all features supported by the accelerator=20
in the current host

It is basically the "host" model under KVM, and the "qemu" model under=20
TCG (with minor differences for the latter).


This series introduces e.g.,

s390 z900-best       IBM zSeries 900 GA1 with best features supported by=20
the accelerator in the current host

s390 z14-best        IBM z14 GA1 with best features supported by the=20
accelerator in the current host

s390 z14ZR1-best     IBM z14 Model ZR1 GA1 with best features supported=20
by the accelerator in the current host

s390 gen15a-best     IBM z15 GA1 with best features supported by the=20
accelerator in the current host

s390 gen15b-best     IBM 8562 GA1 with best features supported by the=20
accelerator in the current host


There is a small but important difference between "max"/"host" and=20
"best". Max really means "all features", including deprecated ones.=20
"best", however, can disable experimental or deprecated features. Or any=20
other features we don't want to be enabled when somebody selects a model=20
manually.

On s390x, the feature "csske" is deprecated. New HW still has it, but we=20
want new guests to run without this facility. Dropping it from "max"=20
would affect existing setups. We already changed the default model=20
(e.g., -cpu z13) to disable it with never QEMU machines.

E.g., nested virtualization features on some architectures could be a=20
feature set you want to disable, although contained in the "max" model.=20
(e.g., no migration support yet).


I am not completely against calling these "max" models instead of "best"=20
models, but I think this makes it clearer that there is indeed a difference=
.

Maybe, we even want a "-cpu best" that would not map to "-cpu=20
host"/"-cpu max", but to a cleaned up "-cpu host"/"-cpu max" (e.g.,=20
disable deprecated features). Long term, we might even want to change=20
the default when no "-cpu" is specified to "-cpu best" - which should=20
now be possible with the latest QEMU changes to query the default model=20
for a specific QEMU machine.

--=20
