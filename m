I thought of something similar, but how would that look on the command line=
?

Though I suppose if the worst thing were how it looks on the command
line, we could introduce a new qemu-img subcommand that then internally
translates into the right amend syntax.

Hm, well, I would have assumed this is only bad on the premise that we
want to have amend be complete at some point.  Do we?

While I do think it might be nice to be able to change e.g. cluster_size
especially for the upcoming subcluster extension (in addition to
enabling subclusters on an existing image), I seriously doubt anyone=E2=80=
=99s
going to implement it.  (Maybe enabling subclusters, but not changing
cluster_size.)

> I think we need to find a solution for the amend API.

I do think it=E2=80=99s weird to look for non-amend solutions when it clear=
ly
looks like an amend problem, but OTOH I don=E2=80=99t think it would be tha=
t bad
to disregard amend.  (Provided there are good reasons for disregarding it.)
