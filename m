You explain behavior on success.  The issue is behavior on failure.

Yes, opt_set() becomes a bit of a misnomer: it doesn't add a QemuOpt to
@opts, it validates a QemuOpt against its key's description, if @opts
has descriptions.

Hmm, opt_set() is now almost identical to qemu_opts_validate()'s loop
body.  Perhaps I can de-duplicate.

Valid point.

We don't strdup() there because opts_do_parse() extracts the value with
get_opt_name(), which strdup()s it.  strdup()ing it some more isn't
wrong, I just dislike it.

Let me try the de-duplication, and then we'll see whether you still
dislike the patch.
