Ideally we could just relpace qemu_mutex with g_mutex, but if that's
not possible we would have to create a clone of GMutexLocker as
QemuMutexLocker doing exactly the same thing. It is a shame to reinvent
the wheel with our threading code though.

/me tries to remember what it was that we can do with QEMU's threads
that we can't do with GLib's threads.
