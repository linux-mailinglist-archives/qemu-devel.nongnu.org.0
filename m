I think this is part of maintainability in a wider sense.  For every
missing feature there should be a good reason why it's not needed.  And
if there is already code to do that in QEMU, then there should be an
excellent reason why it's not being used.  (This was the essence of the
firmware debate).

So for microvm you could do without hotplug because the idea is that you
just tear down the VM and restart it.  Lack of MSI is actually what
worries me the most, but we could say that microvm clients generally
have little multiprocessing so it's not common to have multiple network
flows at the same time and so you don't need multiqueue.

For microvm in particular there are two reasons why we can take some
shortcuts (but with care):

- we won't support versioned machine types for microvm.  microvm guests
die every time you upgrade QEMU, by design.  So this is not another QED,
which implemented more features than qcow2 but did so at the wrong place
of the stack.  In fact it's exactly the opposite (it implements less
features, so that the implementation of e.g. q35 or PCI is untouched and
does not need one-off boot time optimization hacks)

- we know that Amazon is using something very similar to microvm in
production, with virtio-mmio, so the feature set is at least usable for
something.

Even though we won't support versioned machine types, I think there is
agreement that virtio 0.9 is a bad idea and should be fixed.
