The lack of deterministic behaviour would worry me. If the caller can't
be sure whether the unallocated portions of the device will be zeroed or
not, it feels as though the number of potential use cases is reduced.

The optimisation is focused on images where there are a significant
number of allocated zero blocks. Is that a common case? (It obviously
exists, because many images generated before "--target-is-zero" will be
like that, but perhaps they would be better cleaned by an unallocator.)

"unallocated blocks may not be written" would be fine.
