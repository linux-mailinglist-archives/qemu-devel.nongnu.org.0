** Description changed:

  I'm not actually sure how far I can help as I so far failed to reproduce
  the issue on my local VM but I get it on Travis CI every time. I even
  went through the hassle of hacking a Debian repository into their Ubuntu
  Bionic VM to get qemu 4.2 as I hoped a new version could fix this.
  =

+ This build runs in an armv6h chroot. I don't get the segfault if I do
+ the same on an armv7h chroot for some reason.
+ =

  Here is where the error occured: https://travis-
  ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/309106220#L5420
- =

- I don't get this error with an armv7h chroot.
  =

  Maybe now I'll just try to remove all uses of svn in my build scripts...
  =

  Is it actually a viable solution to cross-build with qemu? I'm starting
  to doubt it...
  =

  Would it help if I manage to get this core dump out of Travis somehow
  (maybe make Travis push it to some GIT or upload it to my webserver)?
