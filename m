Yes, it's doable. It's not a very nice command line, but it does its
job.

What do we win by removing pretty printing from qemu? We invest some
work doing the patches, reviewing them, etc. and save the whole
complexity of adding a few newlines and spaces to an already existing
string buffer in a single place (qjson.c).

In exchange, we have to add the above overlong command line to every
qemu-iotests case for which pretty printed QMP is useful, and lose the
ability to just do -qmp-pretty stdio manually (which I do every now and
then) instead of having to dig up the above line in some script to copy
it.

It doesn't look like a net win to me.

The pretty printing is fairly trivial in C, too, when you already
generate JSON. The code seems to have been last touched in 2014, and
before that in 2010 when it was introduced. The maintenance burden
doesn't seem to be that bad.

Removing features that have users can be justified sometimes, but it
does need a justification, in my opinion.
