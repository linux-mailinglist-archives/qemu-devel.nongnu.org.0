Title:
  qemu arm no longer able to boot RPI Kernels

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Since RPi Kernel 1.20170427, qemu is no longer able to emulate the
  Rasberry Pi, as the linux kernel is complaining about timing issues.

  Old kernel output - https://pastebin.com/wvkneNNF
  New kernel output - https://pastebin.com/QTwgCkV2

  Note that the actual error is caused by the kernel being unable to get
  the timing source for the mmc (Line 160), which causes an unable-to-
  mount-root panic.  There are other issues with the serial port
  returning an invalid speed, which displays a divide-by-zero error,
  which is PROBABLY a symptom of the same root cause.

  This is simple to replicate - The last working kernel is available
  here:

  https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/1.20170405/boot

  Download kernel7 and the dtb, and try to boot with (for example)

  qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi2 -kernel kernel7.img -dtb
  bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -serial stdio -sd noobs.img -append
  "root=3D/dev/mmcblk0p2 init=3D/bin/bash"

  This works, and boots successfully.

  However, if you replace the kernel7.img and dtb with ones taken from
  https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/1.20170427/boot it will
  NOT boot because of various clock timing issues (as in the second
  paste)
