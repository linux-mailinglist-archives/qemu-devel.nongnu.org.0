Earlier today I grabbed two Weiwei Li patches (isa_string changes and Zca/Zcf/Zcd
changes) in the "rework CPU extensions validation" series, but after reading these
last messages I guess I jumped the gun.

Alistair, I'm considering drop the patch that disables extensions via priv_spec later
during realize() (the one I mentioned in my first message) from that series until we
figure the best way of dealing with priv spec and Z-extensions being used as MISA bits
and so on. We can merge those cleanups and write_misa() changes that are already reviewed
in the meantime. Are you ok with that?


Thanks,


Daniel
