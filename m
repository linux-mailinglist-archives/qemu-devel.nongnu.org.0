Yep, I think this is mostly due to commit 5f9ff1eff38 ("libvhost-user:
Support tracking inflight I/O in shared memory")

It may not be that hard to bring back glib independence. Is it worth it tho=

libvhost-user.c is GPLv2-or-later because tests/vhost-user-bridge.c
was and is still as well. Do we need to change that?
