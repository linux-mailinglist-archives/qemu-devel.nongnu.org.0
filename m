Does anything really change for the AioContext that could cause a
callback? As I read the code, only the virtio-scsi device state really
changes and it doesn't do more with the AioContext than just taking the
lock for a while.

But in any case, inferring whether the HBA is ready from some AioContext
state change, even if it were technically possible, is rather indirect
and more a hack than a proper solution in my book. So a callback from
the HBA to its bus feels like the correct approach.
