Incidentally I'm really suprised you even hit the 'no free port'
scenario. I've never seen that happen unless the machine was
basically doomed due to something leaking open sockets by the
10's of 1000's.

You mention firewall settings above, but I don't think that's
relevant. The find_free_port() call is with no args, so it
gets set to 'address=localhost' which means is_port_free
takes the bind() codepath. The firewall has no interaction
with the bind() codepath in the kernel AFAIK. 

Regards,
Daniel
