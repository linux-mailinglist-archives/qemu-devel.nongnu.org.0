I think it's wrong logic. It leads to crashes for images unaligned to 4k.

Oh, I see, so to QEMU it looked like it would do O_DIRECT and probing
was done, but what was actually opened was non-direct. Not sure if we
could possibly distinguish a situation like this from one where O_DIRECT
succeeds with byte alignment because the block was unallocated, but
would require larger alignment later.

Yes, I agree, it should be checked while opening the image.
