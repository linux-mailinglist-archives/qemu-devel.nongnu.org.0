Yes this is a better perspective.  It's not the first time I totally
forgot to go back to reference the bare-metal as that's what we're
emulating and normally that'll have very similar problem.  And the
"data point" email does give a proper supporting material for this.

After re-read Michael's reply, I feel like what Michael suggested is
that we can simply ignore the bus-number-change case by the guest OS
for now, but I might be wrong.  In all cases, this will be a problem
only if "we still need to fill in the BDF information" somehow, while
that statement seems to be questionable now.

Thanks,
