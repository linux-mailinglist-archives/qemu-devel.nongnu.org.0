The doc generator is stupid and greedy (which also makes it
predictable): a module's documentation is emitted where it is first
included.

For full control of the order, have the main module include all
sub-modules in the order you want.

Alternatively, add just enough includes to get the order you want.

I doubt implementing this feature would pay back the invested time.
Manually controlling the order like I described above is not much of a
burden, isn't it?
