The trouble with migration is that there are alot of subtle permutations
that interact in wierd ways, so we've got alot of test scenarios, includuing
many with TLS:

Each takes about 4 seconds, except for the xbzrle, autoconverge and
vcpu-dirty-rate tests which take 8-12 seconds.

We could short-circuit most of the tls tests, because 90% of what
they're validating is the initial connection setup phase. We don't
really need to run the full migration to completion, we can just
abort once we're running. Just keep 3 doing the full migration
to completion - one precopy, one postcopy and one multifd.

That'd cut most of thte TLS tests from 4 seconds to 0.5 seconds.

With regards,
Daniel
