If I understand help correctly, you can hot-add a gdbserver with HMP
command gdbserver.  Makes me think ...

... David's "why not use gdb" should be considered once more.

Your point "while it's possible to trace the stack with nothing but
x/16g and a general purpose programming language, we shouldn't make our
users jump through this hoop" is valid.

However, the new command is actually competing with gdb.  How much of
gdb do we want to build into QEMU to avoid the inconvenience of having
to install gdb and hot-add a gdb server?
