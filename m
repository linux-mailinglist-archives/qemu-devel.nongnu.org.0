Ok, that's true - QEMU is really a huge project. I'd really recommend to
pick some topics from https://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/BiteSizedTasks
first to get a feeling for contributing patches to QEMU. Since you're
interested in emulation, maybe the topics from the "Device models"
section would also be a good fit?

Oh, well, thanks, ok, that was too easy. I guess there are just too many
abbreviations around ;-)

I'd recommend to browse the various KVM forum presentations on
http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Category:Conferences to see if there is
something that catches your eye. You can find the recordings of most
presentations on
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRCSQmAOh7yzgheq-emy1xA , too.

Sure, but I think you first need a target you're interested in first.
E.g. do you want to focus on x86, ARM, PPC, m68k, ... ? Depending on
that, you can start looking around in the hw/ directory for "missing" or
"TODO" items.
