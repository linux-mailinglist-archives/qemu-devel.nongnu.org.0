It seems 8250 retries, but never drops data. s->tsr_retry is always
1 when neither G_IO_OUT nor G_IO_HUP happens. In that case, there is
always a asynchronous IO handler (serial_xmit()), which will be scheduled
on event G_IO_OUT, apart from G_IO_HUP. I don't think the event will be
triggered in our this particular case. This eventually has UART_LSR_THRE
cleared in LSR (0x5) to hold upper layer. So there is no data lost if I'm
correct.

It would be very rare running into successive 4 failures in 8250 because
serial_xmit() is called on G_IO_OUT event as G_IO_HUP is rare. I doubt the
logic has been ever used, maybe Marcandre Lureau knows the background.

Thanks,
Gavin
