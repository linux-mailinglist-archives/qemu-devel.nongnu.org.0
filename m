Okay. What do you think of the following?

  [
    {
      "model": "https://qemu.org/devices/e1000e",
      "params": [
        "rss",
=09...more configuration parameters...
      ],
      "versions": [
        {
=09  "name": "1",
=09  "params": [],
=09},
=09{
=09  "name": "2",
=09  "params": ["rss=3Don"],
=09},
=09...more versions...
      ]
    },
    ...more device models...
  ]

The management tool can generate the configuration parameter list by
expanding a version into its params.

Configuration parameter types and input ranges need more thought. For
example, version 1 of the device might not have rx-table-size (it's
effectively 0). Version 2 introduces rx-table-size and sets it to 32.
Version 3 raises the value to 64. In addition, the user can set a custom
value like rx-table-size=3D48. I haven't defined the rules for this yet,
but it's clear there needs to be a way to extend configuration
parameters.

To check migration compatibility:
1. Verify that the device model URL matches the JSON data[n].model
   field.
2. For every configuration parameter name from the source device,
   check that it is contained within the JSON data[n].params list.

Makes sense.
