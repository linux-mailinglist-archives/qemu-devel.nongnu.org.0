Public bug reported:

When I searched for QEMU docs in a search engine I ended up on this
page:

https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/qemu-doc.html

That is 4.2.50 documentation. It took me some time to realize that there
is actually 5.1.50 documentation under https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/
and that the 4.2 documentation is out of date.

Presumably this file is cruft that was left over from a previous build
of the website and something like a `make clean` is required?
