What is the problem with setting werror=stop and rerror=stop for the
device? Is it that QEMU won't automatically retry, but management tool
interaction is required to resume the guest?

I haven't checked your patches in detail yet, but implementing this
functionality in the backend means that blk_drain() will hang (or if it
doesn't hang, it doesn't do what it's supposed to do), making the whole
QEMU process unresponsive until the I/O succeeds again. Amongst others,
this would make it impossible to migrate away from a host with storage
problems.
