I am sorry for not providing a detailed description for Memory Side 
Cache use case. I will add more detailed description in next version of 
patch.

As the commit message and /Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst of 
Kernel HMAT(listed blow), Memory Side Cache Structure is used to provide 
the cache information about System memory for the software to use. Then 
the software can maximize the performance because it can choose the best 
node to use.

Memory Side Cache Information Structure and System Locality Latency and 
Bandwidth Information Structure can both provide more information than 
numa distance for software to see. So back to the SMBIOS, in spec, 
SMBIOS handles point to the memory side cache physical devices, but they 
are also information and not contribute to the performance of the 
described memory. The field "Proximity Domain for the Memory" can show 
the described memory.

I am wondering if this explanation is clear? Thank you.

"System memory may be constructed in a hierarchy of elements with 
various performance characteristics in order to provide large address 
space of slower performing memory cached by a smaller higher performing 
memory."

"An application does not need to know about caching attributes in order
to use the system. Software may optionally query the memory cache
attributes in order to maximize the performance out of such a setup.
If the system provides a way for the kernel to discover this 
information, for example with ACPI HMAT (Heterogeneous Memory Attribute 
Table), the kernel will append these attributes to the NUMA node memory 
target."

"Each cache level's directory provides its attributes. For example, the
following shows a single cache level and the attributes available for
software to query::

	# tree sys/devices/system/node/node0/memory_side_cache/
	/sys/devices/system/node/node0/memory_side_cache/
	|-- index1
	|   |-- indexing
	|   |-- line_size
	|   |-- size
	|   `-- write_policy
"
