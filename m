If I understand it correctly, the argument for encoding the structured
"what to yank" information into a string is ease of implementation.  The
yank core sees only strings, and doesn't care about their contents.
Code registering "yankables" can build strings however it likes, as long
as they're all distinct.  QMP clients need to understand how the strings
are built to be able to yank specific "yankables" (as opposed to blindly
yanking stuff until QEMU gets unstuck").

I disagree with this argument for a number of reasons.

1. Use of strings doesn't reduce complexity, it moves it.

   String:

   * QMP clients may need to parse the strings they get back from
     command query-yank intro structured data.

   * QMP clients may need to format structured data into a string for
     command yank.

   * How structured data is be parsed from / formatted to a string is
     part of the external interface, and needs to be documented, in
     addition to the data structure.

   * The strings need to be kept backward compatible.  We could
     inadvertently create problems like the one you described above,
     where a format like UNIQUE-PREFIX:ID with an unrestricted ID is not
     extensible.

   * Code providing "yankables" needs to somehow ensure their strings
     are distinct.

   Complex type:

   * The result of query-yank is already structured data, no need for
     QMP clients to parse.

   * The argument of yank is structured data, no need to for QMP clients
     to format it into a string first.

   * Documenting just the data structure suffices.

   * Backward compatibility of complex QMP types is a well-understood
     problem.

   * Defining the structure in the QAPI schema as union trivially
     ensures the union branches are distinct.

2. Even with structured yank arguments, the yank core doesn't *need* to
   understand the structure.

   The yank core manages a set of instances.  Each instance associates a
   key with a list of YankFuncAndParam.  This is a basically dictionary.
   All the yank core needs to do with the dictionary keys is looking
   them up.

   The proposed implementation uses a list of instances (which is just
   fine).  All the lookup needs from the keys is an "is equal" relation.

   Checking two QAPI objects for structural equality is admittedly not
   as simple as comparing strings.  It does not, however, require
   understanding their structure.  Two stupid solutions come to mind:

   * Hand-written compare that keeps specifics out of the yank core

     Whatever uses a variant of YankInstance gets to provide a
     comparison function of the variant members.

     Compare the common members (initially just @type, which is the
     discriminator).  Return false if any of them differs.

     Else both instances use the same variant.  Return the value of the
     variant comparison function.

   * Visitors exist

     Convert both YankInstances to QObject, compare with
     qobject_is_equal(), done.

3. In QMP, encoding structured data in strings is anathema :)
