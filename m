You don't need to have enum have same names to be compatible.
And in this case, all we really need is just a single number *2*
and a comment saying that's ESX server.

We really try to avoid stuff like this. If one does this one has to
check license etc etc.  But in this case, the names are confusing,
violate our coding style, I could go on.

What good does this do when that code will change tomorrow?

You worry about code being easy to write, I worry about it
being easy to read.

Here are things we can do to make things easier for users and readers:
- use full name VM executable instead of VMX
- put in official product names in comments instead of enums
- write code using our coding style
- add a link to where you found a specific number in comments

No you also copy names and comments. Which might make sense in the
context of the original project but seem to make no sense here.
E.g. for vmware a given product is deprecated but why does QEMU care?
enum values are not even listed. What is poor user supposed to do -
take out a calculator to figure it out?

Official as in will stick around, not official as in pushed to
a github repo.

Something like the below.
