Well that looks better than what is done for the JEOS images currently
on avocado-project.org, as I can't tell what distro those came from
at all.

If we're hosting images built by some 3rd party, and we intend to rely
on the 3rd party to satisfy source availability, then we need to be sure
that the 3rd party is themselves still distributing the same images.

IIUC, from Cleber's commit here the original images we're pointing to
are now 404s. If the URLs moved, we just need to update to fix the URLs
to point the new location. If the content was entirely removed though,
we shouldn't mirror it ourselves, because we can't rely on the original
vendor to be providing the source at that point.

Regards,
Daniel
