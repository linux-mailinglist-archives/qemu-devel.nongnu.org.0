The former.  QAPI supports 'if' in partially since 3.0, and fully since
4.0.

Making the QAPI schema reflect the underlying C code's ifdeffery can
help QMP clients.  Compare:

* query-qmp-schema reports member "native" even when attempting to use
  it will always fail.

* It reports member "io_uring" only when it can work.

This is particularly useful when a QMP client has logic like "do it this
way if X is available, else do it that way".  With accurate
introspection, you can check whether X is available safely and easily.
Without introspection, you'll likely have to try "this way", and if it
fails, figure out why, so you can decide whether to try "that way".
Worse when a multi-step "this way" fails half way through, and you get
to revert its initial steps.
