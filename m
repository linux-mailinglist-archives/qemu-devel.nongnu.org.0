Side effect - this created an image (which gets cleaned up when 
skipping, so no problem there)...

...and this recreates the same image.  You could drop this line as 
redundant.

The duplication of '# Test xyz' and 'echo "=== Test xyz"' is awkward; 
you can safely delete the redundant # lines.

This creates a file named '1' populated with stderr from qemu-img.  I 
don't think that was your intent; you probably meant 2>&1 (if you wanted 
stderr to be logged with the rest of this script's output).

Although this is valid bash, the use of (()) is documented as being 
something you should avoid in modern scripts (it can be confused for a 
nested subshell).  So, rewriting these last few lines:

if $QEMU_IMG info "$TEST_IMG" 2>&1 >/dev/null ; then
     echo "Error ..."
fi

Another bad redirect,

and another awkward (()).

We recently added peek_file_be in common.rc that would be a lot nicer 
than writing your own od command line.  Use it as:

peek_file_be "$TEST_IMG" 104 1

In the meantime, you can make this test robust, by adding up front 
(copying from test 197 for example):

# Sanity check: our use of $RAND_FILE fails if $TEST_DIR contains spaces
# or other problems
case "$TEST_DIR" in
     *[^-_a-zA-Z0-9/]*)
         _notrun "Suspicious TEST_DIR='$TEST_DIR', cowardly refusing to 
run" ;;
esac

You test that data read in as compressed in zlib and written back out as 
zstd compares as equal, which is not quite as strong as whether what is 
read back out matches the original $RAND_FILE, but this is still a 
pretty good round-trip test (it did not prove whether zlib is 
corruption-free, but does show that zstd is coruption-free, and the 
point of this test is what zstd does).

If you want to avoid the issues with 'write -c -s $RAND_FILE' being 
risky, you could instead do:

$QEMU_IO -c "write -P 0xFA 1M 1M" "$RAND_FILE"
$QEMU_IMG convert -f raw -O $IMGFMT -c "$RAND_FILE" "$TEST_IMG"

for creating the zlib file.

Overall, I'm liking how this looks.  There are still a few shell bugs to 
clean up, and I'm not sure which maintainer will be incorporating this, 
but I'm hoping v19 goes into 5.1 rather early in the cycle.
