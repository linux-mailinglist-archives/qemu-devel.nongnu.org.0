I came to say exactly this.
While developing the nvme-mdev I also had this problem and due to assumpt=
ions built in the block layer,
you can't just let the guest wait forever for a request.

Note that Linux's nvme driver does know how to retry failed requests, inc=
luding these that timed out if that helps in any way.
