Does real HW pass in cpu[0]->env.gr[26] full 4Gb or clamped size?

Let me prepare v3 which hopefully will make is smaller and
with commit message corrected.
How about following wording:
"
    hppa: allow max ram size upto 4Gb
   =20
    Previous patch drops silent ram_size fixup and makes
    QEMU error out with:
   =20
     "RAM size more than 3840m is not supported"
   =20
    when user specified -m X more than currently supported
    value.

    However real hardware allows to plug in up to 4Gb RAM
    into memory slots. So allow user specify up to 4Gb and
    map all of it into guest address space.

PS:
    guest will still see 3840m being reported in
    cpu[0]->env.gr[26] and loose ~248Mb, as it doesn't
    have other means to discover RAM above firmware ROM.
