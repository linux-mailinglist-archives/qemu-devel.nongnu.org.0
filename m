I think from the virtualization point of view, you don't want to 
allocate unused resources. Is that why you say it is "ugly"?

 From the emulation point of view, it is easier to stay as close as 
possible to the hardware, where sometimes resources are wasted to 
simplify the design (or reduce production delays).
If it matches hardware, clamping doesn't look "ugly" to me.
