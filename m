Yeah, I understand that having to get this into the main architecture
makes this harder to change.

If there is nothing coming in the foreseeable future that would need
toleration (and not failure), it's probably not worth spending more
time on that and we should just go with this patch.

I'd recommend putting this (+ a rebuild) into stable as well, though,
so that at least 4.0-stable will tolerate signatures. (Distros
backporting this would be a good idea as well.)
