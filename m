Both patches look good to me (Acked-by: Halil Pasic
<pasic@linux.ibm.com>). I tend to agree with Davids comment on how
this information is coded: the more object oriented way would have
been to store this at the something like VirtioDeviceClass, but
Michael's argument stands.

Another OO option would be to expose this as a virtio property. Would
enable introspection, and would also give the host admin means to
force non-legacy for transitional devices. But the juice is probably not
worth the squeeze.

Halil
