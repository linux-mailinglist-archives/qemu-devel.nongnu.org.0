not familiar with the devlink. will do some research of it.

but the VFIO live migration in itself is essentially a big opaque stream to userspace.

yes, in another reply, Alex proposed to use an interface in json format.
I guess we can define something like

{ "self" :
  [
    { "pciid" : "8086591d",
      "driver" : "i915",
      "gvt-version" : "v1",
      "mdev_type"   : "i915-GVTg_V5_2",
      "aggregator"  : "1",
      "pv-mode"     : "none",
    }
  ],
  "compatible" :
  [
    { "pciid" : "8086591d",
      "driver" : "i915",
      "gvt-version" : "v1",
      "mdev_type"   : "i915-GVTg_V5_2",
      "aggregator"  : "1"
      "pv-mode"     : "none",
    },
    { "pciid" : "8086591d",
      "driver" : "i915",
      "gvt-version" : "v1",
      "mdev_type"   : "i915-GVTg_V5_4",
      "aggregator"  : "2"
      "pv-mode"     : "none",
    },
    { "pciid" : "8086591d",
      "driver" : "i915",
      "gvt-version" : "v2",
      "mdev_type"   : "i915-GVTg_V5_4",
      "aggregator"  : "2"
      "pv-mode"     : "none, ppgtt, context",
    }
    ...
  ]
}

But as those fields are mostly vendor specific, the userspace can
only do simple string comparing, I guess the list would be very long as
it needs to enumerate all possible targets.
also, in some fileds like "gvt-version", is there a simple way to express
things like v2+?

If the userspace can read this interface both in src and target and
check whether both src and target are in corresponding compatible list, I
think it will work for us.

But still, kernel should not rely on userspace's choice, the opaque
compatibility string is still required in kernel. No matter whether
it would be exposed to userspace as an compatibility checking interface,
vendor driver would keep this part of code and embed the string into the
migration stream. so exposing it as an interface to be used by libvirt to
do a safety check before a real live migration is only about enabling
the kernel part of check to happen ahead.
