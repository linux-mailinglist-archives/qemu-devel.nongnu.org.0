Or introduce a new 'id' field that are refer to a qdev ID, since
we can assign IDs to VNC/SPICE server instances too, when there
are multiple instances, and they'll be non-overlapping with
chardev IDs ?

IOW we make 'protocol' and 'id' both optional in QAPI schema, and
declare them mutually exclusive. Deprecate 'protocol' in favour
of 'id'. Then eventually delete 'protocol' and make 'id'
mandatory.

Opps, I meant to say that libvirt only uses add_client for
graphics devices. We've never used it for chardevs AFAICT.
