Title:
  Direct Sound Audio does not stop

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  The Bug:
  DirectSound Audio does not stop because dsound_ctl_out does not end up ca=
lling IDirectSoundBuffer_Stop. This is due to a bug in dsound_get_status_ou=
t where the status flags returned from IDirectSoundBuffer_GetStatus are com=
pared with DSERR_BUFFERLOST (an error code) rather than DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOS=
T (a status flag). The status is actually (DSBSTATUS_LOOPING | DSBSTATUS_PL=
AYING) and one of those flags happens to be set in the DSERR_BUFFERLOST val=
ue. As a result, dsound_get_status_out returns -1 and dsound_ctl_out exits =
before calling IDirectSoundBuffer_Stop.

  The Fix:
  A simple replacement of DSERR_BUFFERLOST with DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST in dso=
und_get_status_out. =

  Should be: "if (*statusp & DSBSTATUS_BUFFERLOST) {"

  Version Information:
  I was able to produce this bug in Qemu 2.9.0 and with the latest source p=
ulled from git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git (commit 8dfaf23ae1). I was a=
ble to verify my suggested fix with the latest source.

  Guest OS:
  Discovered running Minoca OS v0.4 (www.github.com/minoca/os). Images at h=
ttps://www.minocacorp.com/download/nightlies/latest-x86. The Qemu test imag=
es I tried (http://wiki.qemu.org/Testing/System_Images) didn't have an easy=
 sound setup (was looking for 'aplay' or similar).

  Qemu Command Line:
  ./qemu-system-x86_64.exe -m 512 -hda pc.img -smp 4 -usbdevice keyboard -d=
evice intel-hda -device hda-duplex
