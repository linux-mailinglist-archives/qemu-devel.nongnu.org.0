The problem was with OpenBSD 6.1 which hadn't xz available.

In commit 12745eaa02 Gerd updated the VM to OpenBSD 6.5 and we now have=20
access to xz. IIRC OSX supported versions also provide xz.

If we want to revert Laszlo's patches and apply his first version (using=20
xz), we should do that during 5.0 dev cycle, now it is too late.
I'd prefer we simply fix bzip2 for the next release.
