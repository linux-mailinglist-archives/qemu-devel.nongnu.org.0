I think it's neat there's enough interest in ZNS that we have multiple
solutions to consider.

I'm still catching up from virtual conferencing, but I should be able to have a
look over the weekend. I know everyone's put a lot of work into the development

yet if that's feasible, but I'll have a better idea on that later.
