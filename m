BTW, frequent users of gitlab CI should check their forks too

  https://gitlab.com/$USERNAME/qemu/-/usage_quotas

I'm a bit of an extreme case since I run sooooo many pipelines when
working on CI configs, but I was using about 450 GB in my fork !

I can recommend Erik's cleaner script linked above, works fine for
forks too.

We don't really have control over how stuff is stored. GitLab just
captures stdout/err from the jobs and presents that. Our options are
keep it, or delete it. For anything else, we would have to download
it and store it oursdide of gitlab, which doesn't look like its a
good use of time.

Daniel
