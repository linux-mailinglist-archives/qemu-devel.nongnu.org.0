... this doesn't seem to be a VNC-only issue.. I get quite the big of
repeat/stuck key presses with the GTK frontend as well.. Also, lines
like these frequently show up in the logs:

Title:
  Super important feature req: QEMU VNC server: Introduce a keyboard
  "norepeat" option!

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hi,

  A big issue when using QEMU's VNC server (VNC KVM) is that, when
  there's a network lag, unintended keypresses go through to the QEMU
  guest VM.

  This is frequently "enter" keypresses, causing all kinds of unintended
  consequences in the VM. So basically it's extremely dangerous.

  This is because the VNC protocol's keyboard interaction is implemented
  in terms of key down - key up events, making the server's keyboard
  autorepeat kick in when it should not.

  =

  For this reason, it would be great if QEMU's VNC server part would be enh=
anced with an option such that when a VNC protocol key down is received, th=
en locally that is treated as one single keypress only (I don't know how th=
at should be implemented but I guess either as an immediate key down - key =
up sequence locally, or key down + key up after say 0.05 seconds), instead =
of waiting for the key up event from the VNC client.

  Thanks!
