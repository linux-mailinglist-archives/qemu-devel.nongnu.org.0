The point of adding the masterkeylen was that IMHO it wasn't clear that
luks->header.key_bytes is the master key length.

However defining something like qcrypto_block_luks_master_key_len(QCrypto=
BlockLUKS *luks)=20
is way longer, and will force me to wrap just too many places in the code=
 to keep 80
character limit.

Now I am thinking of other ways to make this thing better:

1. How about adding luks->masterkeylen and using it. luks state already h=
as
several parsed values from the header, so using another one wouldn't hurt=
?


2. how about renaming the luks->header.key_bytes to luks->header->master_=
key_len?
