Good idea! ... but it does not work quite yet, I gave it a try and ended
up here:

I think we should finally go with your approach and compile the fuzzing
test via the script. But since that seems to need some more work first,
let's go with my patch now, so that we have something for 5.1-rc1, and
then when your patch is ready, replace my "build-fuzzer" job with yours, ok?

Ok, thanks, I'll add that.

I did not include the virtio-net fuzzers because I read that warning
"May result in network traffic emitted from the  process. Run in an
isolated network environment." in the help text ... so I was not sure
whether they are really suitable for the CI on the gitlab machines?
