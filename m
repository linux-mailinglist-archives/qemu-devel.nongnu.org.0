Doesn't "separated by" imply that?

What about

    * Repetition: Expression A... matches zero or more occurences of
      expression A
    * Repetition: Expression A, ... matches zero or more occurences of
      expression A separated by ,

Yes from a purely semantic point of view.

No when you look at the generated text: that's in source order.  Should
not matter for C.  Does matter for documentation.

See also discussion of previous patch.

Language change.  Not sure anything outside tests would break.  But why

We've wanted that for a while.  Max has patches:

They need review.

A flat union with *no* branches is actually valid as long as the
discriminator enum has values.

Not possible for simple unions and alternates, where the enum is
inferred.  Could turn the semantic constraint into syntax just for them,
but I feel it's too much notational overhead.

Besides, I'm sitting on patches that separate checking this second layer
of syntax from checking semantics, and "unions need branches" ends up in
the semantics part.  That's another reason for not doing it in syntax
here.

If we needed it multiple times, then something like

    * Repetition: Expression A * matches zero or more occurences of
      expression A
    * Repetition: Expression A, * matches zero or more occurences of
      expression A separated by ,
    * Repetition: Expression A + matches one or more occurences of
      expression A
    * Repetition: Expression A, + matches one or more occurences of
      expression A separated by ,

could be helpful.  But I can't see the need right now.

*If* we decide we the benefit is worth the complexity.

Yes, that's better.
