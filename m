I'm not sure I understand this connection. mypy doesn't care about
style.

Max can't be the wrongest person for it because that's already me.

...here I must say that while I think Max's suggestions feel like an
improvement to me over the patch, I actually like the current code best
in both cases.

In fact, after scanning your patch, I feel it's actually the majority of
changes that pylint wants that aren't an improvement... Maybe this just
underlines the fact that I am the wrongest person to review such patches
and not Max. Though I'm surprised that I'm generally not the person who
introduces the code violating the rules, and I don't have the impression
in this thread that anyone is eager to defend pylint's opinion.

Now I ran pylint myself and it prints some even more ridiculous warnings
like variable names being too short for its liking. I guess this means
that if we want to run it without warnings or errors, we need to use a
config file anyway to disable the worst parts.

And if we have a config file anyway, maybe we can more selectively
enable the checks that we actually want?
