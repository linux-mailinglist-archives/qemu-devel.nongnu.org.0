I guess that's right. :-(

At the same time, switching HMP to coroutines would give us an easy way
to fix the problem: Just use a CoMutex so that HMP and QMP commands
never run in parallel. Unless we actually _want_ to run both at the same
time for some commands, but I don't see why.

While we don't have this, maybe it's worth considering if there is
another simple way to achieve the same thing. Could QMP just suspend all
HMP monitors while it's executing a command? At first sight it seems
that this would work only for "interactive" monitors.

If the handler doesn't yield, it's still trivial. So I think my original
statement that with the existing QMP handlers, the problem is with code
that behaves different between coroutine and non-coroutine calls, is
still true because that is the only code that could possibly yield with
existing QMP command handlers.

Of course, you're right that handlers that actually can yield need to be
careful that they can deal with whatever happens until they are
reentered. And that seems to include HMP handlers.
