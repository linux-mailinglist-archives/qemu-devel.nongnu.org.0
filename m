I'm not an rST expert, but trust that you compared the resulting 
renderings.  Is there a quick recipe for doing the build locally so I 
can easily inspect local artifacts myself?

Reasonable.

All fine by me.  If the resulting docs are more consistent between tools 
as a result of normalizations like this, it is a win.

Yes, that's fair for the short-term.

Worth splitting this long line, either with \-newline, or

with additional DOCS+= lines?

Would I be taking this patch through my NBD tree, or would you be 
bundling it with other doc patches?

Pre-existing poor grammar. Better might be:

Use *filename* as an external snapshot, by creating a temporary file 
with ``backing_file=``\ *filename*, and redirecting writes to the 
temporary file.

But that could also be done as a separate patch, to keep this one as 
mechanical as possible on the conversion.

Hmm - this example uses the deprecated --partition. And it was 
deprecated in 4.0.0. So 5.0 is a reasonable time to just nuke that code, 
and therefore this example - but as a separate patch (rather than 
touching up this example to use the spelling suggested in 
qemu-deprecated.texi).
