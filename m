The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Add multiboot2 support

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  multiboot2 is a recent specification that resolves some of the issues
  of multiboot. Multiboot2 is supported by some tools already (e.g.
  grub).

  It would be great if one can run OS with multiboot2 using '-kernel'
  option, similar as it is done now with multiboot images.

  Quick googling shows there is a Debian bug and patch that adds
  multiboot support https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-
  bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D621529 Would it be possible to integrate it to
  QEMU upstream?
