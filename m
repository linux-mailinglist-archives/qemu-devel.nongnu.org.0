Well, the explanation is simpler: Nobody ran the
device-introspection-test with the arm target in slow mode! Hardly
anybody runs the tests with SPEED=slow, and in the CI, we currently only
run the test in slow mode for the i386-softmmu, ppc64-softmmu and
mips64-softmmu targets. Simply because testing with arm was toooo slow
when I wrote that CI script, I didn't want to wait endlessly here.

But now with the speedup patch from Daniel, and maybe with some smarter
checks in the YML file (I now know that there are things like "only:
changes:" keywords so we could e.g. only run that test if something in
hw/arm/* has changed), I think it should be feasible to get this
included in the CI, too.
