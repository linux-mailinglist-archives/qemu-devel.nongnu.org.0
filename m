Title:
  segfault upon reboot

Status in QEMU:
  Won't Fix

  The qemu-kvm segfault happens when I issue a reboot on the Windows VM. Th=
e card I have is:
  1a:00.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS1068E PCI-E=
xpress Fusion-MPT SAS (rev ff)

  I have two of these cards (bought with many years difference), exact same=
 model, and they fail the same way. I'm using PCI passthrough on this card =
for access to the tape drive.
  This is very easy to reproduce, so feel free to let me know what to try.
  Kernel 3.10.0-327.18.2.el7.x86_64 (Centos 7.2.1511).
  qemu-kvm-1.5.3-105.el7_2.4.x86_64
  Reporting it here because of the segfault, but I guess I might have to op=
en a bug report with mptbase as well?
