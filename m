I'll re-investigate. I definitely fixed some of this (there is if=3DIDE
for AHCI now), but I recall Markus mentioning recently that there are a
lot of weird things quite broken with AHCI and bus assignment.

I'm working on several other IDE fixes for the next release, so we can
add this one to the pile. I will leave it as "incomplete" for now since
I need to re-assess.

Title:
  -device ide-hd will assign bus with with no free units

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Originally filed here:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1000118

  ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -device ahci -drive id=3Daa,file=3D/t=
mp/foo,if=3Dnone -drive id=3Dbb,file=3D/tmp/foo,if=3Dnone -device ide-hd,dr=
ive=3Daa -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Can't create IDE unit 1, b=
us supports only 1 units
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Device initialization fail=
ed.
  qemu-system-x86_64: -device ide-hd,drive=3Dbb: Device 'ide-hd' could not =
be initialized

  If a bus isn't specified for -device ide-hd, it just uses the first
  bus it finds, not taking into account if that bus was already assigned
  for another device. So users are forced to do -device ide-hd,bus=3Dide.0
  -device ide-hd,bus=3Dide.1, etc.

  This isn't specific to -device ahci, but it's worse there since there
  isn't any -drive if=3DIDE or -hda convenience option, which both seem to
  get the logic correct.

  I know -device is the 'build it yourself' approach so I understand if
  this is WONTFIX.

  This is affects qemu.git as of today (8-31-2013)
