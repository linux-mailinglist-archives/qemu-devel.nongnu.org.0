From packaging point of view if something has auto* files the default is
IIRC to do in-tree build with most package managers. You have to adjust
manually for out-of-tree build. I am not sure what is state of Meson
support in packaging scripts across distributions. Most likely it will
not be picked automagically so you have to provide a custom build script
anyway. Then it is the time to look up the canonical build instructions.

In other words dealing with Meson is inconvenient either way. Building
in-tree or out-of-tree becomes a non-issue whan you switch to exotic
build system anyway.

That's not to say that auto* tools are great. It's just the replacements
have issues that are not well understood by average Joe Packager while
the auto* tools have good old issues people know how to deal with.

Thanks
