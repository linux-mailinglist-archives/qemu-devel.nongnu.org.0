As long as variants isn't re-bound in that scope, it should stick within 
that scope, yeah. (I think. Didn't test. It's my expectation.)

Yeah, understood. Well, part of it is knowing the review style of your 
reviewer too. It's been a while since we've personally swapped patches.

The actual process for much of this was: "There is an error! let me fix 
that error."

And then I do that, but I do so using idioms and patterns I'm familiar 
or comfortable with. And then post-hoc, not 100% of them were 
necessarily required, strictly, to fix the problem. Most of this series 
was written "one file at a time", and then split out post-fact into 
little per-warning changes.

I didn't even send part 1 until I finished typing the *entire* package, 
to make sure that things were as correct as possible from the very first 
commit.

I often don't really even notice that little changes aren't strictly 
necessary until they're challenged, it's usually not a conscious choice 
to try and sneak stuff in.

Still always trying to find a balance between "Easy to maintain and 
iterate" and "easy to review." Tough line for me.
