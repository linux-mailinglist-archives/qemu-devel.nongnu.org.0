I'd say it's not really relevant for backporting per se. It's relevant=20
for automatically enabling security fixes when not using the host model.=20
That part I understand. Less likely to make mistakes when explicitly=20
specifying CPU models.

I once was told that if a user actually specified an explicit CPU model=20
in the libvirt XML ("haswell-whatever"), you should not go ahead and=20
make any later changes to that model (guest ABI should not change when=20
you update/restart the guest ...). So this only applies when creating=20
new guests? Or will you change existing model definitions implicitly?

On s390x you can assume that such firmware/microcode updates will be on=20
any machine after some time. That is a big difference to x86-64 AFAIK.

So you actually want different CPU variants, which you have already,=20
just in a different form. (e.g., "haswell" will be mapped to=20
"haswell-whatever", just differently via versions)

That part I understand.

So if I do a "-cpu haswell -M whatever-machine", as far as I understood=20
reading this,  I get the "default CPU model alias for that QEMU machine"=20
and *not* the "best Haswell version that the host is able to support".

Or does the default actually also depend on the current host?

--=20
