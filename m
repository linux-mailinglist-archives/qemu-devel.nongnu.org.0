I don't think this is a good idea.  Having a completely new build system
also lets us notice all these weird one-off tests, decide whether they
are worth being kept (like the SDL -Wno-undef workaround) or not, and
possibly come up with a policy that avoids having to make one-off decisions.

If "../configure --static" worked and now doesn't then it would be a
clear regression, but a one off check should have a bigger justification
than "39 --disable switches have worked so far and 39 < 40".

Here are three alternatives to the patch:

- the workaround: just leave things as they are and add
--disable-libudev to your script.  We have just added a month ago a
completely new dependency that would have the same issue (libu2f); we
didn't add "test $static" just because you don't have libu2f installed
and therefore you didn't notice.  The day you updated your system ended
up with libu2f-dev installed, you would probably just add
--disable-libu2f instead of adding a test for $static.  So why should
libudev be treated differently?

- the cheap fix: deprecate static building of emulators in the configure
script (in the meanwhile you add --disable-libudev); if people complain,
we figure out the dependencies that they care about and we try to
understand if it's actually possible to build a statically linked
emulator for their usecase.

- the complicated fix: check which statically linked libraries are
available in e.g. Debian and disable _all_ other dependencies with
--static (most of them will be the ones that you already have to disable
 in your script, and most of them will be in configure).  Based on the
outcome, decide whether it's actually possible to build a statically
linked emulator that makes sense.

I wouldn't be surprised if people trying to statically build emulators
are getting worse performance just due to a missing static libaio or
libio_uring, for example, and these people might even be building a
statically-linked QEMU for use with KVM (like Firecracker), i.e. they
would care about performance.

Finally, no matter how we proceed, static building of system emulators
is not covered by either CI or tests/docker (only user-mode emulators
are).  Even if we deprecate it, we should make sure that your
configuration is reproduced in either Travis or GitLab, otherwise people
will keep on breaking it.  That would also document that building a
statically-linked system emulator is messy and requires a few dozen
--disable options.

Thanks,

Paolo
