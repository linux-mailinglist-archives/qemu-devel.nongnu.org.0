OK. I have no clue how real 24Kf deals with it - I don't own one -, it=20
is not in my list of interests (and my list of interests - which I can=20
reproduce - is not modeled in QEMU).

At least it appears in my MIPS32 ISA Vol II (Revision 0.95) copy from 2001:

1.2  UNPREDICTABLE and UNDEFINED

1.2.1  UNPREDICTABLE
UNPREDICTABLE results may vary from processor implementation to=20
implementation, instruction to instruction, oras a function of time on=20
the same implementation or instruction. Software can never depend on=20
results that are UNPREDICTABLE. UNPREDICTABLE operations may cause a=20
result to be generated or not. If a result is generated,it is=20
UNPREDICTABLE. UNPREDICTABLE operations may cause arbitrary exceptions.
UNPREDICTABLE results or operations have several implementation=20
restrictions:
=E2=80=A2 Implementations of operations generating UNPREDICTABLE results mu=
st=20
not depend on any data source (memory or internal state) which is=20
inaccessible in the current processor mode
=E2=80=A2 UNPREDICTABLE operations must not read, write, or modify the cont=
ents=20
of memory or internal state which is inaccessible in the current=20
processor mode. For example, UNPREDICTABLE operations executed in user=20
mode must not access memory or internal state that is only accessible in=20
Kernel Mode or Debug Mode or in another process
=E2=80=A2 UNPREDICTABLE operations must not halt or hang the processor

1.2.2  UNDEFINED
UNDEFINED operations or behavior may vary from processor implementation=20
to implementation, instruction to instruction, or as a function of time=20
on the same implementation or instruction. UNDEFINED operations or=20
behavior may vary from nothing to creating an environment in which=20
execution can no longer continue. UNDEFINED operations or behavior may=20
cause data loss.
UNDEFINED operations or behavior has one implementation restriction:
=E2=80=A2 UNDEFINED operations or behavior must not cause the processor to =
hang=20
(that is, enter a state from which there is no exit other than powering=20
down the processor). The assertion of any of the reset signals must=20
restore the processorto an operational state

Then:

Jump and Link Register (JALR)

Processor operation is UNPREDICTABLE if a branch, jump, ERET, DERET, or=20
WAIT instruction is placed in the delay slot of a branch or jump.

On Vol I Rev 6.01:

5.3.2.1  Control Transfer Instructions in Delay Slots and Forbidden Slots

In MIPS architectures prior to Release 6. if a control transfer=20
instruction (CTI) is placed in a branch delay slot, the operation of=20
both instructions is UNPREDICTABLE. In Release 6, if a CTI is placed in=20
a branch delay slot or a compact branch forbidden slot, implementations=20
are required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception.

The following instructions are forbidden in branch delay slots and=20
forbidden slots: any CTI, including branches and jumps, ERET, ERETNC,=20
DERET, WAIT, and PAUSE. Their occurrence is required to signal a=20
Reserved Instruction exception.

5.3.2.2  Exceptions and Delay and Forbidden Slots

If an exception or interrupt prevents the completion of an instruction=20
in a delay slot or forbidden slot, the hardware reports an Exception PC=20
(CP0 EPC) of the branch, with a status bit set (StatusBD) to indicate=20
that the exception was for the instruction in the delay slot of the branch.
By convention, if an exception or interrupt prevents the completion of=20
an instruction in a branch delay or forbidden slot, the branch=20
instruction is re-executed and branch instructions must be restartable=20
to permit this. In particular, procedure calls must be restartable. To=20
insure that a procedure call is restartable, procedure calls that have a=20
delay slot or forbidden slot (branch/jump-and-link instructions) should=20
not use the register in which the return link is stored (usu-ally GPR=20
31) as a source register. This applies to all branch/jump-and-link=20
instructions that have both a slot (delay or forbidden) and source=20
registers, both for conditions (e.g., BGEZAL or BGEZALC) or for jump=20
targets (JALR).

I would have expected the behavior match the UNDEFINED description, as=20
Yongbok Kim commented here:

   branches in a delay slot is "undefined" in the pre-Release
   6 architecture. MIPS architectre release 6 defines to signal
   Reserved Instruction exceptions for such cases.

But it really appears as UNPREDICTABLE.
