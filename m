The "personality" thing is a largely unused facility that
a process can use to say it has this generic behaviour.
In this case we say we have the PER_LINUX32 personality
so it will make the process evoke 32bit behaviours inside
the kernel when dealing with this process.

Which I (loosely) appreciate that we want to achieve.

It's not a POSIX thing (not part of the Single Unix Specification)
so as with most Linux things it has some fuzzy semantics
defined by the community...

I usually just go to the source.

If you grep the kernel what turns up is a bunch of
architecture-specific behaviors on arm64, ia64, mips, parisc,
powerpc, s390, sparc. They are very minor.

On x86_64 the semantic effect is
none so this would work for any kind of 32bit userspace
on x86_64. It would be the first time this flag has any
effect at all on x86_64, but arguably a useful one.

I would not be surprised if running say i586 on x86_64
has the same problem, just that noone has reported
it yet. But what do I know. If they have the same problem
they can use the same solution. Hm QEMU supports
emulating i586 or even i386 ... maybe you could test?
Or tell me how to test? We might be solving a bigger
issue here.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
