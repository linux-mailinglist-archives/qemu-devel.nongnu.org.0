Note that anything originating at the client (i.e. starting with "")
will get caught by the first rule and be prefixed with 'user.virtiofs.'
This second rule will only be triggered by an xattr name coming
from the server (i.e a listxattr) for a name that doesn't begin
with user.virtiofs. (i.e. didn't match the 1st rule for a server xattr).
This makes sure that only guest created xattr's (that were set and
had a prefix added) are then visible to the guest.

All of them; they're still matched at the beginning; as the first
patch says 'It maybe empty in which case a 'client' rule will always
match on client names'

prefixed not replaced; so it'll turn "trusted." into
"user.virtiofs.trusted." and strip it back off for listxattr.

No, the first rule will only prefix strings provided by the guest
and strip strings provided by the server. This rule hides
existing server 'trusted.' xattrs - so if the guest sets
trusted.foo it's not confused by also seeing a server trusted.foo

Right; and that's dangerous, because a non-privileged guest
process can set a user. xattr; so a non-priv guest process could
set user.virtiofs.trusted.foo and then it would get read back
and be used as trusted.foo that has an impact on priviliged processes.
