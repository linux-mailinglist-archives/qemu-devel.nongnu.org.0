Yes.  Mistakes happen.  Integration tests can catch them.  Perfection is
impossible there as well, though.

Yes.

No argument.  The question is how.  I'm working on making it easier to
do and easier to consume for QAPI interfaces, i.e. most of QMP.

Command line isn't really introspectable (see my KVM Forum 2017 talk).

That said, the list of devices *is* introspectable with QMP:

    {"execute": "qom-list-types",
     "arguments": {"implements": "device", "abstract": false}}

I'm not sure what exactly goes wrong in RHBZ 1745868.
