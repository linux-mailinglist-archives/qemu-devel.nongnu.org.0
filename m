I can confirm that this bug has been fixed (zapped). Thank you all for
your hard work and determination. A job well done indeed! As a former
programmer I love you all's zeal for attacking this bug.

As a side note, knowing what you all go through, I always look things
up, walk through at least level 1 stuff and provide logfiles. I hope
what little I did, help you all resolve this.

Again my thanks, and I believe is this is where we say, "Please close
the bug marked SOLVED".

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
