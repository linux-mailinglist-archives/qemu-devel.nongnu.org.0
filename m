It might break the assumption from device drivers that mapping a page is
safe. For example they call alloc_page() followed by dma_map_page(). In
our situation dma-iommu.c will oblige and create one 64k mapping to one 4k
physical page. As a result the endpoint can access the neighbouring 60k of
memory.

This isn't too terrible. After all, even when the page sizes match, device
drivers can call dma_map_single() on sub-page buffers, which will also let
the endpoint access a whole page. The solution, if you don't trust the
endpoint, is to use bounce buffers.

But I suspect it's not as simple as removing the BUG_ON(), we'll need to
go over dma-iommu.c first. And it seems like assigning endpoints to guest
userspace won't work either in this config. In vfio_dma_do_map():

        mask = ((uint64_t)1 << __ffs(vfio_pgsize_bitmap(iommu))) - 1;

        WARN_ON(mask & PAGE_MASK);

If I read this correctly the WARN will trigger in a 4k guest under 64k
host, right?  So maybe we can just say that this config isn't supported,
unless it's an important use-case for virtio-iommu?

Thanks,
Jean
