Not sure where in this thread to reply, but since my name is mentioned
in this mail, it might at least be not the worst one.

I think this really makes sense. Or at least have a blacklist of OSes
that we can't support iotests on, which would contain at least Windows
and OS X. Windows because I'm pretty sure that it doesn't work anyway,
and OS X because if something fails there, we have no way to reproduce.
The occasional build failures on OS X that must be fixed by blindly
guessing what could work without any way to test the fix are already bad
enough.

I disagree. It happened all the time that someone else broke the iotests
in master and we needed to fix it up.

I think I may have implicitly consented by helping Alex with the changes
to 'check' that made its output fit better in 'make check'.

Basically, my stance is that I share your dislike for the effects on me
personally (also, I can't run 'make check' any more before a pull
request without testing half of the iotests twice because I still need a
full iotests run), but I also think that having iotests in 'make check'
is really the right thing for the project despite the inconvenience it
means for me.

That's something that can be fixed by tweaking the auto group.

Can we run tests in 'auto' that require the system emulator? If so,
let's add 030 040 041 to the default set. They take long, but they are
among the most valuable tests we have. If this makes the tests take too
much time, let's remove some less important ones instead.

I messed up, so this pull request was rightly stopped. I consider this
one a feature, not a bug.
