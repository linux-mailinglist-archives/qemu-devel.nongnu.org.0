Public bug reported:

When creating a disk using qemu-img create command, if the destination
path of the qcow2 file already exists, it will show the error saying
that it cannot get a lock so it exits with exit status 1 but it will
corrupt the qcow2 file anyway.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a guest running with a root (vda) and a second device (vdc).
In my case is a clean Ubuntu 16.04 image with kernel 4.4.0-190-generic x86_=
64
vdc disk is called testadddisk-3.qcow2
2. vdc is an xfs over lvm.
pvcreacte /dev/vdc
vgcreate myVg /dev/vdc
lvcreate -l+100%FREE -n myLv myVg
mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/myVg-myLv
mount /dev/mapper/myVg-myLv /mnt
3. Create disk IO on that device in the guest.
while true ; do dd if=3D/dev/zero of=3D/mnt/testfile bs=3D1024 count=3D1000=
 ; sleep 1; done
4. Execute the command to create a new device but use the same name of the =
device attached:
sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 testadddisk-3.qcow2 20G
The output of the command is this:
Formatting 'testadddisk-3.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D21474836480 cluster_si=
ze=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcount_bits=3D16
qemu-img: testadddisk-3.qcow2: Failed to get "write" lock
Is another process using the image?

The write continues in the guest but when it is shutdown, when it is powere=
d on again you get this:
error: Failed to start domain testadddisk
error: internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: 2020-10-=
27T22:00:51.628374Z qemu-system-x86_64: -drive file=3D/var/lib/vmImages/tes=
tadddisk-3.qcow2,format=3Dqcow2,if=3Dnone,id=3Ddrive-virtio-disk2: Image is=
 not in qcow2 format

I run the qemu-img create command with an strace and I believe that
first it tries to open the file in write mode, then does a truncate on
it and after that says it cannot get a lock. The output is in the file
attached. As well as the guest xml just in case.
