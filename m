Hi,

The cover letter from v1 (explaining the motivation behind this series
and the general structure) is here:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-09/msg01323.html


For v2, I=E2=80=99ve tried to address Maxim=E2=80=99s comments:
- Patch 1 through 3: New
- Patch 4: Only print feature bits instead of blacklisting stuff that we
           don=E2=80=99t need
- Patch 5:
  - Fix typo
  - Add comment why 098 needs compat=3D1.1
- Patch 16: Use _check_test_img
- Patch 17: Use the new _filter_json_filename
- Patch 18: Rethink the incompatible feature filter approach: Instead of
            filtering out the data_file bit, just check whether the
            dirty bit is present (because that is all we want to know)
- Patch 19: Use the new _filter_json_filename
- Patch 20: Rebase conflicts due to the changes to patch 5
- Patch 21:
  - Add and use _get_data_file
  - Add a comment how the data_file_filter in _filter_qemu_img_map works
