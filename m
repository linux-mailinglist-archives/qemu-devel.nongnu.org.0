The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  qemu-nbd causes data corruption in VDI-format disk images

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  This is a duplicate of #1422307.  I can't figure out a way to re-open
  it--the status of "Fix Released" is changeable only by a project
  maintainer or bug supervisor--so I'm opening a new bug to make sure
  this gets looked at again.

  qemu-nbd will sometimes corrupt VDI disk images.  The bug was thought
  to be fixed in commit f0ab6f109630940146cbaf47d0cd99993ddba824, but
  I'm able to reproduce it in both that commit and in the latest commit
  (a951316b8a5c3c63254f20a826afeed940dd4cba).  I just needed to run more
  iterations of the test.  It's possible that it was partially fixed, or
  that the added serialization made it harder to catch this
  non-deterministic bug, but the same symptoms persist: data corruption
  of VDI-format disk images.

  This affects at least qemu-nbd.  I haven't tried reproducing the issue
  with qemu proper or qemu-img, but the original bug report suggests
  that the bug in the common VDI backend may corrupt data written by
  those programs.

  Please let me know if I can provide any further information or help
  with testing.  Thank you very much for looking into this!

  Test procedure
  **************

  The procedure used is the one given by Max Reitz (xanclic) in the
  original bug report, comment 3
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1422307/comments/3), in the
  section "VDI and NBD over /dev/nbd0", but with up to 1000 iterations
  instead of 10:

    $ cd ~/qemu-origfix-f0ab6f1/bin
    $ dd if=3D/dev/urandom of=3Dblob.raw bs=3D1M count=3D64
    64+0 records in
    64+0 records out
    67108864 bytes (67 MB) copied, 4.36475 s, 15.4 MB/s
    $ sudo sh -c 'for i in $(seq 0 999); do ./qemu-img create -f vdi test.v=
di 64M > /dev/null; ./qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 test.vdi; sleep 1; ./qemu-img c=
onvert -n blob.raw /dev/nbd0; ./qemu-img convert /dev/nbd0 test1.raw; sync;=
 echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; ./qemu-img convert /dev/nbd0 test2.raw;=
 ./qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0 > /dev/null; if ! ./qemu-img compare -q test1.raw =
test2.raw; then md5sum test1.raw test2.raw; echo "$i failed"; break; fi; do=
ne; echo "done"'
  27a66c3a8ac2cf06f2c925968ea9e964  test1.raw
  2da9bf169041a7c2bd144c4ab3a29aea  test2.raw
  64 failed
  done

  I've run this process a handful of times, and I've seen it take as
  little as 10 iterations and as many as 161 (taking 32 minutes in the
  latter case).  Please be patient.  Putting the images on tmpfs will
  probably help it go faster, and I have successfully reproduced the
  issue on tmpfs in addition to ext4.

  Nothing different was needed to reproduce the issue in a directory
  containing a build of the latest commit.  It still takes somewhere
  around 1-200 iterations to find, in my testing.

  Build procedure
  ***************

    $ git clone git://git.qemu-project.org/qemu.git
    [omitted]
    $ git clone qemu qemu-origfix-f0ab6f1
    Cloning into 'qemu-origfix-f0ab6f1'...
    done.
    $ cd qemu-origfix-f0ab6f1
    $ git checkout f0ab6f109630940146cbaf47d0cd99993ddba824
    Note: checking out 'f0ab6f109630940146cbaf47d0cd99993ddba824'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in th=
is
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
    =

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Examp=

  Nothing different was done when building the latest commit (besides
  cloning to a different directory, and not running `git checkout`).

  Environment

    * Hypervisor: Xen 4.4 (Debian package xen-hypervisor-4.4-amd64,
      version 4.4.1-9+deb8u8)
    =

    * A Xen domU (guest) for building QEMU and reproducing the issue.
      All testing was done within the virtual machine for convenience
      and access to better hardware than what I have for my development
      machine (I expected the build to take much longer than it really
      does).
