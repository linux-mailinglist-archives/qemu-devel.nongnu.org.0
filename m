Holding the AioContext lock should be enough for this.

But note that it doesn't make a difference if new requests are actually
incoming. The timing of the QMP command to start a backup job versus the
timing of guest requests is essentially random. QEMU doesn't know what
guest requests you mean to be included in the backup and which you don't
unless you stop sending new requests well ahead of time.

If you send a QMP request to start a backup, the backup will be
consistent for some arbitrary point in time between the time that you
sent the QMP request and the time that you received the reply to it.

Draining in the QMP command handler wouldn't change any of this, because
even the drain section starts at some arbitrary point in time.

If I understand correctly, fsfreeze only returns success after it has
made sure that the guest has quiesced the device. So at any point
between receiving the successful return of the fsfreeze and calling
fsthaw, the state should be consistent.

Here, draining is actually important because you don't synchronise
against something external that you don't control anyway, but you just
make sure that you start the backup of all disks at the same point in
time (which is still an arbitrary point between the time that you send
the transaction QMP command and the time that you receive success), even
if no fsfreeze/fsthaw was used.
