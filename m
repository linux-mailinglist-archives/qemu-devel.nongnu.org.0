No, we don't have any iotests for migration with filter drivers yet. We
probably should, but I didn't want to miss -rc3 with the fix because I
was busy writing a test case.

The old code didn't actually do anything that should have a different
result (apart from WRITE_UNCHANGED for inactive images), just everything
in a more complicated way for no apparent reason. Or at least that's
what Max and I concluded after looking at this.

Taking the PERM_UNCHANGED bits from the old value effectively means that
they are taken from the very first call, which had c =3D=3D NULL. So we can
just use the same code to set them instead of referring to the old
values of c->perm and c->shared_perm (which is really something a
=2Ebdrv_child_perm implementation shouldn't do - there are more cases, but
we can clean them up for 4.2).

Not cleaning this up would mean that I'd have to explicitly clear the
WRITE_UNCHANGED bit after uselessly copying from the old state. This
would be further complication of already unnecessarily complicated code,
so I decided that cleaning it up so that its correctness becomes very
obvious (request everything the parent nodes need, plus WRITE_UNCHANGED
for the copy on read functionality if the node is active) makes more
sense.
