Sure, but if we decide that certain number(N) of vcpus are hotplugabble
and certain subset of N (say 'n' < 'N') should be allowed to be present
or cold-plugged at the init time then I wonder which of the following
is correct approach:

1. Bring all of N vcpus at boot time under "peripheral" container
                                   OR
2. Just bring subset 'n' of 'N' under "peripheral" container and rest
    under "unattached" container? And later as and when rest of the
    vcpus are hotplugged they should be transferred from "unattached"
    container to "peripheral" container?

Sure.

Sure, what if hotplugged device is removed and then added again? It looks=20
qmp_device_add() interface will again end up calling the device_set_realize=
d()
which eventually would put hotplugged devices under "unattached" container?

Any examples on top of your head where such an interface might be of use?


Many thanks
