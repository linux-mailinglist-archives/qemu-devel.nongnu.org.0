I really think we should be a bit more cautious of commiting to an
on-disk format for the persistent state. Both this and Klaus' persistent
state feels a bit ad-hoc, and with all the other knobs provided, it
looks too easy to have out-of-sync states, or just not being able to
boot at all if a qemu versions have different on-disk formats.

Is anyone really considering zone emulation for production level stuff
anyway? I can't imagine a real scenario where you'd want put yourself
through that: you are just giving yourself all the downsides of a zoned
block device and none of the benefits. AFAIK, this is provided as a
development vehicle, closer to a "toy".

I think we should consider trimming this down to a more minimal set that
we *do* agree on and commit for inclusion ASAP. We can iterate all the
bells & whistles and flush out the meta data's data marshalling scheme
for persistence later.
