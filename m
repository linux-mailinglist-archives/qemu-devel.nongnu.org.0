I have tried something a bit more ambitious at

https://github.com/hw-claudio/qemu.git branch: "cpus-interface"

starting to look nice, with each single accelerator registering an interface to cpus.c,
so that the cpu thread can reside within that specific accelerator.

Some workarounds are eliminated as a result as well, for example for the kick.
Removes some windows special casing (note: while doing this I noticed that windows has been bolted in initially for HAX, so there might be some assumptions there that became wrong with the addition of whpx.

In particular, the DUMMY_APC thing. Left the "bug" there, but added a comment so it can be discussed.

The most difficult part is to split the patch: everything is so knit together that "doing one accel at a time" for example is really challenging.

Will try to post what I have and then I will be looking for feedback on how to split it if necessary for easier reviewing, but already some comments on the approach could be valuable..

Ciao,

C
