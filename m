So the confusing thing here is that there are spapr machine caps, and
those are separate from the KVM caps for the VM.  Then the KVM caps
also have whether the cap is possible and whether it is current
activated.

The spapr machine caps *must* remain static for the VM's lifetime and
only cover possibilities, not runtime configuration.  KVM caps may be
activated as necessary.

So you can leave activating the KVM cap until nmi-register.  But if
the spapr cap is disabled you must prohibit nmi-register.

The apply() functions are responsible for checking if the spapr caps
are possible on the KVM implementation.  So if cap_fwnmi_mci_apply()
is called with val=3D=3D1 and KVM doesn't support the fwnmi extensions, it
must fail outright.

I'm not sure what you mean by "the host" here.

Enabling the spapr cap?  It is set based on the command line and
machine type, just like on the source machine.

Probably, but I'm not sure exactly what.

The val argument to apply() is set to the value of the spapr cap.
This is based on the qemu command line and machine type, and must be
the same on source and destination.  As a general rule, qemu requires
that the same machine options are used on source and destination.
