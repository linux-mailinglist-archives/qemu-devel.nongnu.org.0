Hm, yes. I took the description from the tools. I can switch to the vl.c
one (should the tools, too?).

But honestly, neither of the two is enough to tell anyone how to
actually use this... Considering how many different objects there are,
maybe the best we can do is referring to the man page for details.

I tried to reuse that code from qemu_opts_parse_noisily(), until I
realised that it wasn't even used for -object.

I don't remember the details why qemu_opts_print_help() wasn't even
called, but it's obvious that we can't lose anything from it:
qemu_object_opts has an empty list of properties, it accepts anything.
QemuOpts can't print any useful help when this is all the information it
has.

Thanks for catching this. (You don't even need the ",help" part, just
--object wrong=3D1 is enough.)

Hm, yes. Weird interface, no caller actually needs this reference.

On IRC, we discussed last week that we could turn object-add into a
'gen': false command and accept things both as options in props and as
flat options on the top level.

However, looking at this again, I'm afraid we forgot the context while
discussing specifics: How would this be used in a command line parser?

We don't start with a QDict here, but with a string. Getting a QDict
that could serve as an input to a modified qmp_object_add() would still
involve going through QemuOpts for parsing the option string, and then
converting it to a QDict. Using a visitor isn't possible with '*props':
'any' and even less so with 'gen': false.

So would this really improve things? Or do we have to wait until we have
an actual schema for object-add before calling qmp_object_add() actually
makes sense?
