I think the only chance of confusion is poor documentation.  If we
define all of the above as invalid and then say any invalid state
indicates an error condition, then the burden is on the user to
enumerate all the invalid states.  That's not a good idea.  Instead we
could say 101b (_RESUMING|_RUNNING) is reserved, it's not currently
used but it might be useful some day.  Therefore there are no valid
transitions into or out of this state.  A vendor driver should fail a
write(2) attempting to enter this state.

That leaves 11Xb, where we consider _RESUMING and _SAVING as mutually
exclusive, so neither are likely to ever be valid states.  Logically,
if the device is in a failed state such that it needs to be reset to be
recovered, I would hope the device is not running, so !_RUNNING (110b)
seems appropriate.  I'm not sure we need that level of detail yet
though, so I was actually just assuming both 11Xb states would indicate
an error state and the undefined _RUNNING bit might differentiate
something in the future.

Therefore, I think we'd have:

 * 101b => Reserved
 * 11Xb => Error

Where the device can only self transition into the Error state on a
failed device_state transition and the only exit from the Error state
is via the reset ioctl.  The Reserved state is unreachable.  The vendor
driver must error on device_state writes to enter or exit the Error
state and must error on writes to enter Reserved states.  Is that still
confusing?

I just don't see that it adds any value to use a separate bit, we
already have more error states than we need with the 3 bits we have.
Thanks,

Alex
