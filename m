Debian and Fedora both have good project hygiene for tracking sources
for their binary packages and extensive archives which we can work with.
These other projects seem to be more of a moving feast which I think is
proving we can't rely on them as a CI test and at best best efforts for
developer testing.

It seems Armbian do document their build process but it's not quite as
easy as just downloading the source deb.

I've pondered this before and while it might have a place for random
weird machines with no mainline distro support it's not a path I'm keen
to go down. This goes especially for some of the more esoteric ARM
hardware where you start relying on hacked up vendor trees with very
specific toolchain requirements.
