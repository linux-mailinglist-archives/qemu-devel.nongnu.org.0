Because we don't support either compression or xbzrle with postcopy.
Compression could be fixed, but it needs to make sure it uses the
place-page function to atomically place the page.

xbzrle never gets used during the postcopy stage; it gets used
in the precopy stage in a migration that might switch to postcopy
though.  Since xbzrle relies on optimising differences between
passes, it's
   1) Not needed in postcopy where there's only one final pass
   2) Since the destination is changing RAM, you can't transmit
      deltas relative to the old data, since that data may have
      changed.
