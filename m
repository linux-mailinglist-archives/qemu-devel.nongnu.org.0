I don=E2=80=99t quite see why we couldn=E2=80=99t add such filters before=
 or after
migration.  And it was my impression that bitmap migration was a problem
now precisely because it is bound to the graph structure.

But anyway.  I=E2=80=99ll gladly remove myself from this discussion becau=
se I
don=E2=80=99t know much about migration and actually I=E2=80=99d prefer t=
o keep it that
way.  (Sorry.)
