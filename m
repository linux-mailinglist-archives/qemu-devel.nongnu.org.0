Then we come to Windows and macOS.

What I=E2=80=99ve proposed to John on IRC was to simply skip the iotests =

Obviously, because as I=E2=80=99ve said it doesn=E2=80=99t affect any tes=

It isn=E2=80=99t when the solution is to just reduce the coverage again.

Furthermore, the problem is that we get this additional coverage on

It usually worked fine for me because it=E2=80=99s rather rare that non-b=
lock
patches broke the iotests.

I have to admit I actually didn=E2=80=99t think of other people wanting t=
o run
the iotests; but to be honest, your mail doesn=E2=80=99t sound like you w=
ant to
run the iotests either.  It rather sounds like you have to because
otherwise I might complain.

(The reason I didn=E2=80=99t think of it is because non-block patches rar=
ely
break them, so I wouldn=E2=80=99t run the iotests if I were a non-block
maintainer.  Sorry.)


Part of my problem is precisely with the fact that different systems are
different and that the iotests are not as deterministic as we=E2=80=99d w=
ant
them to be.  Realistically, I don=E2=80=99t think they=E2=80=99ll ever be=
=2E  I know they
haven=E2=80=99t been for six years even though it=E2=80=99s been kind of =
a goal, but it
hasn=E2=80=99t worked out so far.  (I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s po=
ssible to write iotests
in a way that they are provably deterministic.)

So now you run the tests on your machine, they pass, you send a pull
request.  On Peter=E2=80=99s test machines, they pass, too, so the reques=
t is
merged.  But then on someone else=E2=80=99s machine, they don=E2=80=99t, =
so they get a
make check failure, which is just one step below build failure.  (Or
maybe it just turns up later on the test machines, because it=E2=80=99s f=
lakey.
 Like in the case of 130 a week ago, which I CC=E2=80=99d you on.)

And then it=E2=80=99s my problem even though there=E2=80=99s most likely =
no real problem
there.  (And I can=E2=80=99t reproduce it, because, well, I have a differ=
ent setup.)


Maybe my main problem is that I feel like now I have to deal with all of
the fallout, even though adding the iotests to make check wasn=E2=80=99t =
my idea
and neither me nor Kevin ever consented.  (I don=E2=80=99t know whether K=
evin
consented implicitly, but I don=E2=80=99t see his name in bdd95e47844f2d8=
b.)

You can=E2=80=99t just give me more responsibility without my consent and=
 then
call me egoistic for not liking it.

Well, that=E2=80=99s how it=E2=80=99s always worked, and that didn=E2=80=99=
t frustrate me.

Also, to give you a bit more perspective on why the situation has just
worsed for me, it=E2=80=99s because I run many more tests than what we ha=
ve in
auto for qcow2.  I=E2=80=99ve rarely had a problem with that very limited=
 set of
tests, but with others.  Mostly NBD, actually.

(I run qcow2, qcow2 -o compat=3D0.10, qcow2 -o refcount_bits=3D1, nbd, ra=
w,
luks, qcow, qed, cloop, parallels, bochs, vdi, vhdx, vmdk, vpc; only
x64, but at least both -m64 and -m32.)

First, a disclaimer.  I=E2=80=99m aware that I may be very wrong about th=
e
following, because I will not see make check failures on other people=E2=80=
=99s
systems that they fix themselves.  But the thing is, you haven=E2=80=99t =
told me
about any such failures on your system so far, so I=E2=80=99m just going =
to give
you my perspective here.

Honestly, it looks to me like you don=E2=80=99t even want to run the iote=
sts.  I
interpret most of what you=E2=80=99ve written as:

- I don=E2=80=99t want to not run the iotests, because then people will h=
it me
  for making them fail.

- But they fail all the time, so I always need a baseline for what is
  expected to sometimes fail and what isn=E2=80=99t.  That=E2=80=99s very=
 annoying.
  Let=E2=80=99s introduce a baseline in the form of auto/qcow2, and then =
let
  everyone verify that it works.

So to me it looks like we=E2=80=99ve just added all tests that never fail=
 to
auto.  But if they never fail, then it=E2=80=99s like we haven=E2=80=99t =
run the tests
at all.  (As I=E2=80=99ve said, you need to tell me whether they do fail,=

because I don=E2=80=99t see them fail[1].)

So honestly (I know this is unfair, but it=E2=80=99s my honest POV) it lo=
oks to
me like the current situation is just an excuse for everyone to be able
to claim they run the iotests.  When actually, they don=E2=80=99t, becaus=
e they
run only a small well-defined set that doesn=E2=80=99t catch much anyway.=
  (What
they do catch is stuff that doesn=E2=80=99t help.)

I know you=E2=80=99ll say that we just need to ensure we can add more tes=
ts,
then.  But for one thing, the most important tests are the ones that
take the longest, like 041.  And the other of course is that adding any
more tests to make check just brings me more pain, so I won=E2=80=99t do =
it.

[1] There is the recent case of Kevin=E2=80=99s pull request having been
rejected because his test failed on anything but x64.  I=E2=80=99m torn h=
ere,
because I would have seen that failure on my -m32 build.  So it isn=E2=80=
=99t
like it would have evaded our view for long.

But OTOH, yes, this is a failure that could have annoyed quite some
people for a week; and now it has indeed been caught by make check.

=46rom what I read you yourself argued that that doesn=E2=80=99t mean muc=
h,
though, because everyone has different setups on their machine.

Me too, that=E2=80=99s the point.


Overall, I think my main problem is that I feel like you=E2=80=99re leavi=
ng me
alone here.  It=E2=80=99s unfair to just add the iotests to make check wi=
thout
my consent, then let me deal with the problems, and then call me
egoistic when I complain.

You have to decide: Either let me deal with the problems, but then I
have every right to be egoistic about it =E2=80=93 or you help me deal wi=
th them.
