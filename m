Hi Klaus,

Thx for your feedback!
I don't think it matters if MSIX table is in prefetchable vs 
non-prefetchable memory. 
My understanding is that spec allows MSIX and PBA to be in any BAR and
offset. I understand your preference and at the same time think that
since it is not in violation of the spec why don't we leave it as-is?
Does anybody know what's typical approach for real devices?

Yep will reabse it.

Correct. That's what I implied here w/o actual verbiage. I can extend it
to add that information.

I don't understand that comment. Could you please explain more?
