Hello,

I thought that the not fully working problem on my laptop was originated
by the es keymap file, but it is not. I have edited that file and I
receive the same error. I believe that windows version of qemu has a
problem, at least, with laptops. A few months ago I get this error with
an asus laptop and nowdays I am even worse with a hp. I can not test the
windows version with a desktop computer.

I will download every new version and I shall comment if it works.

Thanks for your attention.


** Summary changed:

- Spanish keyboard from Spain (Europe) not found
+ Keyboard not fully working on Windows version

Title:
  Keyboard not fully working on Windows version

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello,

  I am working with windows qemu version:

  qemu-w64-setup-20190815

  I have installed a msdos virtual machine on qemu with sp keyboard
  layout (Spain at Europe). I have found that some keys do not work in
  the way they should. I believe that the problem is that es qemu
  spanish keyboard layout is the latin one, la in msdos sysytem.

  I ask you to create the Spain layout.


  Thanks in advance.
