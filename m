The error is because the gdb you have installed doesn't understand
foreign architectures. The test should have skipped in this case so I',
not sure why it causes it to fail.

You can either ensure you have multiarch capable gdb (this is
binutils-multiarch on debian for example) or build your own gdb and
point at it with --gdb in configure.
