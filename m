x86 developers could easily add this feature if/when they need a way to
disable their current default behavior. But, since the kvm-adjvtime
default would likely be 'on' for them, then they'd probably prefer the
feature be named kvm-no-adjvtime, and default 'off'. Should we try to
anticipate what x86 might want when naming this feature? IMO, we should
not, especially because I'm doubtful that x86 will ever want to implement
it. Also, what about the other KVM capable architectures? Which defaults
do they have now? And do we expect them to want to expose a switch to the
user to change it?

OTOH, I agree with Andrea that it would be nice if arm had the same
default as x86, allowing the documentation regarding this stuff to apply
to both. If we did choose to turn this feature on by default for virt-5.0,
then maybe we should introduce the feature with the name kvm-no-adjvtime
instead.
