This patch documents the steps to use virtio pmem.
It also documents other useful information about
virtio pmem e.g use-case, comparison with Qemu NVDIMM
backend and current limitations.

+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+ This document explains the setup and usage of virtio pmem device
+ which is available since QEMU v4.1.0.
+
+ The virtio pmem is a paravirtualized persistent memory device on
+ regular(i.e non-NVDIMM) storage.
+
+Usecase
+--------
+
+  Allows to bypass the guest page cache and directly use host page cache=
.
+  This reduces guest memory footprint as the host can make efficient
+  memory reclaim decisions under memory pressure.
+
+o How does virtio-pmem compare to the nvdimm emulation supported by QEMU=
?
+
+  NVDIMM emulation on regular(i.e. non-NVDIMM) host storage does not
+  persist the guest writes as there are no defined semantics in the devi=
ce
+  specification. The virtio pmem device provides guest write persistence
+  on non-NVDIMM host storage.
+
+virtio pmem usage
+-----------------
+
+  A virtio pmem device backed by a memory-backend-file can be created on
+  the QEMU command line as in the following example:
+
+  -object memory-backend-file,id=3Dmem1,share,mem-path=3D./virtio_pmem.i=
mg,size=3D4G
+  -device virtio-pmem-pci,memdev=3Dmem1,id=3Dnv1
+
+   where:
+   - "object memory-backend-file,id=3Dmem1,share,mem-path=3D<image>, siz=
e=3D<image size>"
+     creates a backend file of size on a mem-path.
+
+   - "device virtio-pmem-pci,id=3Dnvdimm1,memdev=3Dmem1" creates a virti=
o pmem
+     pci device whose storage is provided by above memory backend device=
.
+
+  Multiple virtio pmem devices can be created if multiple pairs of "-obj=
ect"
+  and "-device" are provided.
+
+Hotplug
+-------
+
+"Virtio pmem devices can be hotplugged via the QEMU monitor. First, the
+memory backing has to be added via 'object_add'; afterwards, the virtio
+pmem device can be added via 'device_add'."
+
+For example, the following commands add another 4GB virtio pmem device t=
o
+the guest:
+
+ (qemu) object_add memory-backend-file,id=3Dmem2,share=3Don,mem-path=3Dv=
irtio_pmem2.img,size=3D4G
+ (qemu) device_add virtio-pmem-pci,id=3Dvirtio_pmem2,memdev=3Dmem2
+
+Guest Data Persistence
+----------------------
+
+ Guest data persistence on non-NVDIMM requires guest userspace applicati=
on to
+ perform fsync/msync. This is different from a real nvdimm backend where=
 no
+ additional fsync/msync is required. This is to persist guest writes in =
host
+ backing file which otherwise remains in host page cache and there is ri=
sk of
+ losing the data in case of power failure.
+
+ With virtio pmem device, MAP_SYNC mmap flag is not supported. This prov=
ides
+ a hint to application to perform fsync for write persistence.
+
+Limitations
+------------
+- Real nvdimm device backend is not supported.
+- virtio pmem hotunplug is not supported.
+- ACPI NVDIMM features like regions/namespaces are not supported.
+- ndctl command is not supported.
