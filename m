FWIW, I have rebuilt the bios for the stable tree in the past, when a
bios patch had been picked. In this case, however, I would need to rely
on someone else to sanity-check the binary.

How likely are folks to run -stable QEMU with a bootmap containing
signatures? It would be one more QEMU version with toleration for this,
but I expect distros to pick up this one anyway?
