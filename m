The most logical thing to do would be to have userspace handle all
calls, but add an ioctl to forward a call to KVM.  This puts userspace
in charge of the SMCCC interface, with KVM handling only those things
that userspace can't do for itself, on request.

If the performance overhead is unacceptable for certain calls, we could
have a way to delegate specific function IDs to KVM.  I suspect that
will be the exception rather than the rule.

Agreed: the set of calls not handled by KVM will mutate over time.
