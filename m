Hi Mark,

Thank you for reporting this bug. I was away from office for couple of 
days, so that's why I am answering you a bit late, sorry about that. I 
will start working on a solution and try to fix this problem in next 
couple of days.

I agree with you. This will be changed in upcoming patch.

"sh" is taken from the ISA documentation, so I would leave that as it is 
now, but I can change some other variable names to be consistent with 
previous implementation (e.g. "shifted" -> "carry").

I don't think that we should check each byte of VRB, because we care 
only about "defined" behavior. If shift values doesn't match, result is 
"undefined" so it doesn't matter what is inside resulting register.

This will be removed in upcoming patch.
