Great, packaging the QEMUMachine and QMP classes would be a useful first
step. These are probably the packages that most users want. It might
even be useful to add libvirt support to the QMP class so that scripts
can either use QEMU directly or libvirt.

A little bit of cleanup may be required, I haven't checked the state of
the code.
