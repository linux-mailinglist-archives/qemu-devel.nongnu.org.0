With QTest, is this still a concern, since there are no CPU instructions
involved? Sometimes the fork-server starts after some I/O has already
occured (eg mapping BARs and setting up VQs for virtio-net). I know we
briefly talked about threads at some point, and it seems that iothreads
may be a concern, if any are started before fork. Other than that, since
there is no TCG/CPU thread, are there any other threads that could be
a concern?
