Right; the migration format can't ignore chunks of data; so it does need
to know somehow; the choice is either a capability or wiring it to the
machine type;  my preference is to wire it to the machine type; the
arguments are:
    a) Machine type
       Pro: libvirt doesn't need to do anything
       Con: It doesn't protect old machine types
            It's not really part of the guest state

    b) Capability
       Pro: Works on all machine types
       Con: Libvirt needs to enable it

So, no strong preference but I think I prefer (a).
