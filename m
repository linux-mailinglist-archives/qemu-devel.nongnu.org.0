The method was introduced relatively recently (recent in glib terms,
this was still 2013).

commit a6a87506877939fee54bdc7eca70d47fc7d893d4
Author: Matthias Clasen <mclasen@redhat.com>
Date:   Sat Aug 17 15:18:29 2013 -0400

    Add a way to make assertions non-fatal
    
    When using test harnesses other than gtester (e.g. using TAP),
    it can be suboptimal to have the very first failed assertion
    abort the test suite.
    
    This commit adds a g_test_set_nonfatal_assertions() that can
    be called in a test binary to change the behaviour of most
    assert macros to just call g_test_fail() and continue. We
    don't change the behavior of g_assert() and g_assert_not_reached(),
    since these to assertion macros are older than GTest, are
    widely used outside of testsuites, and will cause compiler
    warnings if they loose their noreturn annotation.
    
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692125


This makes sense as a rationale so I'm surprised that they
never then used it in glib tests.

Daniel
