Hi Daniel,

We're already using the shared x86 runners, but with a different goal.  The
goal of the "Gating CI" is indeed to expand on non-x86 environments.  We're
in a "chicken and egg" kind of situation, because we'd like to prove that
GitLab CI will allow QEMU to expand to very different runners and jobs, whi=
le
not really having all that hardware setup and publicly available at this ti=
me.

My experiments were really around that point, I mean, confirming that we ca=
n grow
the number of architectures/runners/jobs/configurations to provide a covera=
ge
equal or greater to what Peter already does.

They will continue to be able use the jobs and runners already defined in
the .gitlab-ci.yml file.  This work will only affect people pushing to the/=
a
"staging" branch.

If you're looking for symmetry between any PR and "merge time" jobs, the
only solution is to allow any PR to access all the diverse set of non-share=
d
machines we're hoping to have in the near future.  This may be something
we'll get to, but I doubt we can tackle it in the near future now.

>=20

We've discussed this before at the RFC time, wrt how the goal is for a wide=
r
community to provide a wider range of jobs.  Even for x86, one may want
to require their jobs to run on a given accelerator, such as KVM, so we
need to consider that from the very beginning.

I don't see a problem with converging jobs with are being run on custom
runners back into shared runners as much as possible.  At the RFC discussio=
n,
I actually pointed out how the build phase could be running essentially
on pre-built containers (on shared runners), but the test phase, say testin=
g
KVM, should not be bound to that.=20

So in essence, right now, moving everything to containers would invalidate =
the
exercise of being able to care for those custom architectures/builds/jobs w=
e'll
need in the near future.  And that's really the whole point here.

Cheers,
- Cleber.
