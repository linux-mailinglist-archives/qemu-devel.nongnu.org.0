Oh sure, you can declare the enum in a header, and then run glib-mkenums
with that header file and it will spit out the code neccessary to
register a GEnum class. This gives you ability to do int/string conversio=
ns
with a simple api

  https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-Enumeration-and-Flag=
-Types.html
  https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/glib-mkenums.html

It makes sense to use this, since virtiofsd is already using GObject
via GDbus.
