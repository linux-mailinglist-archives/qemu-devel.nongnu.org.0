The optional field appears when both source and destination have 
bitmaps.  That is, the field is present in all cases in which 'qemu-img 
convert --bitmaps' will succeed, even when the field is 0 because there 
is nothing to copy.

If you are always using qcow2 v3 images for both source and destination, 
then the field will be present, even when it is 0.  It will only be 
absent when there is nothing to copy (either the source or destination 
format is not qcow2, or you used measure on a size rather than on a 
source image).

Okay, I'll revise the patch to get rid of the extra option (that is, 
getting it back to what it was in v3, before we had the discussion that 
prompted the addition of --bitmaps for comparison).  (I also have to 
touch up the iotests here and in 5/5)
