There are essentially two consumers of our docs

  - Sysadmins running / interacting with QEMU
  - Application developers building QEMU mgmt tools

In the sysadmin use case, they'll primarily care about docs describing
the system emulator configuration & usage, and the various tools usage.

The app devs will care about nearly all of our documentation, except for
stuff that is purely QEMU internals.

The downside of mixing tools into the general "interop" doc is that it
makes it harder to find IMHO. Thus having a dedicated "tools" doc will
be a useful grouping for sysadmins to quickly find docs relevant to
daily admin tasks.

Daniel
