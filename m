I expressed myself poorly.  All three are related, but there's still a
distinction between each of them in my thinking.

Say we use an image format that compresses data.  Represents the padding
efficiently.  Storage on disk is efficient (A), and so is reading it
(B).  Trouble is decompressing it to memory dirties the memory unless we
take care not to write all-zero pages (C).

Clearer now?
