Hi folks,

I find it's the pipe buffer size is big enough to contain all the output 
of Linux booting.
So it will not call the qemu_chr_fe_add_watch.

If I output more characters more than 64KB,  it will call the 
qemu_chr_fe_add_watch and serial_watch_cb.

By this way, I verify the code-path.

Thanks Peter. It's really a right answer.

        <pre class="moz-quote-pre" wrap="">This code is here to handle the case where the UART wants to pass
data to the chardev which is acting as the backend to the UART

Older UART code (eg hw/char/pl011.c) calls qemu_chr_fe_write_all()
to write data, but this is a blocking call and these calls are
usually marked with an XXX/TODO comment, because if the chardev
backend can't currently accept the data then execution of the
guest will be blocked until the backend does start to accept
data again.

The solution to this bug was the introduction of the non-blocking
qemu_chr_fe_write() call. But to use the non-blocking call, the
UART emulation code now needs to handle the case where
qemu_chr_fe_write() says "I couldn't write all the data you asked
me to". In that case, it must use qemu_chr_fe_add_watch() to
request a callback when the chardev is able to accept new data,
so that it can try again. (It also needs to emulate telling the
guest that the transmit FIFO is not yet empty via whatever status
registers the UART has for that, because in the meantime guest
execution will continue with some of the data still not sent to
the chardev, but sitting in the emulated FIFO; and it needs to
correctly emulate "guest tried to write more data to a full FIFO".
Older UART emulations that use the blocking write_all function
don't need to bother with these details because there the tx
FIFO is always empty -- from the guest's perspective data written
to the tx FIFO drains instantaneously.)

The common case execution path is "the chardev can accept the data
faster than the guest can feed it to the UART", in which case
qemu_chr_fe_write() will return 'wrote all the data' and the
UART never needs to call qemu_chr_fe_add_watch(). To exercise the

      Hi Peter,<br>
      <br>
      Thanks, it's really a reasonable answer. However I still have one
      question.<br>
      <br>
      When I tried to verify the code-path, the callback is not
      triggered.<br>
      The serial I used is hw/serial.c, back ended with a named pipe.<br>
      <br>
      The first step is make named pipe by<br>
      <pre>mkfifo xpipe</pre>

      Set a breakpoint on serial_watch_cb before run the Linux<br>
      <pre>b serial_watch_cb
</pre>
      Then run the Linux. The breakpoint will never matched.  I think
      "there is nothing on the other end reading data".<br>
      <br>
      Then I tried another way to verify. Read the pipe a little later
      after booting(There are some data in the FIFO already) by<br>
      <pre>cat xpipe</pre>
      Now I can read some data out from the pipe. But it still can't
      match the breakpoint. I think the reading  will set the G_IO_OUT
      condition,<br>
      but it doesn't.<br>
