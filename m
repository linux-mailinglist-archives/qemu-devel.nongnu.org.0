Agreed.  The difficulty is distinguishing those two cases and handling
them both correctly.

Hm, in this case it's pretty unclear what the right action is.
Failing the migration outright is bad, but shifting the guest's real
time clock by minutes is pretty bad too.

Sounds reasonable, but the problem is I'm not sure there's a clear way
to tell that the guest has been explicitly stopped - that is with a
"stop" monitor instruction - rather that just the automatic stop due
to the vm_stop() in the migration path.
