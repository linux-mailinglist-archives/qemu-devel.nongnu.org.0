This is where memslots come in.  Think of memslots as a one-level page tablea
that translate GPAs to HVAs.  A memslot, set by userspace, tells KVM the
corresponding HVA for a given GPA.

Before the guest is running (assuming host userspace isn't broken), the
userspace VMM will first allocate virtual memory (HVA) for all physical
memory it wants to map into the guest (GPA).  It then tells KVM how to
translate a given GPA to its HVA by creating a memslot.

To avoid getting lost in a tangent about page offsets, let's assume array[0]'s
GPA = 0xa000.  For KVM to create a GPA->HPA mapping for the guest, there _must_
be a memslot that translates GPA 0xa000 to an HVA[*].  Let's say HVA = 0xb000.

On an EPT violation, KVM does a memslot lookup to translate the GPA (0xa000) to
its HVA (0xb000), and then walks the host page tables to translate the HVA into
a HPA (let's say that ends up being 0xc000).  KVM then stuffs 0xc000 into the
EPT tables, which yields:

  GPA    -> HVA    (KVM memslots)
  0xa000    0xb000

  HVA    -> HPA    (host page tables)
  0xb000    0xc000

  GPA    -> HPA    (extended page tables)
  0xa000    0xc000

To keep the EPT tables synchronized with the host page tables, if HVA->HPA
changes, e.g. HVA 0xb000 is remapped to HPA 0xd000, then KVM will get notified
by the host kernel that the HVA has been unmapped and will find and unmap
the corresponding GPA (again via memslots) to HPA translations.

Ditto for the case where userspace moves a memslot, e.g. if HVA is changed
to 0xe000, KVM will first unmap all old GPA->HPA translations so that accesses
to GPA 0xa000 from the guest will take an EPT violation and see the new HVA
(and presumably a new HPA).

[*] If there is no memslot, KVM will exit to userspace on the EPT violation,
    with some information about what GPA the guest was accessing.  This is how
    emulated MMIO is implemented, e.g. userspace intentionally doesn't back a
    GPA with a memslot so that it can trap guest accesses to said GPA for the
    purpose of emulating a device.
