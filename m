It's well known. For example, the pci hot-plug specification, version
1.1, states:

1.6 Asssumptions

...

1.6.2 Orderly Removal and Insertion

...

Furthermore, PCI add-in cards are not generally designed to be connected to=
 a slot that
has power applied. Therefore, the operating-system vendor and Platform vend=
or define a
sequence of user actions and system behavior that guarantees that power is =
always
removed from a slot before a card is inserted.

Inserting or removing an add-in card without following the proper sequence =
leads to
unpredictable results, including data corruption, abnormal termination of t=
he operating
system, or damage to card or Platform hardware. Unless otherwise stated, it=
 is assumed
throughout the remainder of this specification that the user always follows=
 the proper
removal and insertion sequence.

...


2.1 System Components

...

The physical
insertion or removal must not occur until the system software has:
=E2=80=A2 Quiesced any operating system services or drivers using the add-i=
n card
=E2=80=A2 Isolated and powered down the slot
=E2=80=A2 Indicated to the user that it is ready
If an add-in card is inserted or removed without following the proper seque=
nce, this is
considered an improper operation and error conditions and other unexpected =
events are
possible, including data corruption and hardware damage.

and so on.


> This isn=E2=80=99t true. =E2=80=9C_SUN=E2=80=9D is used to detect the slo=
t unique number.

That's just enumeration.

> Windows does allow hot plugging on the bridge on which EJ0 has been turne=
d off.

Given no real or virtual hardware that does that, there's no guarantee
that I can see that it will keep supporting that in future versions.
