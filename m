This is the best option I've come up with so far - but it's not a good
one! We can replace the set_bit() with a test_and_set_bit() to catch the
race after it has occurred - but I'm not sure what we can do about it
then (we've already wiped the data). Returning an error doesn't seem
particularly useful at that point, a message in dmesg is about the best
I can come up with.

I can't see how this is going to work without harming the performance of
non-MTE work. Ultimately we're trying to add some sort of locking for
two (mostly) unrelated processes doing page table operations, which will
hurt scalability.

This is certainly tempting, although sadly the existing
wait_on_page_bit() is sleeping - so this would either be a literal spin,
or we'd need to implement a new non-sleeping wait mechanism.

4. Sledgehammer locking in mte_sync_page_tags(), add a spinlock only for
the MTE case where we have to sync tags (see below). What the actual
performance impact of this is I've no idea. It could certainly be bad
if there are a lot of pages with MTE enabled, which sadly is exactly
the case if KVM is used with MTE :(
