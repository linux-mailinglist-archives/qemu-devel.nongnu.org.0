Yes, that would be viable, as an existing CLI arg usage would continue
to be supported as before.

We could also list the back compat syntax as a deprecation in the docs
(qemu-deprecated.texi) so that in a few releases in the future, we can
drop the old syntax and then use nvme-ns exclusively thereafter.
