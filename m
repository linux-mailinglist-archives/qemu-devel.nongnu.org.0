Ciao Paolo,

this gives me an idea, we already basically have a target-specific part of a cpu QEMU object.

I basically was looking for a place to graft accelerator-specific code in order to refactor target/i386/cpu..., 
to split between tcg stuff and non-tcg stuff, and thus refactor even more code.

In the past I thought to put them here for example:

diff --git a/target/i386/cpu-qom.h b/target/i386/cpu-qom.h
index 3e96f8d668..3716c3e949 100644
--- a/target/i386/cpu-qom.h
+++ b/target/i386/cpu-qom.h
@@ -72,6 +72,12 @@ typedef struct X86CPUClass {
     DeviceRealize parent_realize;
     DeviceUnrealize parent_unrealize;
     DeviceReset parent_reset;
+
+    /* methods operating on CPUX86State */
+    uint32_t (*cpu_compute_eflags)(CPUX86State *env);
+    void (*cpu_set_mxcsr)(CPUX86State *env, uint32_t mxcsr);
+    void (*cpu_set_fpuc)(CPUX86State *env, uint16_t fpuc);
+    void (*cpu_report_tpr_access)(CPUX86State *env, TPRAccess access);
 } X86CPUClass;
 
 typedef struct X86CPU X86CPU;


But maybe that is the right component?

Just thinking out loud here.

Ciao,

Claudio
