HyperV using irq 5 doesn't mean QEMU has to too.  Especially so as no
guest was noticed to use the irqs in ACPI.  I'd rather try and test if
the guest requires any those at all.

They already are there.

Right, but, as you can see, they are pretty dumb, so the question is
whether they are necessary or the guests can do without (Linux
apparently can).

Thanks,
Roman.
