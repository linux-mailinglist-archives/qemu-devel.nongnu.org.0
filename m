Hi Peter,

CC Rob, who made these properties mandatory in the pl061 DT bindings.

Indeed, else QEMU will differ (more) from real hardware. Most PL061
GPIO controllers in DTS files in upstream Linux are marked as interrupt
controllers (a few haven't been updated yet).

I'll defer that one to Rob, too.

Doh, bad wording on my side :-)

Actually it is: the virt board has a gpio-keys node that ties the
Poweroff key to a PL061 GPIO. The Linux gpio-keys driver relies on
interrupts to detect key events (for IRQ incapable GPIOs you have to use
"gpio-keys-polled" instead). This can easily be verified by looking at
/proc/interrupts on the guest:

 48:          0  9030000.gpio   3 Edge      GPIO Key Poweroff

(Unfortunately I don't know how to trigger a virtual key press in the
 guest)

Seems I was wrong: arm/virt does have the Poweroff key, and Linux does
find the interrupt.

Because the GIC (usually?) does not have its interrupt lines brought
outside the SoC, but defers external interrupt handling to a specialized
external IRQ handling block, or to a GPIO controller with interrupt
capabilities (or to PCI MSI).
If you have an external (non-PCI) device that needs to trigger an
interrupt (e.g. an I2C sensor), its to be tied to the specialized block,
or to a GPIO controller.

There are plenty of working examples for this.

Obviously these can (and IMHO should) be fixed, too, together with all
other validation issues.
