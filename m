It isn=E2=80=99t, filters can have non-filter children.  For example, bac=
kup-top
could have the source as a filtered child and the target as a non-filter
child.

=E2=80=9Cfiltered=E2=80=9D means: If the parent node returns data from th=
is child, it
won=E2=80=99t modify it, neither its content nor its position.  COW and R=
/W
filters differ in how they handle writes; R/W filters pass them through
to the filtered child, COW filters copy them off to some other child
node (and then the filtered child=E2=80=99s data will no longer be visibl=
e at
that location).

The main reason behind the common =E2=80=9Cfiltered=E2=80=9D name is for =
the generic
functions that work on both COW and true filter (R/W filters) chains.
We need such functionality sometimes.  I personally felt like the
concept of true (R/W) filters and COW children was similar enough to
share a common name base.

qcow2 has a COW child.  As such, it acts as a COW filter in the sense of
the function names.

raw has neither a COW child nor acts as an R/W filter.  As such, it has
no filtered child.  My opinion on this hasn=E2=80=99t changed.

(To reiterate, in practice I see no way anyone would ever use raw as an
R/W filter.
Either you use it without offset/size, in which case you simply use it
in lieu of a format node, so you precisely don=E2=80=99t want it to act a=
s a
filter when it comes to allocation information and so on (even though it
can be classified a filter here).
Or you use it as kind of a filter with offset/size, but then it no
longer is a filter.

Filters are defined by =E2=80=9CEvery filter must fulfill these condition=
s: ...=E2=80=9D
=E2=80=93 not by =E2=80=9CEverything that fulfills these conditions is a =
filter=E2=80=9D.
Marking a driver as a filter has consequences, and I don=E2=80=99t see wh=
y we
would want those consequences for raw.)

It=E2=80=98s the right function to iterate along a filter chain.  This in=
cludes
COW backing children and R/W filtered children.

I=E2=80=99ll look into it.
