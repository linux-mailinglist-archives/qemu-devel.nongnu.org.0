Nope. I don't expect existing 'virt' users to switch to 'minic' as
they aim to cater to different users.

Here are the major differences
1. virt machine supports MMIO devices & wired interrupts. Minic doesn't
2. virt machine doesn't support the MSI only option yet (can be added
though[1]). Minic does.
3. Number of cpu supported by virt machine are limited because of the
MMIO devices. Minic can scale to very
large numbers of cpu.
4. 'Minic' only supports PCI based MSI capable devices. Thus, MSI is a
mandatory requirement for 'minic' while
it is optional for 'virt'.

'Minic' aims towards the users who want to create virtual machines
that are MSI based and don't care about
a million options that virt machines provide.  Virt machine is more
complex so that it can be flexible in terms of
what it supports. Minic is a minimalistic machine which doesn't need
to be expanded a lot in the future given that
most of the devices can be behind PCI.

Any future hardware that relies only on PCI-MSI based devices, they
can be created on top of minic.
At that point, minic will provide a useful abstract for all those
machines as well. minic doesn't need a virtio framework.
Thus, it can closely emulate such hardware as well.

I envision 'minic' to be a standard machine for a specific set of user
requirements (x86 style PCI based
machines). Virt machine will continue to be a standard machine for
more generic use cases with MMIO devices.
