I think this series is ready to go.

Patch 6 "roms: Add virtual Boot ROM for NPCM7xx SoCs" needs a few
add-ons which can come later.

Patch 13 "tests/acceptance: console boot tests for quanta-gsj" needs
an Acked-by by our test gurus. Aspeed needs the same kind of tests
if possible. It depends on the pressure that the QEMU CI will put on 
the web servers hosting the images.

I think that the rest of the comments are minor and can be fixed
as follow-ups when 5.2 is being assembled. 

Thanks,

C.
