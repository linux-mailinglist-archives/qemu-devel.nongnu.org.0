Just to be extra clear, Avocado itself doesn't require online access, but:

 * "make check-venv" will download packages from PyPI if the same
   Avocado version is not previously installed in the system

 * "make check-acceptance" depends on "make check-venv"

 * many tests depend on downlodable assets

Understood and agreed.  I've already adopted this approach in the
"boot_linux.py" series I'm working (about to send v8).  If the
download/preparation of images fail, we cancel the tests.  I'll look
into making that the default across all tests or in the base
avocado_qemu.Test class.

We could also have a "make check-acceptance-prepare" kind of target,
that won't run the tests, but will download all needed assets.

OK, RFE taken.

The underlying "asset fetcher" utility code supports multiple locations
and multiple cache dirs (and one could be a read-only NFS-like storage):

  https://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/73.0/api/utils/avocado.utils.=
html#avocado.utils.asset.Asset

But we need to make that easily accessible/configurable to users
of the fetch_asset() Test method.  RFE taken.

Agreed, and I already have a prototype.  I'll send the RFC/patches to
the list ASAP.

Thanks *so much* for this feedback!  I'll provide individual feedback as
each of those items progresses.
