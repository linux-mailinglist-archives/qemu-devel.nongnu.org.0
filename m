I just threw your meson-poc-next branch at our CI systems. Observations:

1) If no meson is installed, configure quickly aborts with "ERROR: Meson
not found. Use --meson=/path/to/meson|git|internal":

 https://gitlab.com/huth/qemu/-/jobs/675533520

Could you simply change it to default got git/internal instead (where is
the difference between git and internal?), so that we do not have to add
a --meson=xxx to all the CI jobs everywhere?

2) With --meson=git added, I also do not get much further:
 "./ui/meson.build:77:0: ERROR: Program 'keycodemapdb/tools/keymap-gen'
not found"

 https://gitlab.com/huth/qemu/-/jobs/675546229

Any idea what's going wrong here?

3) macOS build fails in a different way:

../meson.build:1:0: ERROR: Value "gnu++03" for combo option "C++
language standard to use" is not one of the choices. Possible choices
are: "none", "c++98", "c++03", "c++11", "c++14", "c++17", "c++1z",
"c++2a", "gnu++11", "gnu++14", "gnu++17", "gnu++1z", "gnu++2a".

ERROR: meson setup failed

 https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6514035426328576

Maybe we should use gnu++11 for C++ code nowadays? ... we still used
gnu++98 in the past since GCC 4.8 (from CentOS/RHEL 7) has only
"experimental" support for c++11 ... but since we're soon (in less than
a year) going to drop support for that anyway, maybe we could switch it
now already to gnu++11 ... ?
