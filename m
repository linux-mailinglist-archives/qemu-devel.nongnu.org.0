Yeah the meaning of mmap_min_addr should be exactly that which is odd
why the kernel doesn't honour the request. That said it seems to be a
user tweakable knob so you could just up it.

OK - one other test you try is running inside a chroot which *does not*
have visibility of /proc. That will cause it to fall back to the old
probing technique of trying multiple mmap operations to find the hole. I
suspect that works because the attempt to map 0x1000 would fail the
check. The reason we default to probing /proc/self/map now is that brute
force technique falls over when trying to probe for a hole on 64 bit
systems, especially when built with stack protection/clang debug
instrumentation.

In the meantime I'll spin up a patch to improve the failure mode.
