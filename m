Hmm, even if a device is running against pinned memory, how do we
handle device interrupts that occur during QEMU's downtime?  I see that
we reconfigure interrupts, but does QEMU need to drain the eventfd and
manually inject those missed interrupts or will setting up the irqfds
trigger a poll?  Thanks,

Alex
