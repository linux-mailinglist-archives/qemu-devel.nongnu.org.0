I may miss something but I don't find the code to block UNMAP notifiers?

vhost_iommu_region_add()
     memory_region_register_iommu_notifier()
         memory_region_update_iommu_notify_flags()
             imrc->notify_flag_changed()
                 vtd_iommu_notify_flag_changed()

?

Yes, it can solve the issues of duplicated UNMAP issue of vhost.

Yes, so the question is what's the assumption before calling 
memory_region_iommu_replay(). If it assumes an empty mapping, there's 
probably no need for unamp.

Ok, that explains.

Probably, but need to answer the above question about replay first.
