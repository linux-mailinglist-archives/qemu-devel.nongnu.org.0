Looking at it from an architectural perspective: If an IPL Information 
Block specifying the boot device has been set and can be retrieved using 
Diagnose 308 it has to be respected, even if the device doesn't contain 
a bootable program. The boot has to fail in this case.

I had not the bandwidth to follow all code paths, but I gather that this 
is still the case with the series. So one can argue that these changes 
are taking care of an undefined situation (real hardware will always 
have the IPIB set).

As long as the architecture is not violated, I can live with the 
proposed changes. I however would like to point out that this only 
covers a corner case (no -boot or -device ..,bootindex specified). A VM 
defined and started with libvirt will always specify the boot device. 
Please don't create the impression that this patches will lead to the 
same behavior as on other platforms. It is still not possible to have an 
order list of potential boot devices in an architecture compliant way.
