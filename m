The issue isn't HMP being unavailable while a command executes.  The
issue is HMP stopping the main loop while a command executes.

Stopping the main loop not only stops everything running there, it can
also stop other threads when they synchronize with the main loop via the
Big QEMU Lock.

The obvious example is a command accessing a remote filesystem.  Special
case: NFS with the hard option can hang indefinitely.

screendump does that, and also waits for asynchronous gfx_update() with
qxl devices.  Networking again, with a different peer.

We already decided that QMP commands stopping the main loop is serious.

To say it's not serious for HMP amounts to "don't do that then, use
QMP".  Which may be fair.  Not for me to decide, though.
