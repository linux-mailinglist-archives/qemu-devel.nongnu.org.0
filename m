Doesn't work: This is a struct that is embedded at the start of
CoroutineUContext, so while you can move it down a bit, you'll never get
to the end of the actual struct used at runtime.

It would be a little more generic, I guess. So for a solution that wants
to look generic, it might be better.

But as long as we don't have a second user (not even in our
imagination), I'm not sure how important it is to have something that
looks generic. With the simple and stupid patch, it would be more
obvious that it doesn't hurt cases that are unrelated to the monitor.

It is a hot path for block device requests. To be more specific, the
part that is executed when taking a coroutine from the pool or putting
it back to the pool is. The code to create a coroutine from scratch or
to actually free it may be less relevant.
