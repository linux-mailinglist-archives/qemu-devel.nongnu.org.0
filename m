I will definitely give it a try tomorrow. The fix to change the machine =
type was not working. I was too fast with my assumption.

What I see is the following:

Machine boots up (cold start), has network connectivity. As soon as the =
Graphics are initialized, the vhost_region_add_section error pops up and
Networking is interrupted. When I then migrate the vServer to another =
host Networking works again. It even seems to keep working when I do a
soft reset (shutdown -r). The only thing that breaks networking again =
when the graphic is initialized is a hard reset (system reset via hmp or =
amp).

Thank you,
Peter
