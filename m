Not yet.  I posted the series for some initial reviews first before
moving on with performance tests.

My plan of the test scenario could be:

- find a guest with relatively large memory (I would guess it is
  better to have memory like 64G or even more to make some big
  difference)

- run random dirty memory workload upon most of the mem, with dirty
  rate X Bps.

- setup the migration bandwidth to Y Bps (Y should be bigger than X
  but not that big.  One could be X=800M and Y=1G to emulate 10G nic
  with a workload that we can still converge with precopy only) and
  start precopy migration.

- measure total migration time with CLEAR_LOG on & off. We should
  expect the guest to have these with CLEAR_LOG: (1) not hang during
  log_sync, and (2) migration should complete faster.

Does above test plan makes sense?

If both the QEMU/KVM changes looks ok in general, I can at least try
this on some smaller guests (I can manage ~10G mem guests with my own
hosts, but I can also try to find some bigger ones).

Thanks,
