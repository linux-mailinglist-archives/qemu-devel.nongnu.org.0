I don't thinnk we should be emitting warnings/printlns at all
in this case though. The app should be able to consume the
enum without needing a warning.  If the app wants to validate
against a specific set of constants, it can decide to emit
a warning if there was a case it can't handle. We shouldn't
emit warnings/errors in the unmarshalling step though,as it
isn't the right place to decide on such policy.

Essentially every release of QEMU will have QAPI changes. Most of
the time these are append-only changes. ie a new struct, new command,
new field, new enum value.  Sometimes there will be removals due
to deprecation, though note my other reply saying that we really
ought to stop doing removals from the schema, and instead just
annotate when a field stops being used.

Daniel
