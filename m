Hi Alex,

thanks a lot for looking at this,

Interesting, I did not think to check these numbers (anymore, I was at Huawei times).
It is still quite a large size.

Interesting I did not remember this one in RFCv10, will try to see if I can reproduce on v11.

This is a known bug in RFCv10, and a known problem, it should be fixed now in RFCv11.

All in all, the accel cpu pattern seems to apply decently to ARM,
but the biggest questions open I think from my side are around the "max" cpu refactoring patch.

Thanks a lot for trying this out!

Ciao,

Claudio
