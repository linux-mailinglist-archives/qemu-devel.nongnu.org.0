Hi Alexander,

Some comments, and questions below...

It might be worth having a little more on this, since I would
imagine most people would be more interested in 64-bit these days,
but are unlikely to have 20Tb available :)

But if there is little to be gained by the 64-bit vs 32-bit if
fuzzing a device, then it might be worth explaining why.

Reading this, it kind of implies that it should be also possible to
build i386-softmmu/all still - which from what I can see it isn't,
the build fails with an undefined 'main' - most likely the main.o
object is not being linked in for this target?

Unfortunately, also doing the above build command is also failing
for me after applying this set of patches:

  qemu-upstream-libfuzz/tests/fuzz/fuzz.c:149:28: error: expected expression
      fuzz_qts = qtest_setup(void);
                             ^
  1 error generated.
  make[1]: *** [tests/fuzz/fuzz.o] Error 1

This is due to the (void) in the calling of the function, will comment on the
patch separately.

I would suggest adding an example of doing a run for this here.

It might be worth explicitly mentioning that Libfuzzer provides it's
own main() function which calls these.

Is this still true with this patchset? I don't see real_main being
defined any more in vl.c.
