Hold up - I'm a little confused now. Why does the host TLS affect the
guest TLS? We have complete control over the guests view of the world so
we should be able to control it's TLS storage.

I'm getting a little lost now. Exactly what state are we trying to share
between two QEMU guests which are now in separate execution contexts?
