OK, I will add the patch in the next MIPS queue, since I think its
significance is more than trivial. It will be sent no later than two weeks
from now. I just wanted the patch to be in the same queue when we will
provide replacement. But, honestly, if the factual state lasted that long,
I don't see the reason for such sudden hurry, do you?

I do not act alone (as an independant person) in this community, I
represent the company I am working for (in this case Wave, the owner of
MIPS), and of course I need from time to time to consult other people,
which takes some tome sometimes. Most of you are, I guess, in the same
situation from time to time.

Of course I respect James' decision, although I am trully sorry about it.
My only slight objection is that James should have sent this patch sooner,
rather than just leave an impression that there is a maintainer, while in
fact there wasn't. What did you wait? But, never mind, I understand your
hesitation. The best outcome would be that James remained in that role (I
do remember him as an excellent, thorough engineer, that is approachable
and very helpful to others), but what can we do now. I wish we work
together in future, who knows? Thanks, James, for taking care of KVM for
MIPS for number of years!

Thanks to all too,
Aleksandar
