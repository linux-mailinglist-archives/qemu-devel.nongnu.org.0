This series adds NVDIMM support to arm/virt platform.
The series reuses some of the patches posted by Eric
in his earlier attempt here[1].

This series previously had few fixes to qemu in general
which were discovered while adding nvdimm support to arm/virt.
Those were sent out seperately[2] and are now part of Qemu.

Patch #1 is another fix to the nvdimm aml issue discussed
here[3].

I have done a basic sanity testing of NVDIMM devices
with Guest booting with ACPI. Further testing is always
welcome.

Please let me know your feedback.

Thanks,
Shameer
