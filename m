Sure although I suspect the overhead is not that great. For linux-user
on 64 bit systems we only allocate 128Mb of translation buffer per
process. What sort of size systems are you expecting to run on and how
big are the binaries?

I suspect that cross-arch highly threaded apps are still in the realm of
"wow, that actually works, neat :-)" for linux-user. We don't have the
luxury of falling back to a single thread like we do for system
emulation so things like strong-on-weak memory order bugs can still trip
us up.

I think that's fair. I'll leave it to the maintainers to chime in if
they have something to add. I'd already given some comments on patch 1 and
given it needs a re-spin I'll have another look on the next iteration.

I will say expect the system to get some testing on multiple backends so
if you can expand your testing beyond an x86_64 host please do.
