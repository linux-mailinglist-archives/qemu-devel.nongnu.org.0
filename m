You're looking for

'-Wpointer-arith'
     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
     or of 'void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
     convenience in calculations with 'void *' pointers and pointers to
     functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
     'NULL'.  This warning is also enabled by '-Wpedantic'.
