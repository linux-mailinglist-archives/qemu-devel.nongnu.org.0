I'm not sure here, but it looks like that in this case the device state
will be:
  disconnect -> stopped (will not be changed during migration, because
  reconnect isn't supported)
And because of it the device state will not be changed during migration,
so there is no need for log and migration could be completed
successfully.
So as i see it (i could be wrong here) that:
 - it is okay: if device is not started and we will not change this
   state during migration + log start is failed
 - it is not okay: if device is started + log start is failed (because
   we can't handle the dirty pages and so on during migration)

Maybe if we get a disconnect during migration then we could postphone or
just don't make reconnect at all till the end of migration on the source
side. This will make a device left in the stopped state.
