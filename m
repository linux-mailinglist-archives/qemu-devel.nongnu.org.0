You've got bigger problems than what is visible to the guest. 
block/qcow2.c operates on a cluster at a time; if you are stating that 
it now requires reading multiple clusters to operate on one, qcow2 will 
have to do lots of wasteful read-modify-write cycles.  You really need a 
strong reason to support a maximum larger than 2M other than just "so 
the guest can experiment with it".
