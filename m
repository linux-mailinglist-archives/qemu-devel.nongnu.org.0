Hi! Sorry me missing the discussion for a long time.

About new job semantics: if you create temporary bitmaps anyway, I do think that we should allow to populate into target bitmap directly, without creating any internal temporary bitmaps. I suggested it when reviewing v1, John argued for more transaction-like semantics to look like other jobs. Still, we can support both modes if we want.

Allowing to use one target for several populating job is an interesting idea. Current series does "bdrv_dirty_bitmap_set_busy(target_bitmap, true);", which forbids it.. Hmm. If we just drop it, nothing prevents user just remove target bitmap during the job. So, we'll need something like collective-busy bitmap..

Hmm. I had a plan of creating "lazy" disabled bitmaps, to optimize scenario with one active bitmap, so that disabled bitmaps are not loaded into RAM on start, but only on demand. But how to do it with "many active bitmaps" scenario? I don't think that's a good idea.. Possibly, we can implement laziness by internally make only one active bitmap and merge it here and there when you request some active bitmap which we actually didn't load yet..

Could you describe, what is the exact problem with "several disabled - one active" scheme, and how is it solved by "several active"?

Unexpected turn. When all this topic only started, it was reasoned more like "if user forget to create bitmap at start, let's help him".. But now it becomes the common scenario. Hmm.

What do you think of granularity? We in Virtuozzo use 1M cluster as a default for qcow2 images. But we use 64k granularity (default) for bitmaps, to have smaller incremental backups. So, this is advantage of creating bitmap over relaying on block-status capturing by block-dirty-bitmap-populate: you don't control dirtiness granularity. So, I think that bitmap propagation, or just creating new dirty bitmap to track dirtiness from start of new snapshot is better.

(just thinking out loud)

So, assume the sequence top -> middle -> base

If we have a backup, which was done when we were in base, than bitmap is stored in base. And  is loaded, and is active, but don't changes really, as base is opened read-only.]
We merge block-status information of top and middle together with this bitmap, and aggregate difference between last backup and current state.

So, the aim is not to miss any new writes after switching to new bs, but do not capture into bitmaps writes which are copying the whole disk during mirror.

I don't follow. How do you populate these new temporary bitmaps? They are empty after creation..

What is 'merge' step? Do you mean that populating directly into target bitmap is not really needed?
