May not very large.  Just one or two additional check in instruction 
translation. You can see the patch at:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230412030648.80470-1-liweiwei@iscas.ac.cn/

Yeah. they may be visible to external tools if they read cfg directly.

Another way is to introduce another parameter instead of cfg.ext_zca to 
indicate whether Zca/Zcf/Zcd

instructions are enabled. This is be done by patchset:

https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230410033526.31708-1-liweiwei@iscas.ac.cn/

All of the three ways are acceptable to me.
