Hi Peter,

I've just been testing on QEMU v4.1.0-rc1, and found a case where the
DTB overlapped the end of the kernel, and I think there's a bug in this
patch -- explanation below.

Note: this is the start of the kernel image...

... but here we add kernel_size to the start of the loader, which is
below the kernel. Should that be info->entry?

I've seen this trigger a case where:

* The kernel's image_size is 0x0a7a8000
* The kernel was loaded at   0x40080000
* The end of the kernel is   0x4A828000
* The DTB was loaded at      0x4a800000

... and the kernel is unable to find a usable DTB.

Thanks,
Mark.
