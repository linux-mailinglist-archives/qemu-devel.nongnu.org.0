Thanks, Yan.  So it seems we have various bugs, known limitations, and
we haven't actually proven that this implementation provides a useful
feature, at least for the open source consumer.  This doesn't give me
much confidence to consider the kernel portion ready for v5.7 given how
late we are already :-\  Thanks,
