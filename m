I'm not sure I fully understand the implications of 'background-snapshot' ?

Based on what the QAPI comment says, it sounds potentially interesting,
as conceptually it would be nicer to have the memory / state snapshot
represent the VM at the point where we started the snapshot operation,
rather than where we finished the snapshot operation.

It would not solve the performance problems that the work in this thread
was intended to address though.  With large VMs (100's of GB of RAM),
saving all the RAM state to disk takes a very long time, regardless of
whether the VM vCPUs are paused or running.

Currently when doing this libvirt has a "libvirt_iohelper" process
that we use so that we can do writes with O_DIRECT set. This avoids
thrashing the host OS's  I/O buffers/cache, and thus negatively
impacting performance of anything else on the host doing I/O. This
can't take advantage of multifd though, and even if extended todo
so, it still imposes extra data copies during the save/restore paths.


So to speed up the above 3 libvirt APIs, we want QEMU to be able to
directly save/restore mem/vmstate to files, with parallization and
O_DIRECT.

No, we've no need for live mode for virDomainManagedSave. Live mode is
needed for virDomainSnapshot* APIs.

The point I'm making is that all three of the above libvirt APIs run exactly
the same migration code in libvirt. The only difference in the APIs is how
the operation gets striggered and whether the CPUs are running or not.

We wwant the improved performance of having parallel save/restore-to-disk
and use of O_DIRECT to be available to all 3 APIs. To me it doesn't make
sense to provide different impls for these APIs when they all have the
same end goal - it would be extra work on QEMU side and libvirt side alike
to use different solutions for each.
