property should be on, but not by setting in kvm_default_prop / applied via kvm_default_prop, that mechanism is for the versioned cpu models,
which use X86CPUModel / X86CPUDefinition , and "host" isn't one of them.

Out of curiosity, does my previous snippet actually work? Not that I am sure it is the best solution,
just for my understanding. It would be surprising to me that the need to actually manually apply "kvm-msi-ext-dest-id" to "on" there.

seems right to abort if requesting > 255 APIC IDs cannot be satisfied, I agree.

So I think in the end, we want to:

1) make sure that when accel=kvm and smp > 255 for i386, using cpu "host", kvm_enable_x2apic() is called and successful.

2) in addressing requirement 1), we do not break something else (other machines, other cpu classes/models, TCG, ...).

3) as a plus we might want to cleanup and determine once and for all where kvm_enable_x2apic() should be called:
   we have calls in intel_iommu.c and in the kvm cpu class instance initialization here in kvm-cpu.c today:
   before adding a third call we should really ask ourselves where the proper initialization of this should happen.

Let me know about the previous snippet, and I'd really look for other comments from Eduardo or Paolo at this point, regarding the "what should be" question.


Ciao,

Claudio
