After the first sentence, maybe it shouldn't be. I'm only starting to
describe the problem, not what the patch does to solve it. :-)

But to clarify, this patch aims to leave the wire protocol unchanged and
remove the indirection only internally.

Fair. This patch isn't about the wire format, but I wouldn't be
surprised if I'm talking about "variants" in other places where I should
say something like "object variants" to be more precise.

Only true for unions whose structure can be represented both as flat and
as simple unions. Flat unions don't allow 'str' as a variant type, so
there is no structurally equivalent flat union. (There is a flat union
that looks the same on the write, but has a wrapper object internally.)

In the future, I would like to solve this difference between flat and
simplie unions by allowing flat union variants to have non-object types,
too (allowing the simpler C code even for flat unions). We could allow
or even require setting an explicit name instead of the fixed 'data' we
use today for simple unions.

Manual. I considered Coccinelle, but imagined fighting with it would
take longer than just doing it myself for those few simple unions that
we have.

I'm talking about representation "on the wire" (I don't think we
generally use this term for the command line, but well...). Internal
representation is always flat after this patch.

Ok, works for me. It's not true any more at the end of the series
depending on whether "wire format" can also mean CLI syntax, but for
this patch it's supposed to be true.

One major problem I noticed in the QAPI spec is that it's really tied to
QMP and QMP only. It doesn't know anything about the command line nor
about types that we use only internally in the C code. I felt addressing
this was out of scope for this series, though.

Defining the branches first is intentional because the difference
between flat and simple is mostly just the representation of branches on
the wire. So it's hard to explain what the whole union looks like when
flat/wrapped representation hasn't been introduced yet.

Either way, I think this whole section is backwards. It should start
with unions in general, then flat unions, and then "simple" unions.
Fixing it should be a separate patch, either before this one or on top
of the series.

This doesn't seem to happen any more, I can remove this hunk. I suppose
I hadn't made the recursion in QAPISchemaVariants.check() conditional on
instanceof(..., QAPISchemaObjectType) yet.

If the comment describe all possibly situations, probably not?

This is a case where John's type annotations would be helpful to find
the right answer quickly.

By the way, it would be good if you didn't have to know commit
f9d1743b9b0 to figure out how this is supposed to work. Docstrings in
QAPISchemaEntity would probably go a long way.

After the next patch, variants can support both flat and wrapped
representation in the generated C code. Which one is used depends on the
Visitor configuration then. (Not in this series, but further in the
future, input visitors can be able to accept both forms, which gives us
an opportunity to deprecate the wrapped form.)

Checking internal consistency, I guess.

If it's necessary depends on whether something else calls check_clash(),
too. Maybe it is already called for all entities? Then this would be
unnecessary.

Because nothing else checks self.wrapper_type.

I don't know. I would have to understand all callers to tell. Again,
John's typing patches would make finding the answer easy.

We don't really want it to be a type for almost all matters. For
example, having it in the entity list would generate C code that is
never used.

The only reason this type object is even created is because the
introspection code was too painful to change to work without it, and it
can't create the object locally because it would have to access private
attributes and/or methods to do so.

So pre-creating this type here is a compromise that I already dislike.
If you think it's bad, I can try and have another look at the
introspection code and if we can somehow make it work without having a
type.

But I certainly want code that wants to see this type do additional
steps, not code that wants to exclude it. It should be invisible by
default.

Not exactly intentional in the sense that it was the goal, but it
doesn't matter much either. Only the generated introspection code
becomes a bit longer.
