Never thought of that, but perhaps it's similar to what happened with
bash. Apple shipped an old GPLv2 version of bash (3.2) for quite a while
even after 4.x release. Then they suddenly switched default shell to
zsh. Following the approach, we're more likely to see meson and ninja in
Apple Command Line Tools than GNU Make 3.82+ ðŸ™‚

As for alias, Homebrew also provides GNU coreutils and sed with g
prefix and a special gnubin prefix is provided to simplify bulk addition
of GNU tools to PATH, so it's consistent in some sense :)

Here's a related homebrew discussion about system binary shadowing:
