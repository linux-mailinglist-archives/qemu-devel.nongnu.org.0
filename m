That seems like quite a lot of effort, given that we don't really
have to update the set of syscall number #defines very often.
At the moment it's just "somebody submits a patch which
updates the list of #defines every so often". (And if you want
to actually implement a new syscall then the the actual
implementation is the bulk of the work anyhow.)

In particular if you really want to proceed down the path of
suggesting scripts for doing the update then I think we would
want something that works for all our architectures, not just MIPS.

Title:
  Please refactor linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello. I am working with qemu on test images. I've added a new syscall
  (436) to qemu but received ENOSYS from mips application.

  Please open "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c". I've added at the end of
  "mips_syscall_args" the following:

  ```
  MIPS_SYS(sys_getdents64_x32, 3)
  ```

  But

  ```
  syscall_num =3D env->active_tc.gpr[2] - 4000;
  if (syscall_num >=3D sizeof(mips_syscall_args)) {
    ret =3D -TARGET_ENOSYS;
  ```

  returns -TARGET_ENOSYS

  We can see that "linux-user/mips/cpu_loop.c" differs a lot from
  "linux-user/arm/cpu_loop.c". Arm has it's own "ARM_NR_BASE" and etc.

  Can you please refactor mips cpu loop in the same way as arm? Thank
  you.
