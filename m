To get most value from CI, we strongly prefer the test to be a clear
pass/fail.

We do have some jobs that are marked non-gating, since they have
false failures and need manual inspection of results. The effect
is those jobs are largely ignored by everyone, so not really of
significant benefit.

So I'd agree with Thomas about starting with a config that can
get a clear pass/fail, and expanding from there if we can't get
the full-tree clean from the start.

We should not look at 'roms' at all since it is just a place for
git submodulees, and build system integration. No interesting code
lives there.

We should completely ignoring 'capstone' and any other git submodule
as those are 3rd party codebases we don't maintain ourselves.
