Isn't this what it does?  To detect "replication" is unsupported, check
whether it's absent, and "supported" does not imply "works".

Yes.

Likewise, "nfs" is present in introspection data even if no NFS server
exists on your network, or you don't have permission to use it.

QAPI/QMP introspection is compile-time static by design.  It can't tell
you more than "this QEMU build supports X".  That's it's mission.

I'm not sure I understand how you propose to change introspection.
