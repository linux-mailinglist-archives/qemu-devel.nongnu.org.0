I think that's a pretty gross hack tha is abusing the unique service
concept, as we clearly don't have unique services anymore.

This means QEMU still has to iterate over every single client
on the bus to identify them. If you're doing that, there's
no point in owning a well known service at all. Just iterate
over the unique bus names and look for the exported object
path /org/qemu/VMState
