Yes, please move it somewhere else. I'd suggest something like
block/monitor/bitmap-qmp-cmds.c for the QMP command handlers, and if
there are functions that are more generally useful, block/bitmaps.c.

Instead of modifying the top-level Makefile.objs, you would just edit
block/monitor/Makefile.objs instead and add the filename there. I don't
think you need to understand any magic apart from knowing that is exists
and does what you would expect.
