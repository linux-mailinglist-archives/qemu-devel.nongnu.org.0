I agree that this should be dependent on host memory size not guest 
ram_size but it might be tricky to get that value because different host 
OSes would need different ways. Maybe a new qemu_host_mem_size portability 
function will be needed that implements this for different host OSes. 
POSIX may or may not have sysconf _SC_PHYS_PAGES and _SC_AVPHYS_PAGES and 
linux has sysinfo but don't know how reliable these are.
