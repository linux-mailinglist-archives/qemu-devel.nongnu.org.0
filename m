Dear David Gibson,

I know you are under no obligation to respond, but if it's possible for you
to find the time to respond to my question, I would be extremely grateful.
My team at Boeing has been stuck trying to get KVM working for our project
for the last few months.  A good explanation of why this isn't possible
would be absolutely critical.

-Thanks, Wayne Li
