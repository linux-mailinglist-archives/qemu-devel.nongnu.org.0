This could work, but the idea of doing the parsing twice might not be easy to implement.
We currently have the qmp parser completely separated from the rest of the qemu,
so only once the qmp command parsing is done, the corresponding callback is called.


I am thinking. Since any 'update' commmand would need to sepecify the node to work on,
one could add some kind of expression for the qmp frontend to query the driver of that
node itself, which would solve that problem


Something like that:

{ 'union': 'BlockdevAmendOptions',

  'base': {
      'node-name':         'str' },

  'discriminator': { 'get_block_driver(node-name)' } ,

  'data': {
      'file':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsFile',
      'gluster':        'BlockdevCreateOptionsGluster',
      'luks':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsLUKS',
      'nfs':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsNfs',
      'parallels':      'BlockdevCreateOptionsParallels',
      'qcow':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsQcow',
      'qcow2':          'BlockdevCreateOptionsQcow2',
      'qed':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsQed',
      'rbd':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsRbd',
      'sheepdog':       'BlockdevCreateOptionsSheepdog',
      'ssh':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsSsh',
      'vdi':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsVdi',
      'vhdx':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsVhdx',
      'vmdk':           'BlockdevCreateOptionsVmdk',
      'vpc':            'BlockdevCreateOptionsVpc'
  } }


The 'get_block_driver' expression will make the QMP frontend, take the value of the node-name union field,
and look up the block driver associated with it and use that as a discriminator.

Syntax wise we can (at some expense of readability) use json to express the same like

'discriminator': { 'field' : 'node-name', 'transform': 'getdrivername' },
