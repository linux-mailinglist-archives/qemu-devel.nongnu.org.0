OK I'm not sure my mac_oldworld patches can be finished or would be merged 
before the freeze anyway and this was already broken in 5.0 so it's not 
that urgent now but I'll need this in the future so eventually should 
find some way to come to an agreement.

This is sufficiently vague that it says "initial" which to me means it's 
not absolute and can change while the VM is running so a change due to fix 
up fits in that in my opinion :-)

That's the point. Rummimg e.g. qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1000 does not abort 
but runs the VM with an odd RAM size even though that's not possible on 
real hardware. Other machines should behave the same, within their limits: 
for sam460ex that means we need to truncate memory size to largest valid 
value becuause of SoC limits, for mac_oldworld that means with OpenBIOS it 
will see all RAM and with firmware ROM somewhat less. I've implemented 
that originally both for consistency and user convenience but this was 
"cleaned up" afterwrds and also made impossible to implement again without 
duplicating code in boards or reverting to some previous state and fixing 
the problems in a way that allows my use case as well.
