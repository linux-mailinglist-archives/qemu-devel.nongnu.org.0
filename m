I mostly only care about z13-best or "z13-raw,recommended-features=3Don"=20
for now. What's described in patch #2. Allow upper layers (or user on=20
the command line) get a CPU model that has the best features supported=20
by the accelerator on the current host. Esp., include new features to=20
mitigate security issues.
