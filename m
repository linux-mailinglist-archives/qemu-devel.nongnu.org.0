If it's reproducible with real hardware, then it's definitely not a bug
of QEMU =3D=3D> Removing QEMU from this bug ticket.

Title:
  Hint showing volume never disappears, blocking buttons to minimize,
  maximize and close

Status in xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  When hovering the mouse over the volume indicator or changing its
  volume using the mouse wheel it shows the current volume set as a
  hint. For example:

  Volume 100%

  The problem is that the hint never disappears, not even clicking on
  it. On some occasions the hint can cover the minimize, maximize and
  close buttons, causing significant problems on using the desktop
  environment, as these three buttons won't be usable anymore with the
  hint over it.

  Where the hint appears it's no longer possible to interact with the
  screen.
