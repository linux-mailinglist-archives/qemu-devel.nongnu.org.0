Eric, I truly appreciate your clarification.

But, does "configure" list somewhere unmet soft dependencies? (the
question is general, not looking at SDL only) Is there any other way for
an end user to have info on unmet dependencies (whether soft or hard),
other than see QEMU is not building, or something is not working in
QEMU run-time?

Daniel,

We had message "SDL 1.2 is going to be deprecated" in QEMU 3.0
"configure" and, if I remember well, in QEMU 3.1 as well. And now,
when we finally deprecated it, is it true that there is no message
whatsoever on systems with SDL 1.2 only?

Yours,
Aleksandar
