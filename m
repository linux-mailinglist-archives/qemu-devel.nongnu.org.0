Hmm...

    $ git-grep migration/cpu
    target/alpha/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"
    target/arm/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"
    target/cris/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"
    target/hppa/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"
    target/i386/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"

    target/ppc/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"
    target/sparc/machine.c:#include "migration/cpu.h"

Can do.

The odd one out: target/s390x/machine.c does not include
migration/cpu.h.

Yes, other targets declare vmstate_FOO_cpu in cpu.h.
