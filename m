Good point.

4096 as min. msize is fine with me.

In practice people should use a *much* higher msize for performance reasons 
anyway. And I planned to make this circumstance more clear in the docs.

Ok, noted.

No need. If it is neither 9P2000.u nor 9P2000.L then the appropriate reply of 
server was and still is:

R_version "unknown"

Since the unsupported protocol version still weights higher than the 
unsupported msize. If you are very, very picky, you might want to distinguish 
in this particular case from the case where msize is even too small for 
R_version "unknown", but personally I don't care since the latter would be an 
extreme exotic and broken client.
