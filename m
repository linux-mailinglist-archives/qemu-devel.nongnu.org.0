Given that we already have emacs mode-lines, I see no reason to
not also have vim mode-lines, so regardless of the deeper discussion
I think this is patch is fine to merge in the short term

IMHO, the critical rule is that if you a pick a particular file extension
associated with an existing language, you absolutely MUST BE compliant
with that language.

We fail at compliance with both JSON and Python because we're actually
using our own DSL (domain specific language).

IOW if we're going to stick with our current file format, then we should
be naming them .qapi. We can still use an editor mode line if we want to
claim we're approximately equiv to another language, but we can't be
surprised if editors get upset.


The bigger question is whether having our own DSL is justified ?

I'm *really* sceptical that it is.


We can't use JSON because it lacks comments. So we invented our own
psuedo-JSON parser that supported comments, and used ' instead of "
for some reason. We also needed to be able to parse a sequence of
multiple JSON documents in one file. We should have just picked a 
different language because JSON clearly didn't do what we eneeded.

You suggest naming them .py. If we do that, we must declare that they
are literally Python code and modify them so that we can load the 
files straight into the python intepretor as code, and not parse 
them as data. I feel unhappy about treating data as code though.


While JSON doesn't do what we need, its second-cousin YAML is a more
flexible format. Taking one example

---
##
# @ImageInfoSpecificQCow2:
#
# @compat: compatibility level
#
# ...snip...
#
# Since: 1.7
##
struct: ImageInfoSpecificQCow2
data:
  compat: str
  "*data-file": str
  "*data-file-raw": bool
  "*lazy-refcounts": bool
  "*corrupt": bool
  refcount-bits: int
  "*encrypt": ImageInfoSpecificQCow2Encryption
  "*bitmaps":
    - Qcow2BitmapInfo
  compression-type: Qcow2CompressionType


Then we could use a regular off the shelf YAML parser in python.

The uglyiness with quotes is due to the use of "*". Slightly less ugly
if we simply declare that quotes are always used, even where they're
not strictly required.

struct: ImageInfoSpecificQCow2
data:
  "compat": "str"
  "*data-file": "str"
  "*data-file-raw": "bool"
  "*lazy-refcounts": "bool"
  "*corrupt": "bool"
  "refcount-bits": "int"
  "*encrypt": "ImageInfoSpecificQCow2Encryption"
  "*bitmaps":
    - "Qcow2BitmapInfo"
  "compression-type": "Qcow2CompressionType"

With the use of "---" to denote the start of document, we have no trouble 
parsing our files which would actually be a concatenation of multiple 
documents. The python YAML library provides the easy yaml.load_all()
method.

Daniel
