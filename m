Default argument promotions (=C2=A76.5.2.2 Function calls) still apply: "th=
e
integer promotions are performed on each argument, and arguments that
have type float are promoted to double."

=C2=A77.19.6.1 "The fprintf function" on length modifier 'h':

    Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier
    applies to a short int or unsigned short int argument (the argument
    will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its
    value shall be converted to short int or unsigned short int before
    printing)

Integer promotions preserve value including sign.  So, printing a short
value with %hd first promotes it to int, then converts it back to short.
Neither conversion has an effect.

However, printing an int with %hd has: it converts int to short.
Implementation-defined behavior when the value doesn't fit.

Length modifier 'h' is pretty pointless with printf().  So would be a
warning to nudge people towards its use.

In fact, GNU libc's PRIu32 does not use it.  inttypes.h:

    /* Unsigned integers.  */
    # define PRIu8=09=09"u"
    # define PRIu16=09=09"u"
    # define PRIu32=09=09"u"
    # define PRIu64=09=09__PRI64_PREFIX "u"

where __PRI64_PREFIX is "l" or "ll" depending on system-dependent
__WORDSIZE.

In short:

>>> In other words "%" PRIu32 is just a less legible alias for "%u" in all
>>> cases that matter.

[...]
