It's not and error, as usual case will leave some arguments for TestEnv and TestRunner.
Assume you run ./check with some arguments.. And it works bad. You assume that problem is in testfinder.py. Then, you just take the entire list of options and call ./testfinder.py with them. And it shows, how it parses its arguments, and what is reminded. Seems correct and shouldn't be an error.

Still, maybe better to print unhandled options first, to be more noticeable.
