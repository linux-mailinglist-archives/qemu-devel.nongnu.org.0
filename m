I googled some code from comment #2 and got a hit for "u32 RCA =3D (u32)0x4=
5670000; // QEMU's hard-coded RCA". Then I found kcwang's book: https://lin=
k.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-51517-5.pdf and read:
"I am also grateful to Springer International Publishing AG for allowing me=
 to disclose the source code of this book to the public for free, which are=
 available at http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/ARMhome for download". This li=
nk gives 404, however googling again "site:www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460" I found=
 https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~cs460/samples/ which thankfully provides sdc.tgz=
 with the source files and binaries mentioned.

With the command provided in the bug description I could bisect to:

Title:
  SD Card not working in Ubuntu 18.10 (CMD 2,3 timeout).  The device
  worked fine in Ubuntu 18.04 and earlier versions but not in Ubuntu
  18.10

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  ARM PL181 MMC card no longer working in qemu-system-arm in Ubuntu 18.10
  The MMC driver code worked fine in Ubuntu 15.10 to 18.04.
  The command to run qemu-system-arm is

      qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 256M -sd sdimage -kernel t.bin
  -serial mon:stdio

  During SDC initialization, SDC commands 2, 3, 9, 13, 7, 16 all timeout, =

  which cause subsequent read/write commands 17/24 to fail also.

  Tried both ARM versatilepb and realview-pb-a8, realview-pbx-a9 boards:
  all the same.
