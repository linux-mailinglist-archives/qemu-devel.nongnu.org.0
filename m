Are you asking if we should do something like the following?

  -cpu host,sve1=on,sve=2=on,sve3=off,sve4=on

(Where the numbers represent the number of vector quadwords supported.)

Naturally that would work, but it would be super verbose and require
adding tons of properties. Or maybe you meant something else. If so,
please provide an example.
