> Hi! What are your scenarios? Are you using qemu-img by hand, or it is use=
d from some management tool? For management tool, I'd recommend to use qmp =
interface, which is a lot more strict, reliable and stable, and documented.=
 You just need to run qemu binary in stopped mode for it.

The use case is oVirt - it is a management system but it uses qemu-img
to perform various
operations, like copying disks around. The specific use case is
cloning qcow2 image chain
from one server to another, or cloning on the same server.

In the case of qcow2 images on logical volumes, we need to create a
large enough  logical
volume to copy an image, and for this we use "qemu-img measure". With
the current patches
we will be able to create large enough logical volume and copy the
image data and the bitmps
to the destination.

qmp interface is nice but to use it we have to rewrite all the code
using qemu-img to start qemu
with the relevant disks and perform operation via qmp or via libvirt.
This a huge rewrite and I'm
not sure it's worth the effort.

This approach also has limitations, for example using qemu-img we can
copy disks in parallel on
multiple hosts, while using libvirt and qemu will limit us to using
one host since qemu takes locks
that we control.

Also using libvirt means that all new features take more time to
complete since now we have
a new layer between oVirt and qemu.
