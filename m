Hmm, it doesn't look like Cortex-A9 has this property...

Unexpected error in object_property_find() at
/usr/local/google/home/hskinnemoen/qemu/upstream/qom/object.c:1254:
qemu-system-arm: Property '.cntfrq' not found

However, I did notice there are a lot of constraints on input
frequencies to the CPU and various peripherals, and many of these are
not met by the power-on reset values.

For example, the UART needs a 24 MHz input clock, but there's no way
to generate this from the default 25 MHz reference clock. However,
PLL2 is set up to run at 960 MHz by default (as soon as it's locked),
with a fixed /2 divider. The UART uses a /20 divider by default, so it
gets a 25 MHz / 20 =3D 1.25 MHz clock with power-on defaults. However,
switching the source to PLL2 results in 960 MHz / 2 / 20 =3D 24 MHz.

Similarly, the CPU is supposed to run at 800 MHz, but it runs at 25
MHz with power-on defaults. PLL1 runs at 800 MHz by default, with a
fixed /2 divider. The boot loader doubles the feedback divider so it
turns into 1600 MHz / 2 =3D 800 MHz.

Turns out I was wrong above, the patch snippet routes PLL1, not PLL2,
to the CPU. But it will only result in half the recommended speed, so
a patch to PLLCON1 is needed as well.

It seems like the cleanest solution would be to add a
write_board_setup hook to fix up these registers so clocks are within
normal ranges when bypassing the boot loader. In particular:

  - Switch UART to PLL2 for a 24 MHz input clock.
  - Set up PLL1 to run at 1600 MHz.
  - Switch the CPU core to PLL1 / 2 for a 800 MHz input clock.

Does that make sense? It should be just three simple register writes,
which is doable with hand-edited machine code.

I'll add this as a separate patch (right before the acceptance test)
so it's clear what's happening.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to make the flash boot test pass
without optimization. U-boot seems to have a tiny buffer for the
command line, so I can only disable two or three systemd services
before it gets truncated. I might try to create a reduced openbmc
image instead.
