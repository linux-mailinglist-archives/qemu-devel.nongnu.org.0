It should live alongside the VFIO documentation. For vfio-user the spec
will live in qemu.git and we could also keep this document there. The
kernel VFIO/mdev drivers also need this information. They could link to
the QEMU document.

Yes. If you are creating a custom device that no one else needs to
emulate then you can simply pick a unique URL:

  https://vendor.com/my-dev

There doesn't need to be anything at the URL. It's just a unique string
that no one else will use and therefore web URLs are handy because no
one else will accidentally pick your string.

If your intention is to define a standard device model that others can
emulate and migrate, then it's good practice to publish a web page about
the device model at the URL, including the hardware datasheet and the
device state representation (e.g. a spec describing the migration data
stream).

For example, https://virtio-spec.org/devices/pci/virtio-net would
contain a link to the VIRTIO specification and the device state
representation. This allows others to implement devices that are
compatible and support migration between implementations. This is
getting beyond the scope of this document, but I imagine the VIRTIO
device state representation would be QEMU's current vmstate
representation so that migration between QEMU and out-of-process devices
is possible...

The device synthesized by the mdev driver, because that's the
guest-visible hardware interface. I didn't want to say "guest-visible"
or refer to VMs in the document, but maybe that would make things
clearer.

I think that could be implementation-defined. Maybe it will be useful if
a device is very broken and you want to offer users a command-line that
allows them to migrate to safety.

The actual version string does not matter. Ascending integers is a
reasonable convention because it's easy to type and for humans to
compare.

Slightly pedantic but important point: migration from n->m is not
possible according to this document. It's always migration from n->n.
Migrating does not upgrade the guest-visible aspects of the device. The
device instance always remains at its current version. Of course the
destination device implementation may contain bug fixes, etc that come
into effect right away, but they don't change the guest-visible hardware
interface or device state representation.

To actually upgrade from n->m the user must explicitly reconfigure the
guest and hotplug or reboot.

In other words, the device version (always stays the same throughout the
lifetime of a device instance) and the device implementation version
(e.g. my-virtio-net-pci-v1.1) are two different concepts.

> Are these device versions supposed to be independent of machine versions?

Yes. Since VFIO devices are passthrough devices that can be implemented
without introducing code into QEMU, they are separate from versioned
machine types. This is similar to going out and buying a PCI adapter and
putting it into a machine. The machine itself may be a Dell Foo Bar
server with a certain hardware spec, but the PCI adapter is a completely
separate device with no relation to the machine type.

Yes, the device model and configuration need to be provided when
creating the mdev instance. This assumption is built into this design:

You decide the device model and configuration at creation time, not at
migration time. In other words, each device instance is fully specified
at all times and there is no choice of "in which format should we
save/load this?".

This approach is simple and easy to troubleshoot, but if someone can
think of a reason why it's too limited, please share.
