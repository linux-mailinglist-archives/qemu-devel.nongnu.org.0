After banging my head in a wall for tree or four days, I got the ac97 to
work on windows 98se applying something called "Auto-patcher for windows
98se" downloaded from retrosystemsrevival, then using the windows 95
"VXD_A406" driver updated manually by unpacking the executable and
picking the .inf file manually. The auto-patcher is mandatory to get
everything working. I followed steps from a youtube video for creating a
windows 98 VM in Virtualbox, worked on qemu. The installation process
was long and boring, but in the end, everything seems to be working
without problems (so far). All links can be found in a youtube video by
the name "Windows 98 on VirualBox Part 2. AutoPatching, AC97 Sound
Drivers, Windows 98 Plus! Gamepad Install." or in the following
pastebin: https://pastebin.com/hMvcMzFL

Title:
  Temporal freeze and slowdown while using emulated sb16

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I have been carrying around this bug since previous versions and on
  different machines: When I use the -soundhw sb16 option, while playing
  any sound on the virtual machine it temporally freezes the emulated
  machine and loops the last bit of such sound effect for 1-2 minutes,
  then goes back to normal speed (until a new sound is played).

  Console shows:

  =C2=A0sb16: warning: command 0xf9,1 is not truly understood yet
  =C2=A0sb16: warning: command 0xf9,1 is not truly understood yet
  (...)
  main-loop: WARNING: I/O thread spun for 1000 iterations

  -One of my emulated machines is Windows 3.11: I managed to overrun
  this bug by switching from the local 1.5 version of the sound blaster
  driver to the 1.0, although since I updated qemu it freezes that
  machine, so I can't test if it still works.

  I am using the 1.7.90 version, but I suffered this bug for over one
  year (confirmed in version 2.0.0-rc0 too)

  this bug happens anytime I use the -soundhw sb16 switch, but the full
  command I am using in this specific case is:

  qemu-system-i386 -localtime -cpu pentium -m 32 -display sdl -vga
  cirrus -hda c.img -cdrom win95stuff.iso -net nic,model=3Dne2k_pci -net
  user -soundhw sb16

  This bug appears on all my machines: Pentium III running Slackware
  13.0 and freeBSD 10; Dual core T2400, both in Arch, Gentoo and
  Slackware 14.1 (all 32 bits), and a Dual core T4400 64 bits with
  Gentoo and Slackware. Same problem in all of those systems after
  compiling instead of using the distro packages....
