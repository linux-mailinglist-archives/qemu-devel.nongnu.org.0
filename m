I'm not asking for a legal argument, I'm asking for a pragmatic one.

What makes that so?  Is writing a plugin without linking with QEMU code
impractical?

GPL'ed code that's not for upstream is 100% legitimate.

Correct.  We can't force anybody to distribute, and that's only proper.

I'm concerned about a third case: imlementing stuff as a plugin so you
can distribute it with a GPL-incompatible license.  Particularly
pernicious when that stuff could be useful upstream.

Are there any technical difficulties that could make distributing a
plugins in binary form impractical?
