Yes, I was working on that.

What I've done can be found here: 
https://github.com/denis-plotnikov/qemu/commits/bgs_uffd

The idea was to save a snapshot (state+ram) asynchronously to a separate 
(raw) file using the existing infrastructure.
The goal of that was to reduce the VM downtime on snapshot.

We decided to postpone this work until "userfaultfd write protected 
mode" wasn't in the linux mainstream.
Now, userfaultfd-wp is merged to linux. So we have plans to continue 
this work.

According to the saving the "internal" snapshot to qcow2 I still have a 
question. May be this is the right place and time to ask.

If I remember correctly, in qcow2 the snapshot is stored at the end of 
the address space of the current block-placement-table.
We switch to the new block-placement-table after the snapshot storing is 
complete. In case of sync snapshot, we should switch the
table before the snapshot is written, another words, we should be able 
to preallocate the the space for the snapshot and keep a link
to the space until snapshot writing is completed.
The question is whether it could be done without qcow2 modification and 
if not, could you please give some ideas of how to implement that?
