Right, but that is in practice only a problem for legacy devices, isn't
it? The standard says that non-legacy devices use little-endian
everywhere; it's the legacy 'device endian' that is causing us
headaches.

Which leads to the question: Do we really need to support legacy
virtio-fs devices, or can we just force virtio-1, as many (most?) newer
virtio devices do?
