This is because savevm can't snapshot all writable disks and fails in
this case, right? So the proposed alternative with a list of nodes to
create disk snapshots for would solve this.

It's also not the semantics you usally want for snapshots. You want to
take a snapshot of the state _now_, not of the state at some arbitrary
time in the future.

That's why I mentioned the post-copy semantics for live snapshots.

Strictly speaking, not qcow2, but "block driver that supports
snapshots". Not that it matters in practice, but this happens to include
sheepdog.

It also means that we could implement a filter driver that saves the VM
state to an external file, which would allow saving the VM state even if
you use only raw images (of course, only useful if you have means to
snapshot the disk state externally or in combination with external
snapshots).

Yes, letting commands accept both node-names and drive IDs is trivial
and we do it pretty much everywhere. Much better than randomly selecting
an image to save the VM state to.

But I'm not even sure if makign people switch to -blockdev would be a
bad thing. If they insist on bad interfaces, they can keep using HMP
'savevm', too...
