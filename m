Hi again,

Seems to be there is no solution for my problem :(
I have succeeded create NTVDMx64 patch on my Windows 10 installation, so i =
can run directly 16 bit ms dos applications without any dos emulator.
I take the initiative to close the bug.

Bye

Title:
  Aten USB to Serial bridge does not work with qemu under Windows 10

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I would like to use MSDOS 6.22 with qemu (unfortunatelly lot of our test =
programs has been written in dos).
  I tried to connect two laptop by RS232 port, one of the machine have a bu=
ilt-in serial port and run with native MSDOS 6.22 with 4.0 norton commander=
. Another machine have only USB ports and i try to use a new Aten USB to Se=
rial device. Ok. Has been started qemu with -serial and -chardev parameters=
, at startup appear a window with serial port setting such as baud rate, st=
art bit, etc...

  Quemu has been satrted succeeded but serial port cannot be used
  becouse was nothing activited on usb serial adapter :(

  I tried same configuration with VirtualBox and everything was worked
  fine (serial connection was estabiled and copied several files from
  one machine into another machine), seems to be the emulated serial
  port has been worked fine.

  I would like to use qemu, i just thougt qemu is better, simple and
  faster...

  Exists solution or is this a qemu bug?

  Thank you!
