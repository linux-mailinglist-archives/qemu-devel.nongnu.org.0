Sure, that makes sense.

Good point.

Another simplification.  Looks like I'll be spinning v2.

That changes the callers, but it's not necessarily a bad thing; whereas 
we were doing:

if (cond) {
     nbd_meta_pattern(..., &match, ...);
}

which either leaves match unchanged or sets it to true, we could instead do:

if (nbd_meta_pattern(...)) {
     match = true;
}

My only worry is that the more changes I make, the harder the patch is 
to read.  I don't know if it's worth breaking it into steps, or just 
doing all the simplifications in one blow.

Yeah, that's where it got interesting.  A direct strcmp() is nice, but 
if we strip a prefix in one place, we have to strip it in the other.  I 
could go either way.

Oh, good catch.  Using 0 is an unintended logic change, but none of our 
iotests caught it, so we're also missing test coverage.

I'm working on adding 'nbd_opt_list_meta_context()' to libnbd, which 
will add testsuite coverage of this.

Ultimately, we want something like:

if starts with "base:":
   if nothing else:
     if list mode:
       return "base:allocation"
     else:
       return empty list
   else if "base:allocation":
     return "base:allocation"
   else
     return empty list
else if starts with "qemu:":
   if nothing else:
     if list mode:
       return all possible sub-qemu contexts
     else:
       return empty list
   else if starts with "qemu:dirty-bitmap:":
     if nothing else:
       if list mode:
         return all possible dirty-bitmap contexts (right now, just one,
             but I want to allow an array of bitmaps in the future)
       else:
         return empty list
     else if exact match:
       return that bitmap
     else:
       return empty list
   else if "qemu:allocation-depth" (from next patch):
     return "allocation-depth"
   else:
     return empty list
else:
   return empty list

Maybe some function renames will help.

I'll separate it.

I'll see what parts of that I can use in v2.
