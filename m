This is actually not related to the patch.  It doesn't touch
file-descriptors at all, only fdset IDs.

But let's discuss file descriptors briefly.

File descriptors are plain int.  There is no QAPI type corresponding to
plain int.

I guess plain int is 32 bits wide on all hosts we support.  Narrower int
(permitted by the standard) wouldn't fly with QEMU.  Wider int should,
and are theoretically possible.

I'm not sure we want to change the QAPI schema.

Even if we had wider file descriptors: a billion fdsets should be enough
for anyone.

What exactly is wrong with the patch?

It changes the return value of monitor_fdset_dup_fd_find_remove() and
monitor_fdset_dup_fd_find() from int to int64_t.  Both return an fdset
ID (a MonFdset member @id, of type int64_t) on success, -1 on error.
The change removes a truncation from int64_t to int in
monitor_fdset_dup_fd_find_remove(), and a widening from int to int64_t
in qemu_close().

I believe the patch is fine as is.  Another patch that changes fdset IDs
from int64_t to int32_t would also be fine, but it would Require
tracking down all the places to change.
