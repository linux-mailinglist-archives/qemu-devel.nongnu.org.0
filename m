I realize this is an extremely dense section that actually covers a
*lot* of pathways.

sync_bitmap: This is used as an initial manifest for which sectors to
copy out. It is the user-provided bitmap. We actually *never* edit this
bitmap in the body of the job.

copy_bitmap: This is the manifest for which blocks remain to be copied
out. We clear bits in this as we go, because we use it as our loop
condition.

So what you say is actually only half-true: the sync_bitmap actually
remains static during the duration of the job, and it has an anonymous
child that accrues new writes. This is a holdover from before we had a
copy_bitmap, and we used to use a sync_bitmap directly as our loop
condition.

(This could be simplified upstream at present; but after this patch it
cannot be for reasons explained below. We do wish to maintain three
distinct sets of bits:
1. The bits at the start of the operation,
2. The bits accrued during the operation, and
3. The bits that remain to be, or were not, copied during the operation.)

So there's actually three bitmaps:

- sync_bitmap: actually just static and read-only
- sync_bitmap's anonymous child: accrues new writes.
- copy_bitmap: loop conditional.

>=20

The new dirty bits were accrued very secretly in the anonymous child.
The new dirty bits are merged in via the reclaim() function.

So, what happens is:

- Sync_bitmap gets the bit pattern of copy_bitmap (one way or another)
- Sync_bitmap reclaims (merges with) its anonymous child.

>=20

You might have slightly the wrong idea; it's important to keep track of
what was dirtied during the operation because that data is important for
the next bitmap backup.

The merging of "sectors left to copy" (in the case of a failed backup)
and "sectors dirtied since we started the operation" forms the actual
minimal set needed to re-write to this target to achieve a new
functioning point in time. This is what you get with the "always" mode
in a failure case.

In a success case, it just so happens that "sectors left to copy" is the
empty set.

It's like an incremental on top of the incremental.

Consider this:

We have a 4TB drive and we have dirtied 3TB of it since our full backup.
We copy out 2TB as part of a new incremental backup before suffering
some kind of failure.

Today, you'd need to start a new incremental backup that copies that
entire 3TB *plus* whatever was dirtied since the job failed.

With this mode, you'd only need to copy the remaining 1TB + whatever was
dirtied since.

So, what this logic is really doing is:

If we failed, OR if we want the "never" sync policy:

Merge the anonymous child (bits written during op) back into sync_bitmap
(bits we were instructed to copy), leaving us as if we have never
started this operation.

If, however, we failed and we have the "always" sync policy, we destroy
the sync_bitmap (bits we were instructed to copy) and replace it with
the copy_bitmap (bits remaining to copy). Then, we merge that with the
anonymous child (bits written during op).

Or, in success cases (when sync policy is not never), we simply delete
the sync_bitmap (bits we were instructed to copy) and replace it with
its anonymous child (bits written during op).
