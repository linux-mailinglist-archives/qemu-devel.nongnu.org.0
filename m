Knowing that a file reads as all zeroes when created is useful, but
limited in scope to drivers that can create images.  However, there
are also situations where pre-existing images can quickly be
determined to read as all zeroes, even when the image was not just
created by the same process.  The optimization used in qemu-img
convert to avoid a pre-zeroing pass on the destination is just as
useful in such a scenario.  As such, it is worth the block layer
adding another bit to bdrv_known_zeroes().

Note that while BDRV_ZERO_CREATE cannot chase through backing layers
(because it only applies at creation time, but the backing layer was
not created at the same time as the active layer being created), it IS
okay for BDRV_ZERO_OPEN to chase through layers (as long as all layers
currently read as zero, the image reads as zero).

Upcoming patches will update the qcow2, file-posix, and nbd drivers to
advertise the new bit when appropriate.
