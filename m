V2:
- Various minor issues found by Philippe, see individual patches.
  Note that the const_le64() patch matches changes in a set of Philippe's that was
  never applied. Philippe may send an update of that series before this merges.
  If that occurs, drop "qemu/bswap: Add const_le64()"
- Picked up tags.

V1 Cover letter.

A small collection of misc fixes and tidying up pulled out from various
series. I've pulled this to the top of my queue of CXL related work
as they stand fine on their own and it will reduce the noise in
the larger patch sets if these go upstream first.

Gregory's patches were posted as part of his work on adding volatile support.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20221006233702.18532-1-gregory.price@memverge.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20221128150157.97724-2-gregory.price@memverge.com/
I might propose this for upstream inclusion this cycle, but testing is
currently limited by lack of suitable kernel support.

Ira's patches were part of his event injection series.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/20221221-ira-cxl-events-2022-11-17-v2-0-2ce2ecc06219@intel.com/
Intent is to propose for upstream the rest of that series shortly after
some minor changes from earlier review.

My three patches have not previously been posted.

For the curious, the current state of QEMU CXL emulation that we are working
through the backlog wrt to final cleanup before proposing for upstreaming can be found at.
