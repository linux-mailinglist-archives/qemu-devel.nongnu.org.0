Or maybe:

Additional options include ``-g`` which sets a non-default *GRANULARITY* 
for ``--add``, and ``-b`` and ``-F`` which select an alternative source 
file for all *SOURCE* bitmaps used by ``--merge``.

And in writing this, I just realized - even though you _can_ use --add 
more than once in a command line, the command is still limited to 
operating on a single bitmap name, so unless you write contortions like:

qemu-img bitmap --add --remove --add -g 1024 file.qcow2 bitmapname

there will normally be at most one --add operation for a -g to be used 
with (because otherwise the second --add will fail when attempting to 
create an already-existing bitmap name).
