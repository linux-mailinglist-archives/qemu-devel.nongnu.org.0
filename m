I would say yes, but I can't really be bothered arguing it upstream.

Well, maybe.  We can supply the anonymized host identifier through
/etc/machine-id (already used by Openstack on x86), and I guess we can
present it to the guest via this get-vpd interface.  Heaven knows what
to do about caching / notifications, since in the qemu model (unlike
the PAPR / pHyp model) the guest is not aware of migrations.

Well, maybe.

Right, but do license systems need the model as well?  I can't see why
they would.
