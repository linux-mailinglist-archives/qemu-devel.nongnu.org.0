I gave it a try, but either I'm doing something wrong, or it is not
possible to run multiple FreeBSD tasks on cirrus-ci for one commit -
either the second task does not show up, or both FreeBSD tasks do not
show up here. I assume there are some limitations in place (see
https://cirrus-ci.org/faq/#are-there-any-limits), but it even does not
work for me when I limit the number of cpus in the tasks to a lower
value like 4 or 2.

Could somebody else please have a try? Maybe I'm just doing something
stupid here...

 Thomas
