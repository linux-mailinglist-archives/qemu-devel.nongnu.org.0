The easy way out would be tying libvirt to a specific QEMU version. And
I'm only half joking.

If libvirt didn't exist yet and we needed a management library for QEMU,
what we would build now would probably not look much like libvirt looks
today. We wouldn't try to have basic support for every hypervisor out
there, but integrate it much closer with QEMU and avoid much of the
backwards compatibility requirements that the interface between QEMU and
libvirt has (which requires us to deal with compatibility twice for
everything).

Maybe it would even be part of the QEMU repository, allowing a single
patch series to implement a new feature in the system emulator and
expose it in the API immediately instead of waiting for the next QEMU
release before libvirt can even think about implementing support for it.

So should libvirt move in that direction? Do people actually still make
much use of its multi-hypervisor nature, or would it make sense to split
it into separate libraries for each hypervisor that can be much tighter
integrated with (a specific version of) the respective hypervisor?
