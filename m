Maybe a nice idea, but I think this is out of scope for this patch
series. We're using the "if ! truncate --size=3D4G" check in some other
tests already, so I'm not adding some new mechanism here.
If you want to see some more fine-grained control for the iotests,
please send some patches to rework these other tests first.
