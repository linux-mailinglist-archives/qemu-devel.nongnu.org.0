Did you see any speed-up? I had a look at some pipelines, and it seems 
to me that they rather got slower now? For example, this is the system1 
pipeline before your change:

  https://gitlab.com/huth/qemu/-/jobs/610924897

and after your change:

  https://gitlab.com/huth/qemu/-/jobs/611069374

Duration went up from 35 minutes to 42 minutes.

Seems also to happen in your builds, before the change:

  https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/582995084

and after the change:

  https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/606175927

... went from 36 minutes up to 42 minutes.

Could be a coincidence due to the load on the shared runners, but it 
looks at least a little bit suspicious...
