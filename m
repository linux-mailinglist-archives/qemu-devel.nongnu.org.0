My assumption was that we would attack this by:
 * converting chunks of the documentation which are in qemu-doc.texi
   but which aren't in the qemu.1 manpage (basically in the way this
   series is doing)
 * get the qapidoc generation conversion reviewed and into
   master (since at the moment it outputs into files included
   from qemu-doc)
 * convert the manpage parts; we have the machinery for dealing
   with the hxtool files, it just needs a little more work

This ought to make it easier to do the conversion of the
various subparts, right?

Incidentally:
> makeinfo -o - --docbook security.texi  | pandoc -f docbook -t rst

security texi was the really easy one here. I had to do more
manual formatting fixups on qemu-deprecated.texi which I'm
sceptical would have worked out as nicely done automatically.

The automatic conversion rune also doesn't seem to get quotes
and apostrophes right: it has turned "guest B's disk image" into
something with a smartquote character in it, for instance.
