I think the series you've posted should be enough to see VMBus in the
DeviceManager.  hv-scsi and hv-net should not further depend on ACPI.
hv-pci does: it (at least in its Linux driver implementation) wants the
VMBus entry or any of its ancestors to define range(s) where mmio
windows can be placed.  This may be worth considering when deciding
where to stick the VMBus entry to.

Thanks,
Roman.
