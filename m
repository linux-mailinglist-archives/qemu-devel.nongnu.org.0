Dave, many thanks for your input. I would be interested to read up that
discussion you hand for POWER to try to catch the train of thought. Can
you give me a pointer?

My current understanding is that s390x already has the "allow PV" option,
which is the CPU model feature. But its dynamics is just like the
dynamics of other CPU model features, in a sense that you may have to
disable it explicitly.

Our problem is, that iommu_platform=3Don comes at a price point for us,
and we don't want to enforce it when it is not needed. And if the guest
does not decide to do the transition to protected, it is not needed.

Thus any scheme were we pessimise based on the sheer possibility of
protected virtualization seems wrong to me.

The sad thing is that QEMU has every information it needs to do what is
best: for paravirtualized devices
* use F_ACCESS_PLATFORM when needed, to make the guest work harder and
work around the access restrictions imposed by memory protection, and=20
* don't use F_ACCESS_PLATFORM when when not needed, and allow for
  optimization based on the fact that no such access restrictions exist.

Sure we can burden up the user, to tell us if the VM is intended to be
used with memory protection or not. But what does it buy us? The
opportunity to create dodgy configurations?

Regards,
Halil
