Guilty as charged...  I was happy with the contents you provided (and
grateful for it), but our parallel work caused some redundancy.  I went
beyond a minimal merge to get a something that reads as one coherent
text.

I can duplicate the advice from the paragraph preceding it, like this:

     * This is rarely needed.  When @err is a local variable, use of
     * ERRP_GUARD() commonly results in more readable code.
     * Where it is needed, it is more concise than
     *     error_propagate(errp, err); // don't do this
     *     error_prepend(errp, "Could not frobnicate '%s': ", name);
     * and works even when @errp is &error_fatal.

Yes, but I trust the reader can make that mental jump.

I didn't think of this.

What about

     * To convert a function to use ERRP_GUARD(), assuming the local
     * variable it propagates to @errp is called @err:
     [...]
     * 2. Replace &err by errp, and err by *errp.  Delete local variable
     *    @err if it s now unused.

Nope, still no good, if we replace like that, @err *will* be unused, and
the locally handled error will leak to the caller.

No time left for wordsmithing; let's improve on top.
