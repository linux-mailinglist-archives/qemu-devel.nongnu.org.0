Hi Alex,

agree with the sentiment, for cpus.c I would suggest cpus_ though.

There are otherwise so many cpu_ functions and cpu.c modules.. using cpus_ would help a lot to understand that it is part of softmmu/cpus.c

Wdyt?

Also cpus.c contains a lot of qemu_ that is not used to wrap standard library functions.

After the current cpus refactoring, I could take care of improving the naming conventions in cpus.c

Thanks,

Claudio
