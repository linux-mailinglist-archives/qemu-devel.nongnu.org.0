Of course there were bugs fixed by switching to ACPI, but we'd
lived with native hotplug in production and the majority of
the time it worked as users needed. The bugs were edge cases
essentially only affecting a small subset of users.

The switch to ACPI broke the out of the box configuration for
used by OpenStack. That's not an edge case, that's a serious
impact.

I consider it to be fixing a serious regression by going back
to a known working safe impl, that has been used in production
successfully for a long time. We know there are bugs with
native hotplug, but they're *known* problems.

The unsual thing about timing is having a major functional
regression identified in the previous release and then not
even having patches propposed to fix it until after soft
freeze for the next release arrives :-(

It doesn't give a feeling of confidence, but makes me
wonder what other *unknown* problems we're liable to hit
still.

Regards,
Daniel
