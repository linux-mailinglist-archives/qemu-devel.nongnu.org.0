Yeah, this stuff is also broken with Linux under Hyper-V IIRC (I
remember fixing kdump/makedumpfile to not touch inflated pages).

One idea is to notify the host like "I'll reuse any page again". But
doing that via virtio while your dying isn't always possible. So the new
kernel would have to do it - but then virtio-balloon would have to be up
and running extremely early during boot, before any possibly-inflated
page gets touched - also a head scratcher. Then, what if your new kernel
doesn't support virtio-balloon ... not easy.

Yes, and there were RFCs already.

Not if they are fundamental. Try implementing vfio support for memory
ballooning, you're going to have a hard time.

I disagree, but that's a different discussion. :)

Right, or even bigger, depending on the setup.

Yeah, hot-removing a virtio-mem device is not one of the important use
cases (it's completely blocked). If you want to unplug memory, adjust
the requested size.

There are plans to support it in the future (for example during reboot),
but I barely see a need for it currently (especially once we support
resizeable memory backends upstream).

Right, that was a decision to avoid issues known from base-page-size
based ballooning (like fragmenting guest memory, big tracking bitmaps,
incompatibility with vfio, breaking THP and degrading performance,
incompatibility with hugetlbfs ...)

Yeah, I had the same thought back when designing virtio-mem (and looking
into similar handling), but decided that it's impossible to get right -
at least in NUMA setups (and regarding migration). But I can see that
Hyper-V Dynamic Memory doesn't care too much about NUMA at all (and
NUMA-aware ballooning has its own set of issues).

Yes. It's really something in-between memory ballooning and DIMM-based
memory hot(un)plug. The block size will be comparatively large in some
setups (esp., with vfio). You're definitely not able to squeeze out the
page of your guest - we have virtio-balloon for that if one really wants
to do that - not the target use case of virtio-mem.

Yes, until we have support for it.

All I can say is, that there are (unofficial?) APIs :) (e.g., the ones
used by DM). But yeah, that's what you get with closed-source operating
systems - and personally, I think, it shouldn't be us that have to suffer.

Yeah, but then there are things like

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200107130950.2983-1-Tianyu.Lan@microsoft.com

that left me clueless - it seems like we're missing some things, maybe
there is more (I am pretty sure there is more ... :) )? (I do some work
on the Linux hv_balloon driver every now of then when working on
optimizing the other balloon drivers / virtio-mem).

I'll try to give your series a look. I can definitely say that

1) I dislike that an external entity has to do vDIMM adaptions /
ballooning adaptions when rebooting or when wanting to resize a guest.

2) I am not sure ignoring the kvm memory slot limit is a good idea. (or
the fundamental issue of resizing boot memory - ever)

Once you have the current approach upstream (vDIMMs, ballooning), there
is no easy way to change that later (requires deprecating, etc.).

But we talked about that already.
