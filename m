I don't think this is only the test suite. I think it will affect all the
binaries we build

The only way you can force it is to use -Wl,--whole-archive arg to tell l=
d
to include everything from libqemuutil.la, but that will break the way
the stubs work, as we want make of the stubs to be discarded.

The only other option is to not build $(crypto-obj-y) into libqemuutil.la=
,
but list that variable explicitly everywhere that we list libqemuutil.la

Daniel
