Changes since v5:
  * Disable runtime altivec detection until all of the required
    opcodes are implemented.
    Because dup2 was last, that really means all of the pure altivec
    bits, so the initial patches are not bisectable in any meaningful
    sense.  I thought about reshuffling dup2 earlier, but that created
    too many conflicts and I was too lazy.
  * Rearranged the patches a little bit to make sure that each
    one actually builds, which was not the case before.
  * Folded in the fix to tcg_out_mem_long, as discussed in the
    followup within the v4 thread.

Changes since v4:
  * Patch 1, "tcg/ppc: Introduce Altivec registers", is divided into
    ten smaller patches.
  * The net result (code-wise) is not changed between former patch 1
    and ten new patches.
  * Remaining (2-7) patches from v4 are applied verbatim.
  * This means that code-wise v5 and v4 do not differ.
  * v5 is devised to help debugging, and to better organize the code.

Changes since v3:
  * Add support for bitsel, with the vsx xxsel insn.
  * Rely on the new relocation overflow handling, so
    we don't require 3 insns for a vector load.

Changes since v2:
  * Several generic tcg patches to improve dup vs dupi vs dupm.
    In particular, if a global temp (like guest r10) is not in
    a host register, we should duplicate from memory instead of
    loading to an integer register, spilling to stack, loading
    to a vector register, and then duplicating.
  * I have more confidence that 32-bit ppc host should work
    this time around.  No testing on that front yet, but I've
    unified some code sequences with 64-bit ppc host.
  * Base altivec now supports V128 only.  Moved V64 support to
    Power7 (v2.06), which has 64-bit load/store.
  * Dropped support for 64-bit vector multiply using Power8.
    The expansion was too large compared to using integer regs.
