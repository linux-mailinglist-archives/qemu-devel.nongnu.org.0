hmm, I'm not sure. so your expectation is silently dropping guest writes
without any bus error, right?

it's not a ROM, but a ram region backed by a device. we wish this region
to be read-only sometimes, in order to implement some useful features.
It can be a virtual BAR region in a virtual mdev device.

currently, vfio implements the BAR regions in two types:
1. non-mmap'd,  meaning this region will not be added into kvm memory
slots, and whenever guest accesses it, it will be trapped into a host
handler. we do the read-only check in patch 2 of this series.
2. mmap'd, meaning this region will be added into kvm memory slots, and
guest could access it without any hypervisor intervening.
so without patch 3 in the series, there's no write protection to guest
writes.
after setting this mmap'd region to read-only in patch 3, the
corresponding memory slot in kvm is set to read-only, so only guest
writes would be trapped into host, i.e. into the
memory_region_ram_device_write(). guest reads is still within the guest
without hypervisor intervening.

there might be other MRs that require checking of read-only-ness.
but their handlers have the right to be called to know it has happened,
and they might want to do some special handling of it. That's why I did
not put the check in general dispatcher.
