This should be:

   :avocado: tags=3Dslow,arch:x86_64,machine:q35

That is, the separator of key/val is ':', because the equal sign is
used to separate the docstring directive type (here it's "tags") from
their content.  `avocado list -V` should show you the tag keys with
all their values inside a parenthesis.  That is, for the following
docstring directive:

   :avocado: tags=3Dslow,arch:x86_64,machine:q35,machine:pc

You'd get:

   slow,arch(x86_64),machine(q35,pc)

Don't be, because you did check it. :)

I was thinking of *this* test setUp(), not avocado_qemu.Test.setUp().

Anyway, looking at the other options we talked about, I was able to
boot a vmlinux image from a "mainstream distro" kernel package[1] that
already has CONFIG_PVH enabled[2] with recent QEMU (and also tested
that I wasn't able to do so with older QEMU).  Other distros also
provide a vmlinux image, but as part of the debuginfo packages and
they can be HUGE, so not recommended here.

If we go with this route, compilation would be a non-issue, and this
test would be just like the other "boot_linux_console.py" tests.

Right.  But even though this test can be proven stable (I can't
disprove it), we also have to watch for the overall user experience.
Like I've said before, I don't think users running this test are
interested in building a kernel, but asserting a QEMU feature, and
that can be a source of "test distrust" IMO.

Please let me know what you think of reusing an available kernel instead
of building one.

Cheers,
