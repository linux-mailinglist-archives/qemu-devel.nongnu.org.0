Also needs

   @item @code{Cascadelake-Server}

We already talk about this later on we I thin kwe can trim the
/proc/cpinfo bit

I think we can simplify this a little - we don't need to talk
about CPU steppings - the user simply needs to know whether the
sysfs file reports vulnerable or not.

So perhaps this text:

  Recommended to inform the guest OS that the host is @i{not]
  vulnerable to any of the MDS variants ([MFBDS]
  CVE-2018-12130, [MLPDS] CVE-2018-12127, [MSBDS] CVE-2018-12126).

  This is a MSR feature rather than a CPUID feature, so will not
  appear in the Linux @code{/proc/cpuinfo} in the host or guest.

  It should only be enabled for VMs if the host reports
  @code{Not affected} in the
  @code{/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds} file.

Daniel
