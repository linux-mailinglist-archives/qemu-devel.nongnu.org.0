Huh, I didn't even realize that.  What's the mechanism?

Igor,

It's kind of difficult to answer that question - PAPR doesn't
specifically describe limitations, it's just that the representation
it uses is inherently limited.  Instead of the obvious, simple and
pretty much universal method (used in the generic kernel and qemu) of
having a matrix of distance between all the nodes, it instead
describes the hierarchy of components that give rise to the different
distances.

So, for each NUMA relevant object (cpu, memory block, host bridge,
etc.) there is a vector of IDs.  Each number in the vector gives one
level of the objects location in the heirarchy.

So, for example the first number might be the physical chip/socket.
the second one which group of cores & memory interfaces sharing an Ln
cache, the third one the specific core number.  So to work out how far
objects are from each other you essentially look at how long a prefix
of their vector they share, which tells you how far above in the
hierarchy you have to go to reach it.

There's a bunch of complicating details, but that's the gist of it.
