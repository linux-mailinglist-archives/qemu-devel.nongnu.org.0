Indeed it doesn't use _all_ of the QAPI goodies.  It does use visitors
and it's a major feature of QOM.

It's verbose in the getters/setters, but we have wrappers such as
object_property_set_str, object_property_set_bool etc. that do not make
it too hard to understand.

QOM didn't only replace qdev: it also removed the need to have a command
line option du jour for any new concept, e.g. all the TLS stuff, RNG
backends, RAM backends, etc.

It didn't succeed (at all) in deprecating chardev/netdev/device etc.,
but this is a very underappreciated part of QOM, and this is why I think
it's appropriate to say QOM is "C with classes and CLI/RPC
serialization", as opposed for example to "C with classes and multi
programming language interface" that is GObject.

That's at least plausible.  But I have a nagging feeling that it would
only cover 99% of what we're doing with QOM. :)
