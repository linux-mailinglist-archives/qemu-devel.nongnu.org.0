> +Reporting Security Bugs
> +-----------------------
> +For details on how to report security bugs or ask questions about
> potential
> +security bugs, see the `Security Process wiki page
> +<https://wiki.qemu.org/SecurityProcess>`_.
> +
> +General Secure C Coding Practices
> +---------------------------------
> +Most CVEs (security bugs) reported against QEMU are not specific to
> +virtualization or emulation.  They are simply C programming bugs.
> Therefore
> +it's critical to be aware of common classes of security bugs.
> +
> +There is a wide selection of resources available covering secure C
> coding.  For
> +example, the `CERT C Coding Standard
> +<https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standar=
d
> >`_
> +covers the most important classes of security bugs.
> +
> +Instead of describing them in detail here, only the names of the most
> important
> +classes of security bugs are mentioned:
> +
> +* Buffer overflows
> +* Use-after-free and double-free
> +* Integer overflows
> +* Format string vulnerabilities
> +
> +Some of these classes of bugs can be detected by analyzers.  Static
> analysis is
> +performed regularly by Coverity and the most obvious of these bugs are
> even
> +reported by compilers.  Dynamic analysis is possible with valgrind, tsan=
,
> and
> +asan.
> +
> +Input Validation
> +----------------
> +Inputs from the guest or external sources (e.g. network, files) cannot b=
e
> +trusted and may be invalid.  Inputs must be checked before using them in
> a way
> +that could crash the program, expose host memory to the guest, or
> otherwise be
> +exploitable by an attacker.
> +
> +The most sensitive attack surface is device emulation.  All hardware
> register
> +accesses and data read from guest memory must be validated.  A typical
> example
> +is a device that contains multiple units that are selectable by the gues=
t
> via
> +an index register::
> +
> +  typedef struct {
> +      ProcessingUnit unit[2];
> +      ...
> +  } MyDeviceState;
> +
> +  static void mydev_writel(void *opaque, uint32_t addr, uint32_t val)
> +  {
> +      MyDeviceState *mydev =3D opaque;
> +      ProcessingUnit *unit;
> +
> +      switch (addr) {
> +      case MYDEV_SELECT_UNIT:
> +          unit =3D &mydev->unit[val];   <-- this input wasn't validated!
> +          ...
> +      }
> +  }
> +
> +If ``val`` is not in range [0, 1] then an out-of-bounds memory access
> will take
> +place when ``unit`` is dereferenced.  The code must check that ``val`` i=
s
> 0 or
> +1 and handle the case where it is invalid.
> +
> +Unexpected Device Accesses
> +--------------------------
> +The guest may access device registers in unusual orders or at unexpected
> +moments.  Device emulation code must not assume that the guest follows t=
he
> +typical "theory of operation" presented in driver writer manuals.  The
> guest
> +may make nonsense accesses to device registers such as starting operatio=
ns
> +before the device has been fully initialized.
> +
> +A related issue is that device emulation code must be prepared for
> unexpected
> +device register accesses while asynchronous operations are in progress. =
 A
> +well-behaved guest might wait for a completion interrupt before accessin=
g
> +certain device registers.  Device emulation code must handle the case
> where the
> +guest overwrites registers or submits further requests before an ongoing
> +request completes.  Unexpected accesses must not cause memory corruption
> or
> +leaks in QEMU.
> +
> +Invalid device register accesses can be reported with
> +``qemu_log_mask(LOG_GUEST_ERROR, ...)``.  The ``-d guest_errors``
> command-line
> +option enables these log messages.
> +
> +Live Migration
> +--------------
> +Device state can be saved to disk image files and shared with other user=
s.
> +Live migration code must validate inputs when loading device state so an
> +attacker cannot gain control by crafting invalid device states.  Device
> state
> +is therefore considered untrusted even though it is typically generated
> by QEMU
> +itself.
> +
> +Guest Memory Access Races
> +-------------------------
> +Guests with multiple vCPUs may modify guest RAM while device emulation
> code is
> +running.  Device emulation code must copy in descriptors and other guest
> RAM
> +structures and only process the local copy.  This prevents
> +time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions that could cause
> QEMU to
> +crash when a vCPU thread modifies guest RAM while device emulation is
> +processing it.
