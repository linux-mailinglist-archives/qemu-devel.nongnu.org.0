Will do and thank you for taking a look at this!

I was trying to return a media error, like a 3/1101 for SCSI device.  I
think that is at the ATA level?

Correct, but for trying out a simple read on a SATA drive for Linux I
end up here first :-)  Well, until the kernel retries a number of times
and finally gives up and returns an error while also disabling NCQ for
the device.

As I mentioned above, return an unrecoverable media error.

SCSI sense data can report the first sector in error and I thought I
could do the same for SATA too?

I totally agree.

I started out using integers in the call for error_in_read, as that is
what SCSI uses internally for wwn.  Then I did NVMe and it's using a
string that doesn't apparently need to be an integer for the wwn? so I
changed it to being a string to accommodate.

I also find it interesting that when a SATA device wwid is dumped out
within the guest it doesn't appear to have any correlation with the wwn
that was passed in on the command line, eg.

-device ide-drive,drive=satadisk,bus=ahci.0,wwn=8675309

$cat /sys/block/sda/device/wwid
t10.ATA     QEMU HARDDISK                           QM00005


This does correlate for SCSI

-device scsi-hd,drive=hd,wwn=12345678

$ cat /sys/block/sdc/device/wwid
naa.0000000000bc614e


as 0xbc614e = 12345678


For NVMe, the wwn is in the wwid, but it's not immediately obvious.

Being able to correlate between the command line and what you find in
the guest would be good.

Yes, goal was to be able to selectively pick one or more specific block
devices and then create one or more block errors on each device with
potentially different error behavior for each block in error.
