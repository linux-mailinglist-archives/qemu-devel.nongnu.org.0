I wonder if it wouldn't make more sense to pass a BlockDriverState
instead of a filename. In the create options we usually have a BDS
around, so it should be possible to use.

The only case where it wouldn't work is if creating the image file
worked, but bdrv_open() fails. I think this is unlikely, and it's even
more unlikely that unlinking such a file would then work, so I wouldn't
see it as a problem.

The reason why I'm suggesting this is that we've spent a lot of time in
the past years to change open and create to an interface that doesn't
use only filenames, because filenames cover only part of the possibe
block devices.

So I'm kind of hesitant to add a new interface that can only use
filenames, while we know that filenames just don't quite cut it in the
general case - especially if using a BDS, which already has all the
information needed, is possible as an alternative.

This hunk isn't generic, it belong in file-posix.c
