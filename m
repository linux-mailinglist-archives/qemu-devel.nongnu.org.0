I don't have definitive answers so these are some ideas but I may be 
completely wrong.

I don't know about Solaris but what I've seen on PPC and via-ide is that 
it works until switched to UDMA mode then it freezes on the first command 
issued after switching to UDMA so it seems like it expects an interrupt 
that's not generated or not routed correctly but only in DMA mode, in the 
initial PIO mode it works. Not sure if this is useful at all for your case 
though so you may just disregard it.

I think the syncing was added in commit 271dddd1 and the commit log:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2014-08/msg02644.html

cites the data sheet for that and there were other commits around it that 
were changing similar things as well. I guess this was fixing some problem 
at the time (Mark may remember more) so maybe these are correct but I 
don't know what actual hardware does. I also remember this IDE controller 
chip had different versions with early ones having implementation bugs 
that could cause problems so people generally avoided it or drivers may 
have hacks to fix those so it's possible that this tries to work around 
some hardware bug? I don't remember the details but maybe Linux kernel 
source has some history on this.

I'm not sure either because during testing I've seen two cases and in one 
IRQ was raised but did not reach CPU due to being masked in interrupt 
controller so that suggests it's not a problem with generating the IRQ in 
IDE code but problem is afterwards but still could not understand why it 
fails. (Seems to work on Linux though so maybe understanding what the 
working and non-working cases do differently could get closer to the 
answer.)

I can only guess. The data sheet says that in PCI native mode these bits 
should be checked to determine if an interrupt on PCI INTA is coming from 
this controller (but for PIO mode, for DMA it just refers to Intel's spec 
without any more info). Specifically:

"When an IDE port is in PCI IDE Native Mode, the IDE task file registers 
may be mapped to non-standard port addresses, and IDE drive interrupts 
occur at PCI INTA. [As opposed to Legacy mode when it uses standard ISA 
IDE port numbers and IRQ14 and 15.] Therefore, if both IDE ports are in 
PCI IDE Native Mode, drive interrupts from both IDE ports are multiplexed 
into PCI INTA. In this case, the interrupt status bits must be polled to 
determine which IDE port generated the interrupt, or whether the interrupt 
was generated by another PCI device sharing INTA on the bus.

1) The host reads CFR (index 50h). If bit 2 is set, then the interrupt 
occurred on the primary IDE port.

2) The host reads ARTTIM23. If bit 4 is set, then the interrupt occurred 
on the secondary IDE port.

3) If 1) and 2) are both false, then the interrupt was generated by 
another PCI device sharing INTA with the PCI0646."

As for why it polls this reg, if it's not expecting interrupt on primary 
port and just reading both as described above, it may be expecting more 
interrupts than QEMU is generating or it may expect them to arrive with 
some delay or after previous one is cleared that QEMU could just raise 
once due to being faster or doing something differently? Does someone know 
what interrupts are generated on real hardware in DMA mode so we can 
compare that to what we see with QEMU?
