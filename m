You're correct that successes and failures on those tests depend
largely on bandwith.  On a shared environment I used for tests
the download of those images take roughly 400 seconds, resulting
in failures.  On my own machine, around 60, and the tests pass.

There's a conceptual and conflicting problem in that the environment
for tests to run should be prepared beforehand.  The conflicting
solutions can be:

 * extensive bootstrapping of the test execution environment, such
   as the installation of guests from ISOs or installation trees, or
   the download of "default" images wether the tests will use it or
   not (this is what Avocado-VT does/requires)

 * keeping test assets in the tree (Avocado allows this if you have
   a your_test.py.data/ directory), but it's not practical for large
   files or files that can't or shouldn't be redistributed

On Avocado version 72.0 we attempted to minimize the isse by
implementing a "vmimage" command.  So, if you expect to use Fedora 30
aarch64 images, you could run before your tests:

 $ avocado vmimage get --distro fedora --distro-version 30 --arch aarch64

And to list the images on your cache:

 $ avocado vmimage list

Unfortunately, this test doesn't use the vmimage API.  Actually that
is fine because not all test assets map nicely to the vmimage goal,
and should keep using the more generic (and lower level) fetch_asset().

We're now working on various "asset fetcher" improvements that should
allow us to check/cache all assets before a test is executed.  Also,
we're adding a mode in which the "fetch_asset()" API will default to
cancel (aka SKIP) a test if the asset could not be downloaded.

If you're interested in the card we're using to track that new feature:

  https://trello.com/c/T3SC1sZs/1521-implement-fetch-assets-command-line-parameter

Another possibility that we've prototyped, and we'll be working on
further, is to make a specific part of the "test" code execution
(really a pre-test phase) to be executed without a timeout and even be
tried a number of times before bailing out and skipping the test.

I've schedulled a 100 executions of `make check-acceptance` builds, with
the linux_ssh_mips_malta.py tests having a 1500 seconds timeout.  The
very first execution already brought interesting results:

 ...
 (15/39) /home/cleber/src/qemu/tests/acceptance/linux_ssh_mips_malta.py:LinuxSSH.test_mips_malta32eb_kernel3_2_0: PASS (198.38 s)
 (16/39) /home/cleber/src/qemu/tests/acceptance/linux_ssh_mips_malta.py:LinuxSSH.test_mips_malta64el_kernel3_2_0: FAIL: Failure message found in console: Oops (22.83 s)

I'll let you know about my full results.  This should also serve as a
starting point to a discussion about the reliability of other tests,
as you mentioned before.

In my experience, and backed by the executions on Travis, most tests
have been really stable on x86_64 hosts.  Last week I've worked in
ppc64 and aarch64 hosts, and posted a number of patches addressing
the failures I found.  I'll compile a list of the posted patches and
their status.

Thanks for reporting those issues.
