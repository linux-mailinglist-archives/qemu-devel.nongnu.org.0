So QEMU reading stuff sent by libvirt in a back compatible manner is
ok. The problem was specifically when a QEMU reply sent back UINT64_MAX
value as a positive number.

I don't particularly want us to rely on semantics of small known set
of JSON libs. I really do want us to do something that is capable of
working with any JSON impl that exists in any programming language.

My suggested option 2 & 3 at least would manage that I believe, as
any credible JSON impl will be able to represent 32-bit integers
or strings without loosing data.

Option 1 would not cope as some impls can't even cope with
signed 64-bit ints.

But will still fail with any JSON impl that uses double precision floating
point for integers as it will loose precision.

> Option 2 feels ugliest.  Less simple, more interoperable than option 1.

If we assume any JSON impl can do 32-bit integers without loss of
precision, then I think we can say it is guaranteed portable, but
it is certainly horrible / ugly.

> Option 3 is like option 2, just not quite as ugly.

I think option 3 can be guaranteed to be loss-less with /any/ JSON impl
that exists, since you're delegating all string -> int conversion to
the application code taking the JSON parser/formatter out of the equation.

This is close to the approach libvirt takes with YAJL parser today. YAJL
parses as a int64 and we then ignore its result, and re-parse the string
again in libvirt as uint64. When generating json we format as uint64
in libvirt and ignore YAJLs formatting for int64.

> Can we agree to eliminate option 2 from the race?

I'm fine with eliminating option 2.

I guess I'd have a preference for option 3 given that it has better
interoperability
