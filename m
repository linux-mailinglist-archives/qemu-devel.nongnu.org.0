i386 is 32bits, so int is 32bits O:-)
I really hope that we would never, ever, need a 64bits instance id.
It would mean that we have more than 2.000.000.000 objects of the same
type, no?

I am pretty sure than in 16bits platforms we have other problems than
insntance_id (namely that we don't have enough memory).

Later, Juan.
