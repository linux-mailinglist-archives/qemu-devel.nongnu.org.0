Which makes me inclined to keep the get/put register code the way it is
in this patch, at least with regards to the hard coded number of slices
and the build-bug. The way it's written (to me) serves to document the
state of things, rather than truly implement anything, but also (to me)
it's easier to understand that code than would be a couple of paragraphs
of actual documentation trying to explain it.

We do need to use/swap-to host-endian when we implement the monitor's
dump-guest-memory command, at it also creates ELF notes for the general
and VFP (and, coming soon, SVE) registers. Implementing those ELF notes
for SVE is on my TODO, right after this series.

Thanks,
