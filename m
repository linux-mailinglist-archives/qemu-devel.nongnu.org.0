The flipside is that MAKE_ERRP_SAFE hides a bunch of logic, so you don't
really know what its doing without looking at it, and this is QEMU
custom concept so one more thing to learn for new contributors.

While I think it is a nice trick, personally I think we would be better
off if we simply used a code pattern which does not require de-referencing
'errp' at all, aside from exceptional cases. IOW, no added macro in 95%
of all our methods using Error **errp.

There are lots of neat things we could do with auto-cleanup functions we
I think we need to be wary of hiding too much cleverness behind macros
when doing so overall.

Daniel
