I received an off-list report of failure to connect to an NBD server
expecting an x509 certificate, when the client was attempting something
similar to this command line:

$ ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -name 'blah' -machine q35 -nodefaul=
ts \
  -object tls-creds-x509,id=3Dtls0,endpoint=3Dclient,dir=3D$path_to_certs=

  -device scsi-hd,id=3Dimage1,drive=3Ddrive_image1,bootindex=3D0
qemu-system-x86_64: -drive id=3Ddrive_image1,if=3Dnone,snapshot=3Doff,aio=
=3Dthreads,cache=3Dnone,format=3Draw,file=3Dnbd:localhost:9000,werror=3Ds=
top,rerror=3Dstop,tls-creds=3Dtls0: TLS negotiation required before optio=
n 7 (go)
server reported: Option 0x7 not permitted before TLS

The problem?  As specified, -drive is trying to pass tls-creds to the
raw format driver instead of the nbd protocol driver, but before we
get to the point where we can detect that raw doesn't know what to do
with tls-creds, the nbd driver has already failed because the server
complained.  The fix to the broken command line?  Pass
'...,file.tls-creds=3Dtls0' to ensure the tls-creds option is handed to
nbd, not raw.  But since the error message was rather cryptic, I'm
trying to improve the error message.

With this patch, the error message adds a line:

qemu-system-x86_64: -drive id=3Ddrive_image1,if=3Dnone,snapshot=3Doff,aio=
=3Dthreads,cache=3Dnone,format=3Draw,file=3Dnbd:localhost:9000,werror=3Ds=
top,rerror=3Dstop,tls-creds=3Dtls0: TLS negotiation required before optio=
n 7 (go)
Did you forget a valid tls-creds?
server reported: Option 0x7 not permitted before TLS

And with luck, someone grepping for that error message will find this
commit message and figure out their command line mistake.  Sadly, the
only mention of file.tls-creds in our docs relates to an --image-opts
use of PSK encryption with qemu-img as the client, rather than x509
certificate encryption with qemu-kvm as the client.
