The inexact behaviour of the host hardware may be different from the
guest architecture we are trying to emulate and the host hardware may
not be configurable to emulate the guest mode.

Have a look in softfloat.c and see all the places where
float_flag_inexact is set. Can you convince yourself that the host
hardware will do the same?

Because that is the behaviour of the PPC floating point unit. The
inexact flag will represent the last operation done.

Well you'll need to learn about floating point because these are rather
fundamental aspects of it's behaviour. In the old days QEMU used to use
the host floating point processor with it's template based translation.
However this led to lots of weird bugs because the floating point
answers under qemu where different from the target it was trying to
emulate. It was for this reason softfloat was introduced. The hardfloat
optimisation can only be done when we are confident that we will get the
exact same answer of the target we are trying to emulate - a "faster but
incorrect" mode is just going to cause confusion as discussed in the
previous thread. Have you read that yet?
