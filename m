Considering that this function implements reading PCI config space its API 
should aligh with what happens on hardware normally. You could make it 
unrelated but that does not make much sense other than causing trouble for 
callers.

The specific example (ati-vga) does expect and should support unaligned 
access. Not for all regs but for most registers, there's a table in docs 
which says for PCI POS registers (whatever those are) unalligned access is 
supported. This works now, if it should not work witout .impl.unaligned or 
some other value set somewhere that should be patched instead.
