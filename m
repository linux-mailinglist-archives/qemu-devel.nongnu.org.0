All of the CPUs are now in SMM, and INIT/SIPI/SIPI will be discarded
before 07a, so this is okay.

However I do see a problem, because a PCI device's DMA could overwrite
0x38000 between (06) and (10) and hijack the code that is executed in
SMM.  How is this avoided on real hardware?  By the time the new CPU
enters SMM, it doesn't run off cache-as-RAM anymore.
