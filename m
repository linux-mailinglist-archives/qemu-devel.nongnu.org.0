I=E2=80=99d take this patch anyway (because its motivation is just that oth=
er
programs might produce invalid images), and then not worry about the
case where we get an image produced by such another program (including
older versions of qemu) for which the user overrides the backing file at
runtime.

The preallocation is about ensuring that there are no
fall-through-to-backing holes in the image.  Discarding doesn=E2=80=99t cha=

Perhaps.

But seeing I wondered whether I didn=E2=80=99t already propose this at some
point, there is another reason for preallocation:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-02/msg00644.html
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-04/msg00329.html

All in all, I think data_file_raw should be interpretable as =E2=80=9CYou d=
on=E2=80=99t
have to look at any metadata to know which data to read or write=E2=80=9D.
(Maybe I=E2=80=99m wrong about that.)
Without any preallocation of metadata structure, it looks to me like we
break that promise.

(Yes, we could also force-zero the external data file during creation,
and blame users who put a backing file on images that don=E2=80=99t have on=
e =E2=80=93
both of which are not unreasonable!  But we could also just preallocate
the metadata.)
