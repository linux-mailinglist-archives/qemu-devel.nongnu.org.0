That's only true if we want to.

Command line is an interface usable by machines.  Not the ideal,
but it works.

Messages on stderr are not an interface for machines.  We must
provide something better, and I don't think "wait until we
convert everything to QMP" is a reasonable answer.

Right now, it's only in the amount of information.

Right now, it includes string values that are fixed at build
time, but collected dynamically at run time (because we are
describing QOM types, which are collected dynamically).

The structure of the additional information can be part of the
schema, yes.  The actual information needs to be collected at
runtime so we won't be able to make it part of the QAPI schema.

I agree that "neat and simple" is a nice goal.  But it's not a
requirement, right?
