Nit: Remove one of the two "here" in the above sentence.

I'm not sure what this sentence is really good for... of course new stuff
has to prove its usefulness first, but that's always the case and does not
need to be mentioned in the documentation, I think? ... maybe that sentence
is better something for the patch description instead of (hopefully)
long-lasting documentation here?
