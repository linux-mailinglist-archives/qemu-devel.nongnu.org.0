No.

Yes.

But if we don't change it, the stream is broken too. :)

Then the destination VM will receive e.g. two apic_id==0 instances (I
think the apic_id==256 instance will wrongly overwrite the apic_id==0
one), while the vcpu with apic_id==256 will use the initial apic
values.

So IMHO we should still fix this, even if it changes the migration
stream.  At least we start to make it right.

For each vcpu, I think yes it should be a constant as long as the
topology is the same.  This is how I understand it to be set:

(1) In pc_cpus_init(), we init these:

    possible_cpus = mc->possible_cpu_arch_ids(ms);
    for (i = 0; i < ms->smp.cpus; i++) {
        pc_new_cpu(pcms, possible_cpus->cpus[i].arch_id, &error_fatal);
    }

(2) In x86_cpu_apic_create(), we apply the apic_id to "id" property:

    qdev_prop_set_uint32(cpu->apic_state, "id", cpu->apic_id);

Sounds doable.
