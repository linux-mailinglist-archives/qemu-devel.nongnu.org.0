The initial case reported by Gavin in this thread is
"-serial tcp:127.0.0.1:50900" with the other end being a program which
listens on TCP port 50900 and then sleeps without accepting any incoming
connections, which blocks the serial port output and effectively blocks
the guest bootup. If you want to insulate the guest from badly
behaved consumers like that (or the related consumer who accepts
the connection and then just doesn't read data from it) you probably
need to deal with more than just POLLHUP. But I'm not sure how much
we should care about these cases as opposed to just telling users
not to do that...
