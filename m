Looking at PATCH 3 again, I got temporarily confused again.  Let me
spell things out even more, to improve my chances at staying not
confused...

To effect the split of (exec), you rewrite bottom half
monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher() as coroutine monitor_qmp_dispatcher_co(),
then have do_qmp_dispatch() either call the the handler directly, or
schedule it to run in a bottom half.  Cases:

(exec-co): handle_qmp_command() sends the command to coroutine
monitor_qmp_dispatcher_co(), which calls monitor_qmp_dispatch(), which
runs the handler, in coroutine context, in the main loop.

(exec): Likewise, except monitor_qmp_dispatch() schedules the handler to
run in a bottom half, outside coroutine context, in the main loop.

(exec-oob): handle_qmp_command() runs monitor_qmp_dispatch(), which runs
the handler, outside coroutine context, in the iothread.
