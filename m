BTW, quick clarification here.

IIUC, Claudio says the test is 'virsh save $VMNAME /some/file'. This
is *not* running 'savevm' at the QEMU level. So it is a bit misleading
refering to it as savevm in the thread here.

'virsh save' is simply wired up to the normal QEMU 'migrate' commands,
with libvirt giving QEMU a pre-opened FD, which libvirt processes the
other end of to write out to disk.

IOW, the performance delta is possibly on libvirt's side rather
than QEMU's.

Daniel
