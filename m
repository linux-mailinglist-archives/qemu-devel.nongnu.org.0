Yes, that matches my experience as well.  '^@a' length 2 is a different=20
socket than '^@a^@' length three, but 'a' length 1 and 'a^@' length 2=20
are the same socket because only non-abstract sockets end at the earlier=20
of the first NUL or the length.

Two combinations, but only one behavior.

And two more behaviors.

Yes, having an additional knob to express abstract sockets seems better=20
than overloading a specific character (although @sockname is a relative=20
name, and relative socket names already come with their own set of=20
problems).

Indeed.

You'd want to make 'tight' and 'abstract' optional, with defaults to the=20
existing practice, but otherwise this looks sane to me.

Agreed that this is less likely to be needed.

Also sounds reasonable to me.
