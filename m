The fuse3-devel RPM on Fedora has some, but not all, of the fuse headers
the patches copy in. Not sure if that's enough though.

The kernel-devel RPM has fuse.h which seems to match fuse_kernel.h header
being imported.

Obviously that would mean a configure check to see if the required
headers exist or not & are new enough for VSOCK
