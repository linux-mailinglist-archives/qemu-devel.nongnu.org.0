Yup, that's a good point.

There is also a corner case in one of the later patches where I check
this limit against the PA using the rounded-up device_memory_size.
This could result in returning an error if the last memory slot would
still fit in the PA space, but the rounded-up quantity wouldn't. I
don't think it matters much, but I'll fix it anyway.

Agreed.

I don't see how. These devices live at a minimum of 256GB, which
contradicts the very meaning of !highmem being a 4GB limit.

Because although this makes sense if you only care about a 32bit
limit, we eventually want to check against an arbitrary PA limit and
enable the individual devices that do fit in that space.

In order to do that, we need to compute the base addresses for these
extra devices. Also, computing 3 base addresses isn't going to be
massively expensive.

Thanks,
