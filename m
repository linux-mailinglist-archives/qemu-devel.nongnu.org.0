AFAIK, the jobs in this file just augment what is already defined
in the main .gitlab-ci.yml. Also since we're providing setup info
for other people to configure custom runners, these jobs are usable
for non-gating CI scenarios too.

IOW, the jobs in this file happen to be usable for gating, but they
are not the only gating jobs, and can be used for non-gating reasons.

This is a complicated way of saying that gating.yml is not a desirable
filename, so I'd suggest splitting it in two and having these files
named based on what their contents is, rather than their use case:

   .gitlab-ci.d/runners-s390x.yml
   .gitlab-ci.d/runners-aarch64.yml

The existing jobs in .gitlab-ci.yml could possibly be moved into
a .gitlab-ci.d/runners-shared.yml file for consistency.

I think I'd make it more flexible in particular to allow multiple
branches. For example I have multiple subsystems and have separate
branches for each.

This could be as simple as allowing a regex prefix

  - if: '$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME =~ /^staging/'

I'd be inclined to actually use docker on the custom runners.

eg. instead of having separate physical machines or VMs for each
(distro, arch) pair, have a single host distro for the arch. Then
use docker to provide the build environment against each distro.

IOW, a RHEL-8 aarch64 host, running docker for ubuntu18.04, fedora30
etc.

That way we don't end up duplicating all these packages, and instead
can use  tests/docker/Dockerfiles/ubuntu1804.docker.  This ensures
that if a user needs to reproduce a build failure on their own local
aarch64 machine, they can run docker and get the exact same build
architecture.

It also has the benefit that we don't need to worry about how to
setup gitlab runners for every distro we care about. We only need to
do gitlab runner for the standard host distro, which spawns a pristine
throwaway docker env.

I appreciate this is a big change from what you've done in this patch
though, so don't consider this comment a blocker for initial merge.
I think we should do this as the long term strategy though. Essentially
for Linux builds, everything should always be container based.

Regards,
Daniel
