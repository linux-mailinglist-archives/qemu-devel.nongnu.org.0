I don't think libvirt will automatically make use of multifunction
endpoints, except maybe for some built-in devices, so yes it probably
would be up to the user to explicitly create a multifunction device.
But are there other scenarios that generate an automatic hot-unplug?
If a user creates a multifunction slot and then triggers a hot-unplug
themselves, it's easy to place the blame on the user if the result is
unexpected, but is it so obviously a user configuration error if the
hotplug occurs as an automatic response to a migration?  I'm not as
sure about that.

As indicated, I don't know whether this should just be documented or if
we should spend time preventing it, but someone, somewhere will
probably think it's a good idea to put their primary and failover NIC
in the same slot and be confused that the underlying mechanisms cannot
support it.  It doesn't appear that it would be too difficult to test
QEMU_PCI_CAP_MULTIFUNCTION (not set) and PCI_FUNC (is 0) for the
primary, but maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Thanks,

Alex
