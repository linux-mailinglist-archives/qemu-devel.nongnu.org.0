The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Failed to get shared "write" lock with 'qemu-img info'

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When running 'qemu-img info test.qcow2' while test.qcow2 is currently
  used by a Qemu process, I get the error

  qemu-img: Could not open 'test.qcow2': Failed to get shared "write"
  lock.

  =

  Why does displaying information about a disk image need a write lock for =
the file?

  Steps to reproduce:

  qemu-img create -f qcow2 test.qcow2 10M
  qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -drive file=3Dtest.qcow2
  qemu-img info test.qcow2

  The above was tested with Qemu version 2.10.0
