It does not solve all of them _easily_. I do believe that any solution
to these problems can be engineered in C++, if only because C++
is essentially a superset of C. The question is whether the result can
be made easier / safer to use and generally more elegant. I believe
that the answer is yes, see proof at end of mail.

However, before going further, glib offers way more than gobject.
So there=E2=80=99s that too=E2=80=A6 And I=E2=80=99m not saying migrating t=
o C++ is a good
idea, I=E2=80=99m just trying to evaluate the various options fairly.

Thank you for this remarkably non-stupid answer ;-) You have really

This was the part I was pointing to in my initial comment.

C++ solves that basic =E2=80=9COO=E2=80=9D stuff well, and goes a little be=
yond QOM
or GObject in offering IMO many other benefits, e.g. wrt type safety.

This kind of things has existed for a very long time. CORBA dates back
to 1991. Also, I=E2=80=99m not sure how important multiple programming lang=
uages
are for the qemu use-case. I believe that what matters more is remotely
accessible objects (e.g. over a socket), which in turn makes it almost
trivial to call from another language as long as you accept some kind
of serialization / deserialization process along the way.

GObject only seems marginally better for the =E2=80=9Cin same process=E2=80=
=9D use case,
in the sense that it makes =E2=80=9Cobjects=E2=80=9D that can be used from =
any language,
indeed, but at the cost of being somewhat foreign and weird in all language=
s,
including C.

Look at the GClosure marshalling, for example, and compare it with the
example I give you at end of this email, and you tell me which one looks
easier and safer to use.

Exposing the properties and making them introspectable are the
fundamental feature we need to discuss. So agreement here.

What you have not explained to my satisfaction
yet is how GObject is a better starting point for re-creating a new
externally-accessible API than some kind of wrapper built in C++
and taking advantage of modern C++ features.

How much of that is actually useful to create a new usable qemu API?

>=20

That, to me, looks fundamental, since not having it would require
a total re-architecture of the rest of qemu.

But it looks also somewhat trivial to implement in C++.
For example, obj[=E2=80=9Cid=E2=80=9D] could return a PropertyAccessor<T>
that lets you read or write the object knowing that it is of type
T, so you could write:

=09if (my_object[=E2=80=9Cid=E2=80=9D] < 3) // Automatically checks the typ=
e

or=20

=09my_object[=E2=80=9Cid=E2=80=9D] =3D 42;

The latter would call PropertyAccessor<int>::operator=3D(int), which
in turn would check if property =E2=80=9Cid=E2=80=9D exists in my_object, i=
f it has type
=E2=80=9Cint=E2=80=9D, and so on.

Implementation-wise, a simple std::map of BaseProperty pointers,
where each would be an instance of some

=09template<class T>
=09class Property : public BaseProperty
=09{
=09=09operator T(); // get
=09=09T& operator=3D(const T&); // set
=09};

=09template<class T, class Index>
=09class PropertyAccessor
=09{
=09=09PropertyAccessor(PropertyOwner<T> &owner, Index &index) : owner(owner=
), index(index) {}
=09=09operator T() { return owner[index]; }
=09=09T& operator =3D(const T&val) { return owner[index] =3D val; }
=09};

> - QOM's focus on properties: no introspection of methods

OK. So I=E2=80=99m giving a bad example below, because I=E2=80=99m introspe=
cting
a method, but=E2=80=A6 ;-)

> - QOM's support for multiple channels: visitors

How different are visitors from iterators in C++? Sorry, showing my
ignorance here=E2=80=A6=20


I do not fully understand all the subtleties of QOM, nor all its use cases.
However, my own experience with =E2=80=9Cmodern=E2=80=9D C++ shows that it=
=E2=80=99s pretty
straightforward to get it to do extremely interesting introspective work.

As an illustration, which happens to be directly related to the problem
of interconnecting with another language, I would like to share the followi=
ng
tidbit of code (https://github.com/c3d/xl/blob/master/src/runtime.cpp#L73).

Tree *  xl_evaluate(Scope *scope, Tree *tree)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----
//   Dispatch evaluation to the main entry point
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------=
----
{
    return MAIN->Evaluate(scope, tree);
}
XL_NATIVE(evaluate);

With this little XL_NATIVE macro, the compiler automatically makes the
function xl_evaluate available to the XL language as =E2=80=9Cevaluate=E2=
=80=9D, with
the correct parameter sets. In particular:

- It inserts an object representing xl_evaluate in a list of all native fun=
ctions
- It generates a function that generates the source-code interface,
  which in XL would look like `evaluate A:scope, B:tree as tree`,
  see record #28601 in the output below. Note that this includes=20
  all the required type conversions (e.g. from `Tree *` to `tree`).
- It generates a function that generates a machine-level prototype
  using LLVM, i.e. it automatically all the LLVM calls required to declare
    Tree *xl_evaluate(Scope *scope, Tree *tree);
- It generates a function that acts as a wrapper around it and calls
  the prototype above, doing the necessary type conversions.

Here is an example of output at run-time:

[=E2=80=A6]

What I believe makes my point is that this is achieved with 476 lines of C+=
+
(admittedly not the simplest C++ on earth, but still not super-complex eith=
er)
If you are curious, this is done by https://github.com/c3d/xl/blob/master/i=
nclude/native.h.

So in 500 lines of C++ code, we have something that automatically turns any=
 C function into
a wrapper object that:
- Gives you introspected type information about the parameters and return t=
ype of the function
- Gives you directly-accessible methods that operate on that function in a =
type-safe way

The same approach could of course offer serialization, construction of obje=
cts, etc.

So to me, this proves that introspecting an API in C++ is not just =E2=80=
=9Ceasy=E2=80=9D, it is highly usable.


Cheers,
Christophe

PS: Again, I=E2=80=99m not necessarily advocating we start writing any C++ =
code.
I=E2=80=99m just trying to understand the value proposition of GObject, QOM=
, etc,
in order to make a more informed decision before doing anything.
