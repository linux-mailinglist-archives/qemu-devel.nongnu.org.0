I have a cheesy-but-functional set of test code
https://git.linaro.org/people/peter.maydell/semihosting-tests.git/
here, fwiw.

Is there a specification for RISC-V semihosting? This is
likely to be my first question when the support comes
round for review, so you can have it early :-)  We'd
prefer to implement specified interfaces, not random
ad-hoc "this seems to be what newlib wants to see,
which is turn got hacked together by copying some other
architecture's code".

Yeah, the docs could perhaps spell it out more clearly, but
the intention is that the call blocks.

It's possible if necessary to implement this so it doesn't
block the entire simulation: you just have the QEMU implementation
do a block-until-character-or-timeout operation, and if it times
out then you rewind the guest PC to point at the BRK/HLT insn that
triggered the semihosting call, and resume simulation. That would
give an opportunity for things like interrupts to fire before going
back into waiting for a character. This feels to me like it's a bit
overcomplicated unless it turns out we actually require it though.

Isn't the answer to this "don't use a command line that tries
to connect stdio to multiple things" ?
