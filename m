For 6.0.1 you're still going to be lacking the gitlab CI custom runner
config that Peter has just started using for testing for non-x86 arch
coverage.

It will at least have the x86 coverage using shared runners though
which is better than nothing.

The custom runner config invokes jobs when pushing to 'qemu-project'
gitlab namespace (ie not user forks), if using a branch with a name
prefix 'staging'. So from 6.1.1 onwards if you push to (for example)
'staging-stable' branch that'll trigger the same set of GitLab CI
jobs that Peter runs for the master branch.


Regards,
Daniel
