You have been the delightful beneficiary of all doubts thus far, I 
promise. I am not aware of more discrepancies at the moment, but I 
didn't finish my prototype, either.

I ... yes. Technically correct. I had meant separating them out even 
further in the docs, which I suppose implies two top-level construct 
names with how you have the grammar laid out.

I see you want to get rid of one of these productions, though, so don't 
worry about this thought of mine. We can simplify in the other direction.

What do you mean by "simple union sugar"? Wait, before you answer, let 
me make sure I have the nuances of the forms straight in my head.

The following is my attempt to summarize what I know about these forms.
(Please correct me where I am mistaken.)

ALTERNATE is like an untagged union with no discriminator/tag on the 
wire. I think of a pure C union when I think of this form. The forms you 
can use are limited, based on our ability to differentiate them upon 
parsing.

SIMPLE UNION takes no `discriminator` or `base` parameter in the QAPI 
specification. However, the wire format is not an undifferentiated union.

{ 'union': 'foobar',
   'data': { 'a': 'TypeA',
             'b': 'TypeB' } }

Enjoys life at runtime as:

{ "type": ['a' | 'b'],
   "data": ... }

(with TypeA or TypeB's definition filling in for the ellipsis as denoted 
by the type field.)


FLAT UNION has a more complex definitional form. It specifies a base 
type reference by name *or* defined in-line. It also specifies a 
discriminator, which must be an enumerated type in the base.

For data, it no longer allows you to specify List[T] as a member type.

For inline definitions of base, it uses a version of type info that also 
allows the FEATURES field.

(Deep breath).

So, when you say remove "simple union sugar", do you mean the entirety 
of the tagged union form? What do we replace it by?

(Hardcoded, but compatible flat unions that use "type" field as 
discriminator to ensure backwards compatibility?)

Can you share what you have in mind for how to fuse 'struct' and 
discriminated unions? At the high QAPI grammatical level; no need to 
delve into code generator details.

(Unless you want to, and then I'll read them.)
