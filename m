I see the point of this patch now.  I'm still unclear on how s390
works for DMA protection, but it seems totally different from the
IOMMU model on x86/arm.  Considering this, please ignore above patch
[1] because that's hackish in all cases to play with iotlb caches, and
current patch should be much better (and easier) IMHO.

Thanks,
