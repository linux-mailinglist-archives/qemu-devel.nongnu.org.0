AIUI the modern/legacy terminology is part of the VirtIO spec, so
while I agree that it's not necessarily the least prone to ambiguity
at least it's well defined.

That's also true. I never claimed the way virtio-pci does it is
perfect!

I think that if reinventing the wheel is generally agreed not to be
a good idea, then it stands to reason that reinventing it twice can
only be described as absolute madness :)

We should have a single way to control the VirtIO protocol version
that works for all VirtIO devices, regardless of transport. We might
even want to have virtio-*-{device,ccw}-non-transitional to mirror
the existing virtio-*-pci-non-transitional.

FWIW, libvirt already implements support for (non)-transitional
virtio-pci devices using either the dedicated devices or the base
virtio-pci plus the disable-{modern,legacy} attributes.
