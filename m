I think we need 3 series here.


1. All the re-factoring/preparation work I done in luks crypto driver, wh=
ich can be merged
now, pending minor changes from the review.
I think that it at least doesn't make the code worse.

2. Common code for the block layer to support key management this way or =
another,
   can be even added with not a single driver implementing it.

1,2 don't depend on each other mostly.


3. Key management in LUKS, which needs both 1,2, but thankfully is mostly=
 implemented,
and won't need to change much from the current implementation.


So I'll send 1 now, and I will star working on 2.

Last week we (I and Daniel) defined a draft of amend interface,
and if time permits we will work on that tomorrow to finalize the
interface.
