I use a similar trick for parsing "Fuzzy JSON" inside of qmp-shell.

It's cute, and I'm not really proud of it.

I have a prototype where I started this, but I use "---" as a document 
separator to allow us multiple definitions per file so that the nesting 
remains pleasant.

(YAML does not allow you to duplicate field names.)

I have a YAML prototype branch where I use `?field` to indicate optional 
syntax. It works just fine, at the expense of being slightly new to people.

I tested with normal YAML, but I was thinking about adopting strict YAML 
because Markus wanted some assurance we wouldn't get lost in the weeds 
using complex feature of YAML.

(Or, shoot ourselves entirely by accident.)

My prototype doesn't use anything that Strict YAML prohibits, so I 
thought it was a good idea.

IF -- IF IF IF IF IF we decide that actually we need the crazy 
horsepower of standard YAML, or that strict YAML is too buggy -- we 
could always just replace it. No real big deal.

Fair enough ... but there's no special meaning to quoting or not quoting 
the RHS in YAML, so maybe it's best to avoid pretending like there's a 
structural semantic between an identifier and a string there.

(Since they're both just strings, and the semantic difference is picked 
up inside the QAPI generator post-parse.)

Nevermind the earlier comment, then.

I guess I'll dust off the work I have already to show the class.
