I certainly can document the way we'll use it but that in turn depends
on how the job behaves.

With the current state of the job I plan to use it in two scenarios:

Preface: I'm currently changing libvirt to use one active bitmap per
checkpoint (checkpoint is name for the point in time we want to take
backup from). This means that a layer of the backing chain can have
multiple active bitmaps depending on how many checkpoints were created
in the current top layer. (previously we've tried to optimize things by
having just one bitmap active, but the semantics were getting too crazy
to be maintainable long-term)

Bitmaps are no longer propagated over to upper layers when creating
snapshots as we can use block-dirty-bitmap-populate instead.

1) backup

Prior to doing the backup I'm figuring out the final backup bitmap, this
involves creating a temporary bitmap populated by the job for every
layer of the backing chain above of the one which contains the bitmap we
want to take a backup from and then merge all of them together as a base
for the backup.

2) blockjobs

Note: This is currently an outline how the things should be as I've hit
the snag with attempting to run the population jobs during 'ready' state
of a active-layer block-commit/blockdev-mirror job only an hour ago and
I need to change a few things.

2.1) active layer block-commit/blockdev-mirror

When the job reaches 'ready' state I'll create bitmaps in the
destination/base image of the job for every bitmap in the images
dropped/merged (we use blockdev-mirror in full-sync mode) by the
blockjob. This will capture the writes that happen after 'job-complete'.

The job will then be completed and the 2.2. will be executed as well.

2.2) non-active commit and also continuation of active layer block-commit/blockdev-mirror

After the job is completed succesfully I'll create temporary
non-persistent bitmaps for/in the images removed by the blockjob and
merge them into the destination image's bitmaps depending on their
original location in the backing chain so that the bitmap state still
properly describes which blocks have changed.

After that the original images willbe blockdev-del-eted. The above is
partialy in use today and since the job is already completed also
requires blockdev-reopen to successfuly write to the bitmaps.

----

While writing the above down I've actually realized that controling the
destination of the bitmap might not be as useful as I've thought
originally as in 2.2. step I might need the allocation bitmap merged
into multiple bitmaps, so I'd either need a temporary bitmap anyways or
would have to re-run the job multiple times which seems wasteful. I'm no
longer fully persuaded that adding the 'merge' step to the dirty
populate blockjob will be the best thing since sliced bread.
