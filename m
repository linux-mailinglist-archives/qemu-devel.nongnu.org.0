Hi Shaked,

In the prob function, before you are trying to do any DMA operations =
with your device, you should call pci_enable_device and then =
pci_set_master. Also you might need to map the resources of your device.
Check PCI driver documentation: =
https://lxr.missinglinkelectronics.com/linux/Documentation/PCI/pci.rst#L19=
9

Best regards,
Yan.

I've missed something but when the interrupt is called the transfer to =
the RAM address should be completed, however it seems like the =
dma_write_buffer function from the device does not perform any transfer. =
What Am I missing?
