qemu_guest_getrandom will preferentially use the crypto library random
APIs (gnutls, or gcrypt). If both are compiled out that it will use
getrandom() if supported by the C library and current kernel. If that
fails then it will try /dev/urandom if it exists, finally /dev/random.=20
On Windows it uses their native crypto API. See this dependant series:
