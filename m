hi Alex,
got it. so do you suggest that vendors use consistent driver name over
generations of devices?
for qat, they create different modules for each generation. This
practice is not good if they want to support migration between devices
of different generations, right?

and can I understand that we don't want support of migration between
different mdev types even in future ?

Thanks
Yan
