Actually, 4k rather than 8k stack overflow guard pages are typical on=20
some OS.  The problem with stack-allocating anything larger than the=20
guard page size is that you can end up overshooting the guard page, and=20
then the OS is unable to catch stack overflow in the normal manner of=20
sending SIGSEGV.  Also, when using coroutines, it is very common to have=20
limited stack size in the first place, where large stack allocations can=20
run into issues.  So in general, it's a good rule of thumb to never=20
stack-allocate something if it can be larger than 4k.

Not by default, but you can compile with -Wframe-larger-than=3D4096 (or=20
even smaller) to catch instances where stack allocation is likely to run=20
into trouble.

Yes, and I've already fixed the missing initializer.

Yes, and our documentation for g_auto* reminds that all such variables=20
with automatic cleanup must have an initializer or be set prior to any=20
exit path.  I think I see why I didn't catch it beforehand - I'm=20
compiling with --enable-debug, which passes CFLAGS=3D-g, while the=20
compiler warning occurs when -O2 is in effect; but it is rather annoying=20
that gcc doesn't catch the bug when not optimizing.

Thanks, and assuming that's with my initializer fix squashed in.
