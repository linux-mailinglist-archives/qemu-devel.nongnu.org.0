virtiofsd has two DBus interfaces:

1. org.qemu.Virtiofsd - the management interface

   We don't expect QEMU to communicate with this.  Administrators or
   management tools will connect to this.

2. dbus-vmstate - we'll probably need this for live migration

   This is for QEMU<->vhost-user device backend communication.
