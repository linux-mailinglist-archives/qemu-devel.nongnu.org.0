The state of this bug is "Fix committed", but the last comments look
like there is still work to do ... should this get reset to "New" or can
we close this bug now?

Title:
  qemu-system-arm segfaults while servicing SYS_HEAPINFO

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I compiled QEMU version 5.2.0 from source on Ubuntu 18.04, and tried
  to use it to run the attached bare-metal Arm hello-world image, using
  the command line

  qemu-system-arm -M microbit -semihosting -nographic -device
  loader,file=3Dhello.hex

  The result was that qemu-system-arm itself died of a segfault.
  Compiling it for debugging, the location of the segfault was in
  target/arm/arm-semi.c, in the case handler for the semihosting call
  TARGET_SYS_HEAPINFO, on line 1020 which assigns to 'rambase':

              const struct arm_boot_info *info =3D env->boot_info;
              target_ulong rambase =3D info->loader_start;

  and the problem seems to be that 'info', aka env->boot_info, is NULL
  in this context.
