> systemd-nspawn containers don't have CAP_SYS_ADMIN

Above statement is utter bollocks. Please ignore..


I finally got to the bottom of all this and now have the test suite passing.

- don't use `--disable-keyring', it's busted

- systemd-nspawn containers need to be configured with additional
capabilities/syscalls (see below)

I noticed another test failing (postcopy-ram in tests/qtest/migration-
test.c). It needs access to munlockall which is covered by CAP_IPC_LOCK
capability.

Here is my .nspawn config needed to get the test suite passing inside a
systemd-nspawn container:

[Exec]
Capability=3DCAP_IPC_LOCK
SystemCallFilter=3Dadd_key keyctl

Title:
  Test failure in test-crypto-secret.c

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  When running qemu test suite I'm seeing a test failure:

  ERROR:../qemu/tests/test-crypto-secret.c:144:test_secret_keyring_good:
  assertion failed: (key >=3D 0)

  Host is Arch Linux running in the standard Arch build environment
  (essentially an nspawn container).

  I first noticed this at release of 5.1.0 but it's still there on
  current trunk. For 5.1.0 I was able to sidestep the issue by building
  with `--disable-keyring' but this no longer works (I think due to
  9866a33cbb7046891dec3dcc9ca2015828673afe)

  Any clues on what might be the cause? Not sure how to debug.
