Well it's a monitor command so I think so; although it's not really
designed for an error - it's a user action.  Doing a
migrate_set_error(..) followed by a qemu_file_shutdown is probably a
good bet.

The problem is during postcopy you're toast when that happens because
you can't restart; however, can this happen once we're actually in
postcopy?  It's a little different - if it happens before the transition
to postcopy then it's the same as precopy; if it happens afterwards..
well it's going to happen ont he destination side and that's quite
different.
