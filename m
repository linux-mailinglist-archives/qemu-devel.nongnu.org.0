Ha, "trivial" reminds me of a story.  The math professor, after having
spent a good chunk of his lecture developing a proof on the blackboad
turns to the audience to explain why this little part doesn't require
proof with the words familiar to any math student "and this is trivial."
Pause, puzzled look...  "Is it trivial?"  Pause, storms out of the
lecture hall.  A minute or three pass.  Professor comes back beaming,
"it is trivial!", and proceeds with the proof.

My point is: it might be trivial with Coccinelle once you know how to do
it.  We don't.

Suggest "(can't figure out how to match several definitions regardless
of control flow)".

Yes.

The chaining "identifier rule1.FOO" is by name.  It's reliable only as
long as there is exactly one instance of the name.

We already discussed the case of the function name: if there are two
instances of foo(), and rule1 matches only one of them, then we
nevertheless apply the rules chained to rule1 to both.  Because that can
be wrong, you came up with the ___ trick, which chains reliably.

The same issue exists with the variable name: if there are two instances
of @local_err, and rule1 matches only one of them, then we nevertheless
apply the rules chained to rule1 to both.  Can also be wrong.

What are the conditions for "wrong"?

Because the ___ chaining is reliable, we know rule1 matched the
function, i.e. it has a parameter Error **errp, and it has a automatic
variable Error *local_err =3D NULL.

We're good as long as *all* identifiers @local_err in this function are
declared that way.  This seems quite likely.  It's not certain, though.

Since nested declarations of Error ** variables are rare, we can rely on
review to ensure we transform these functions correctly.

I still can't see what chaining by function name in addition to the ___
chaining buys us.

Right, although this particular problem is not really Coccinelle's
fault.  Blindly treating all instances of a certain identifier in a
certain area the same regardless of how they are bound to declarations
is fundamentally unreliable, regardless of your actual tooling.
