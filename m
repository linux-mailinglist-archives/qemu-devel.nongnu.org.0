Ah, I missed to notice that.  Interesting.

Indeed, here we go, confirming the overlay of a QCOW2 backing file _not_
having the 'backing_fmt' written into the image:

    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./another_base.qcow2 ./over=
lay1_of_ab.qcow2
    qemu-img: warning: Deprecated use of backing file without explicit back=
ing format (detected format of qcow2)
    Formatting './overlay1_of_ab.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D4294967296 back=
ing_file=3D./another_base.qcow2 cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff r=
efcount_bits=3D16

That's neat.

(I wonder if this bit should also be documented.)

Understood.  Easy to miss when not paying attention; thanks for pointing
it out.

Fair enough; it's an understandable compromise.

And your series is a strict improvement as-is; it should not be held up.

Oops, yes it is; bad me.  Sorry for the mix-up.  I meant to amend the
format to 'raw'.

Yeah, fair enough.

Hmm, I tried the following way, but it doesn't provoke the warning:

    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img convert -B ./base.raw -O qcow2 overlay1.qcow2 =
flattened.qcow2

    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img info flattened.qcow2=20
    image: flattened.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 4 GiB (4294967296 bytes)
    disk size: 196 KiB
    cluster_size: 65536
    backing file: ./base.raw
    Format specific information:
        compat: 1.1
        lazy refcounts: false
        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false

What am I missing?


            - - -

<digression>

Ah, didn't realize the inconsistency of 'convert' lacking the '-F'
shorthand ... which reminds me, there are at least _three_ ways that I
know of, to specify backing file format with 'create':

    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o 'backing_file=3D./base.raw,backing_fmt=3D=
raw' ./overlay1.qcow2
    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.raw -o backing_fmt=3Draw overlay1.=
qcow2
    $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.raw -F raw ./overlay1.qcow2

I'm wondering about the consistency of having all the above three
supported for other operations too.  Now I at least know 'convert' lacks
the "-F".

Not sure how much people care about this :-)
