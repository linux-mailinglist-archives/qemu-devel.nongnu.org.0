OK, i understand.
I may add it like this:
+##
+{ 'struct': 'DirtyRateInfo',
+  'data': {'dirty-rate': 'int64',
+           'status': 'DirtyRateStatus',
+           'start-timestamp': 'int64',
+           'calc-time': 'int64'} }
+
+##
the stat-timestamp would be initial_time which gets from qemu_clock_get_ms(QEMU_CLOCK_REALTIME)
at the beginning of calculation while calc_time is time-duration in microsecond.

But i reconsider that, it maybe still need to reset the CalculatingState as DIRTY_RATE_STATUS_UNSTARTED
here?

Initialization like:
void qmp_calc_dirty_rate(int64_t calc_time, Error **errp)
{
   XXXX

    if (CalculatingState == DIRTY_RATE_STATUS_MEASURING) {
        return;
    }


    (void)dirtyrate_set_state(&CalculatingState, CalculatingState,
                              DIRTY_RATE_STATUS_UNSTARTED);
    XXXX
}

It could not prevent concurrent scene which may lead to disorder state:(
