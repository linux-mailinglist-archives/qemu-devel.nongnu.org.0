A bool would not be sufficient, because the caller would need to know
which direction to wait for I/O on.

Looking at the code it does a flush of outstanding data, then sends
some bytes, and then receives some bytes. The write will probably
work most of the time, but the receive is almost always going to
return -EAGAIN. So I don't think that failing with EGAIN is going
to be much of a benefit.

Are you sure ?  AFAIK there is no existing usage of gnutls_bye() at all
in QEMU.

I'm not convinced the clean shutdown at the TLS level does anything importa=
nt
given that we already have done a clean shutdown at the NBD level.
