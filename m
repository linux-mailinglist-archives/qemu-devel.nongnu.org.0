Hi,

Apparently QEMU static linking is slowly bitroting. Obviously it
depends the libraries an user has installed, anyway it seems there
are not much testing done.

This series fixes few issues, enough to build QEMU on a Ubuntu
18.04 host.

Peter commented on v1:

  The main reason for supporting static linking is so we can build
  the user-mode emulators. Almost always the problems with
  static linking the softmmu binaries and the tools are
  issues with the distro's packaging of the static libraries
  (pkg-config files which specify things that don't work for
  static is a common one).

  So we could put in a lot of checking of "is what pkg-config
  tells us broken". Or we could just say "we don't support static
  linking for anything except the usermode binaries". We
  should probably phase in deprecation of that because it's
  possible somebody's using it seriously, but it seems like
  a fairly weird thing to do to me.

I share his view on this (restricting static linking to qemu-user)
but since the work was already done when I read his comment, I still
send the v2.

Since v1:
- pkg-config already use the '--static' argument, do not add it twice
- Fixed x86_64 host builds (was missing GTK and OpenGL patches)
- Added Niels R-b tag on the first patch
- The Travis-CI job now succeeds:
  https://travis-ci.org/philmd/qemu/jobs/545653697 (6 min 7 sec)

Regards,

Phil.
