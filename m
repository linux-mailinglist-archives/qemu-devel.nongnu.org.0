Quick reply without having thought through the issues at all: I'm not
opposed to you doing work to enable additional or even arbitrary memory
sizes where these actually work.  I'm first and foremost opposed to me
wasting time on "improving" code that is not used for anything.  That's
why I dumbed down spd_data_generate().

Secondly, I'm opposed to QEMU "correcting" user configuration.  I want
QEMU do exactly what it's told, and fail with a clear error message when
that is not possible.  The error message may include hints for the user
on how to correct the configuration.
