Yes, and this depends on how far exactly we want to go on our first 
conversion pass. The exact point we pick as our first intermediate step 
might determine these common conversions.

QemuOpts might be a reasonable first step, or maybe we want to go all 
the way straight to QAPI.

In a few cases (like -cpu), we probably want to start normalizing the 
way in which models are lookup up and defined; some architectures allow 
you to lowercase the models, or perform other text mapping conversions.

We could start deprecating / standardizing these transformations to try 
and unify the CPU parsing infrastructure which would give us a chance to 
describe it all with one set of rules.

Some of this depends on Markus's existing patches -- He has a series 
from 2018 (IIRC) that attempts a lot of the low-hanging fruit for this 
work, and that might serve as a reasonable basis.

Things to discuss.

It's a good point to talk about.

- Markus considers the platonic ideal of a CLI one in which each flag is 
a configuration directive, and each directive that references another 
directive must appear after the directive in which it references.

- I tend to consider the ideal configuration to be a static object that 
has no inherent order from one key to the next, e.g. a JSON object or 
static flat file that can be used to configure the sysemu.

They're not compatible visions; and they have implications for error 
ordering and messages and so on.

For the meantime, Markus's vision is closer to what QEMU already does, 
so it's likely the winning answer for now and if a conversion to the 
other idea is required at a time later, we'll have to tackle it then. (I 
think.)

It's a good subject of discussion. (Also relevant: if parsing is to 
occur in more than the CLI context, the existing contextual CLI parser 
error system needs to be reworked to avoid monitor-unsafe error calls. 
It's not trivial, I think.)

That might be interesting. I did some fairly thorough auditing to 
understand what each flag actually accepts at-present, but I don't have 
good experience with any fuzzer such to be able to model that exactly.

I'd be happy to hear about ways we could try to model this. Possibly 
intentionally deprecating things to reduce the size of some of our 
weirder parsers might help the modeling effort, too.
