Public bug reported:

I want to use qemu-arm-static to cross-compile software. The compiler
itself is a native cross-compiler connected via "distcc".

The problem is that a script tries to do some stuff with "git" and with
a "git clone -s" command the whole story reproducibly stops with a
"segmentation fault".

I don't know how to properly debug the issue but it happens 100% of the
time that I get the "crash" or git just hangs forever with 100% CPU
usage.
