I am able to reproduce using docker and qemu-arm version 1.5.93

Title:
  In qemu chroot, repeating "qemu: Unsupported syscall: 384" messages.
  sys_getrandom ?

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  On exec of an armv7 qemu chroot on my local x86_64 desktop, launched
  via

          /usr/sbin/qemu-binfmt-conf.sh

  from

          qemu-linux-user-2.9.0-374.1.x86_64

  on the host, inside the chroot any compile activity is laced with
  repetitions of

          qemu: Unsupported syscall: 384

  messages.

  This wasn't always the case -- but, TBH, it's been ~ 6 months since I
  used this env, and there have been scads of usual pkg updates in the
  interim.  These messages appear to be non-fatal, with no particular
  effect at all; at least not so far ...

  From a chat in #IRC,

  	[10:05] davidgiluk clever/pgnd: I see it as getrandom
  	[10:05] davidgiluk pgnd: https://fedora.juszkiewicz.com.pl/syscalls.html=
   sort it on the ARM table and you can easily see it
  	[10:05] clever arch/arm/tools/syscall.tbl:384  common  getrandom        =
       sys_getrandom
  	[10:06] davidgiluk pgnd: my *guess* is that something is calling getrand=
om, getting told it's not implemented and then falling back to using /dev/u=
random
  	[10:10] pgnd davidgiluk: If that *is* the case, is it to be considered a=
 problem, or just informational?
  	[10:12] davidgiluk pgnd: As long as it's falling back probably informati=
onal; but someone should probably go and wire up sys_getrandom at some point
