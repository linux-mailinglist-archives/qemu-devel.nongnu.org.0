So, moving the new scheme to the top is good, along with that we
should describe it directly, rather than in terms of how it differed
=66rom the old scheme.  The idea is that this should be a description of
what you need to know to use this right now primarily, and a history
only secondarily.

I'd suggest moving a discussion of the differences that were made here
