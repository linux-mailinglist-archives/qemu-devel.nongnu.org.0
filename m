Since Linux kernel v5.2-rc1 KVM has support for enabling SVE in guests.
This series provides the QEMU bits for that enablement. First, we
select existing CPU properties representing features we want to
advertise in addition to the SVE vector lengths and prepare
them for a qmp query. Then we introduce the qmp query, applying
it immediately to those selected features. We also document ARM CPU
features at this time. We next add a qtest for the selected CPU
features that uses the qmp query for its tests - and we continue to
add tests as we add CPU features with the following patches. So then,
once we have the support we need for CPU feature querying and testing,
we add our first SVE CPU feature property, 'sve', which just allows
SVE to be completely enabled/disabled. Following that feature property,
we add all 16 vector length properties along with the input validation
they need and tests to prove the validation works. At this point the
SVE features are still only for TCG, so we provide some patches to
prepare for KVM and then a patch that allows the 'max' CPU type to
enable SVE with KVM, but at first without vector length properties.
After a bit more preparation we add the SVE vector length properties
to the KVM-enabled 'max' CPU type along with the additional input
validation and tests that that needs.  Finally we allow the 'host'
CPU type to also enjoy these properties by simply sharing them with it.

v8:
  - Fixed another issue with the new make check tests. We weren't
    detecting kvm in a way that worked when running a cross-compiled
    aarch32 qemu on an aarch64 machine that had kvm. So now we detect
    kvm in a new, more robust way using the query-kvm qmp command.
    Besides some context changes after rebase, all the changes for
    this version are in 2/9, so I left all tags as they were.

v7:
  - Fixed kvm32 tests and added a couple
  - Picked up r-b's from Beata and t-b's from Masa

v6:
  - Adding missing visit_free() to an error path in
    qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion() in patch 1/9.
  - Rebased on latest master (applied cleanly)
  - Picked up r-b's from Richard and Eric

v5:
  - Now generate an error if vector lengths have been explicitly
    enabled, but SVE is disabled
  - Fixed a bug in sve_zcr_len_for_el()
  - Fixed a bug in kvm_arch_put/get_sve() and brought back the
    put/get of FPSR/FPCR
  - A few document clarifications and added some new sentences
  - Added a couple more tests
  - Added BIT_ULL and use it in the test
  - Removed an unnecessary bitmap search
  - Moved a cpu_max_get_sve_max_vq() hunk from 4/9 to 3/9 and
    added a fix for it in 8/9
  - Picked up some more tags from Eric

v4:
  - Integrated Richard Henderson's rework for the sve property
    validation, in order to do all validating at finalize time
    and save several lines of code.
  - Fixed 'host' cpu SVE default. It was still off by default.
  - Cleaned up #ifdef's for sve_bswap64()
  - Removed redundant KVM_CAP_ARM_SVE extension check in
    kvm_arm_sve_get_vls()
  - Improved the KVM SVE qtest
  - Renamed sve<vl-bits> to sve<N> everywhere
  - Renamed power-of-2 to power-of-two everywhere
  - Picked up some more tags from Richard

Thanks!
