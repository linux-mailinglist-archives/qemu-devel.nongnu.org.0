My wording is actually already broader than what is in the contributor 
covenant:

   This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also
   applies when an individual is representing the project or its
   community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or
   community include using an official project e-mail address, posting
   via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
   representative at an online or offline event.

That is, the Code of Conduct would not apply to someone saying "the QEMU 
SCSI maintainer rejected my patches, he is an idiot" on Twitter.  My 
proposal sought to find a middle ground, where that person could be 
reasonably considered to be "acting as a member of the project or its 
community".

There have been in the past cases of external people asking projects to 
ban contributors because of views they held on social media.  The 
Contributor Covenant initially included no limit to the application of 
the CoC and only added a limitation after the author herself was 
involved in such an episode[1][2].

I would prefer to avoid putting QEMU in that situation, and limit the 
applicability code of conduct as much as possible to conflicts within 
the community.

The Mozilla participation guidelines (2165 words :)) acknowledge that 
"it is possible for actions taken outside of Mozilla's online or in 
person spaces to have a deep impact on community health" but also admit 
that "this is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm"[3].

The Django code of conduct seems to be in the minority in having such a 
broad applicability, while the wording in the Contributor Covenant seems 
to be more informed by actual experience.
