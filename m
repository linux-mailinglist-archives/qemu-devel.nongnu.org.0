But I still don't undertand how QEMU could know about those tunnels, which
should be beyond QEMU's awareness?

The tunneling program can be some admin initiated socat tcp forwarding
programs, which by default may not allow >1 socket pairs.

Or maybe I have mis-understood on what's the tunneling we're discussing?

Ah I see.  I think Dave also mentioned it'll be a bit tricky to do so, but
it'll be at least sounds doable.

It's not a new one, it's just that a few years ago we exported the
migration capabilities to cmdline too (2081475841fe8), even if it's mostly
for debugging purpose.  In my daily tests it's quite handy.

Yeah sounds working, it's just that we need to have users of it first.  One
point is that exec shouldn't be used in production but for quick hacks or
experiments, so supporting new/perf/enhancement features for it sounds a
bit over-engineering unless explicitly useful.
