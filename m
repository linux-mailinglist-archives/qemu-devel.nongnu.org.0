Actually, after re-reading the code, it IS implemented this way. The=20
parent process when --fork is used does not exit until after the child=20
process closes its temporary stderr pipe to the parent, which is after=20
the socket has been set up and only right before beginning the main=20
event loop.  So when --fork is in use, waiting for the process to exit=20
is sufficient.

But when --fork is not in use (because you want to keep the qemu-nbd=20
process in the foreground for whatever reason), then --pid-file can=20
indeed serve as a witness when the single process has progressed far=20
enough to have the socket open.

At any rate, I'm less certain if it is worth trying to revive this=20
patch.  A doc-only change is still okay for 4.2-rc2, except that we have=20
to agree on what such a doc change should be and if it adds anything=20
useful to the reader.
