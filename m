yep, if we talk about generic approach, it's a problem.
But if a concrete combo of device/hotplug controller is considered
where such flow were necessary, it should be possible.

But from the my very limited understanding, on real hardware,
once device is uplugged it's gone (finalized) from machine
perspective, so it's unclear to my why someone would use
realize->unrealize->realize hotplug scenario.
