No, I'd mostly anticipated matching on the vendor and device and maybe a
version number for the bit the user specifies; I had assumed all that
'vendor cruft' was still mostly opaque; having said that, if it did
become a list of attributes like that (some of which were vendor
specific) that would make sense to me.
