Hm, yes. But we already agreed that dropping permissions should never
fail, so maybe we should just implement that now (in block.c).

=2E..and actually do s->open_flags =3D s->perm_change_flags in
raw_set_perm(), otherwise it doesn't help much. :-)

Good.

Yes, I think file-posix should let the operation fail (because it
actually failed) and the permission functions in block.c should ignore
the error for dropping permissions. This way, reopen will still
correctly return the error because it has a different call chain.
