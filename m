In the context of verifying backing file links, Jeff Cody once brought
up an idea where we would have something like a generation counter in
the header that would be increased every time you open the image
read-write. Then you could store that counter value in the backing file
and external data file links and detect if someone else wrote to the
child image and invalidated it.

Though obviously raw images still won't have a counter, and if they had
one, nobody would increase it when writing to it externally, so it
doesn't actually work for real-world external data files...

I wouldn't rely on file timestamps, you already mentioned some good
reasons.
