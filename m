I can translate the chat log for you:

<kevin> In theory that=E2=80=99s called qom-set
<kevin> However, I believe it doesn=E2=80=99t support qdev properties
<kevin> Hm, but that could be changed specifically for the drive property
<kevin> qdev keeps confusing me.  Drive isn=E2=80=99t supposed to call
qdev_prop_set_after_realize(), but the error message=E2=80=99s still there.
Where is that hidden call...?
<kevin> Ah, set_pointer() does
<kevin> Yes, then it should be possible to make that work rather locally

And that took him about 10 minutes.

So I suppose it would be to check in set_drive() and
set_drive_iothread() whether the device is already realized, and if so,
divert it to some other function that does the runtime change?

(No idea how the qdev maintainers think about doing that in set_drive()
and set_drive_iothread(), though)

Because we have blockdev-add, which supports all block device options
there are and so on.  blockdev-change-medium (which is basically just a
more rigid =E2=80=9Cchange=E2=80=9D) only gets filename, which isn=E2=80=99=
t as expressive.

We generally want users to add new nodes with blockdev-add and let all
other commands only take node-names.

(There=E2=80=99s also the fact that historically we=E2=80=99ve used filenam=
es to
identify BlockDriverStates, but that doesn=E2=80=99t work so well.  Thus I =
think
we should get away from using filenames as much as we can so people
don=E2=80=99t use them for identification again.)
