I think there needs to be an addition requirement.

 It must be possible for a management application to query the supported
 versions, independantly of execution of a migration  operation.

This is important to large scale data center / cloud management applications
because before initiating a migration they need to *automatically* select
a target host with high level of confidence that is will be compatible with
the source host.

Today QEMU migration compatibility is largely determined by the machine
type version. Apps can query the supported machine types for host to
check whether it is compatible. Similarly they will query CPU model
features to check compatiblity.

Validation and error checking at time of migration is of course still
required, but the goal should be that an mgmt application will *NEVER*
hit these errors because they will have pre-selected a host that is
known to be compatible based on reported versions that are supported.

The mechanism needs to be able to report all supported versions strings,
not simple the latest version string. I think we need to specify the
actual mechanism todo this query too, because we can't end up in a place
where there's a different approach to queries for each device type.
