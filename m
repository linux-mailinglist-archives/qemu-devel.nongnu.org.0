Per my understanding, a range with start = 0, size = 0x10000, is represented

    [0, 0xffff]

So if I have another range [0xffff, 0x1ffff], they seems to overlap. The range
[0x10000, 0x1ffff] doesn't overlap with [0, 0xffff].

My original comparison looks right. Do I miss some point?

Hmm... I think you are right.

I am afraid without Patch #2, the condition check is not that intuitive. Would
this bring some confusion for audience and maintenance?

I am not sure the percentage of occurrence when hint is provided, while the
generated code for check NULL is less than compare two values.
