Some renaming could help, perhaps not quite like the one above, but my
point (which I find hard to believe I can't explain to you) is that
peripherals inside the chip evolved over time, as starkly opposed to
external peripherals that are set in stone...

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 of course, whatever the surrounding system is.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 In AVR case, I think we have a phenomenon likes of which we d=
idn&#39;t<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 see before (at least I don&#39;t know about). Number of AVR<b=
r>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 microcontrollers is very large, and both cores and peripheral=
s evolved.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 For cores, you handle differences with all these AVR_FEATURE =
macros,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 and this seems to be working, no significant objection from m=
y side,<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 and btw that was not an easy task to execute, all admiration =
from me.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 But what about peripherals inside the chip? A peripheral with=
 the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 same name and the same general area of functionality may be<b=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 differently specified for microcontrollers from 2010 and 2018=
. By<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 the difference I don&#39;t mean starting address, but the dif=
ference in<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 behavior. I don&#39;t have time right now to spell many examp=
les, but I<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 read three different specs, and there are differences in USAR=
T<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 specifications.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I am not clear what is your envisioned solution for these cas=
es.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Would you such close, but not the same, flabors of a peripher=
al<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 treat as if they are two completely separate cases of a perip=
heral?<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Or would you have a single peripheral that would somehow conf=
igure<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 itself depending on the core it is attached to?<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 I hope I was clearer this time.<br>

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 as for the sample board is just a sample, I hop=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 will create real models or real hw.<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 there was no way I could provide a CPU alone, t=

If I understand Aleksandar correctly, the naming is incorrect because too g=
eneric to AVR family, why Sarah only modeled the Atmel implementation.<br>
<br>
Renaming devices such hw/char/avr_usart.c -&gt; hw/char/atmel_usart.c (simi=
larly with the macros) would be enough Aleksandar?<br>
