I should say the kernel's continual changing in CPU features that are
exposed has been responsible for a *huge* number of bugs with live
migration compatibility. libvirt, QEMU & apps have needed to introduce
a lot of extra code to try to cope with the changing CPU features across
migration and i still goes wrong to this very day, because we have to
migrate from prehistoric QEMU versions to quite modern versions.

IOW, the CPU features approach is a perfect example of why we should
*not* introduce a kernel dependancy in more areas of QEMU feature
enablement, and instead should strictly tie feature defaults to the
machine type versions.

Daniel
