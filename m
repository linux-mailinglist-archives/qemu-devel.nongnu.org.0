I apparently needed a weekend in between to get a clean head again. I
was doing indeed something wrong... apparently you have to name your
tasks on cirrus-ci with "_task" at the end. If you use "_task1" and
"_task2", it does now work anymore. Sigh.

So I'll try to cook a proper patch to split the job instead.
