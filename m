I don't think we're talking about the same thing. I was referring to the
difference between full file preallocation and the extent size hint in
XFS, and how the latter was faster with the shorter ramp time but that
swapped around when the test ramped up for longer. Here, it looks like
you're comparing XFS to ext4 writing direct to a file..

If I compare this 5m fio test between XFS and ext4 on a couple of my
systems (with either no prealloc or full file prealloc), I end up seeing
ext4 run slightly faster on my vm and XFS slightly faster on bare metal.
Either way, I don't see that huge disparity where ext4 is 5-6 times
faster than XFS. Can you describe the test, filesystem and storage in
detail where you observe such a discrepancy?
