it happens in vIOMMU Domain level invalidation of IOTLB
(domain-selective invalidation, see vtd_iotlb_domain_invalidate() in qemu).
common in VTD lazy mode, and NOT just happening once at boot time.
rather than invalidate page by page, it batches the page invalidation.
so, when this invalidation takes place, even higher level page tables
have been invalid and therefore it has to invalidate a bigger combined range.
That's why we see IOVAs are mapped in 4k pages, but are unmapped in 2M
pages.

I think those UNMAPs should also have GET_DIRTY_BIMTAP flag on, right?

in this case, iotlb->addr_mask in unmap is 0x200000 -1.
different than 0x1000 -1 used for map.

yes, please. also curious of log_sync part for vIOMMU. given most IOVAs in
address space are unmapped and therefore no IOTLBs are able to be found.
