They may eventually solve it. I would not let us hang up on this right now,
since as said at least in kubevirt we can't get rid right now of root
anyway.
Even if it is at some point in the future save and supported on
bleeding-edge managed k8s clusters to allow ordinary users to run with uid
0, from my perspective it is right now common to restrict namespaces with
PodSecurityPolicies or SecurityContexts to not allow running pods as root
for normal users.
It is also common that a significant part of the community users run docker
and/or run on managed k8s clusters where they can not influence if
user-namespaces are enabled, if they can run pods as root, if the runtime
points to a seccomp file they like or if the runtime they prefer is used.

But let me repeat again that we require root right now anyway and that we
don't run the pods right now with the user privileges (but we should and we
aim for that). Right now PSPs and SCCs restrict access to these pods by the
users.
So for our use case, at this exact moment root is acceptable, the unshare
call is a little bit more problematic.

Best Regards,
Roman

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes they can run as root. I can tell you what we plan to do w=
ith the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; containerized virtiofsd: We run it as part of the user-owned =
pod (a set of<br>

&gt; &gt;&gt; One of our main goals at the moment is to run VMs in a user-o=

&gt; &gt;&gt; without additional privileges.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; So that in case the user (VM-creator/owner) enters the pod or=
 something<br>

&gt; &gt;&gt; As part of that we try to get also rid of running containers =

&gt; &gt;&gt; One possible scenario which I could think of as being desirab=

&gt; &gt;&gt; We would run the VM in one container and have an unprivileged=
