> My understanding is that this is the expected behavior. The reason is
that the drive cannot be deleted immediately when the device is hot-
unplugged, since it might not be safe (other parts of QEMU could be
using it, like background block jobs).

> On the other hand, the fact that if the drive is removed explicitly
through QMP (or in the monitor with drive_del), the drive id is remains
"in use". This might be a completely different bug that is unrelated to
the nvme device.

using the same commands I can hot-plug and hot-unplug a scsi disk like
this without issue - this behavior only appeared on nvme devices.

Title:
  nvme disk cannot be hotplugged after removal

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Hello,

  When I try to re-add an nvme disk shortly after removing it, I get an
  error about duplicate ID.

  See the following commands to reproduce. This happens consistently on
  all VMs that I tested:

  =

  attach
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

  $VAR1 =3D {
            'arguments' =3D> {
                             'command-line' =3D> 'drive_add auto "file=3D/d=
ev/zvol/rpool/data/vm-20000-disk-1,if=3Dnone,id=3Ddrive-nvme1,format=3Draw,=
cache=3Dnone,aio=3Dnative,detect-zeroes=3Don"'
                           },
            'execute' =3D> 'human-monitor-command'
          };
  $VAR1 =3D {
            'execute' =3D> 'device_add',
            'arguments' =3D> {
                             'serial' =3D> 'nvme1',
                             'drive' =3D> 'drive-nvme1',
                             'driver' =3D> 'nvme',
                             'id' =3D> 'nvme1'
                           }
          };

  =

  detach
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  $VAR1 =3D {
            'arguments' =3D> {
                             'id' =3D> 'nvme1'
                           },
            'execute' =3D> 'device_del'
          };
  $VAR1 =3D {
            'execute' =3D> 'human-monitor-command',
            'arguments' =3D> {
                             'command-line' =3D> 'drive_del drive-nvme1'
                           }
          };

  reattach
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  $VAR1 =3D {
            'arguments' =3D> {
                             'command-line' =3D> 'drive_add auto "file=3D/d=
ev/zvol/rpool/data/vm-20000-disk-1,if=3Dnone,id=3Ddrive-nvme1,format=3Draw,=
cache=3Dnone,aio=3Dnative,detect-zeroes=3Don"'
                           },
            'execute' =3D> 'human-monitor-command'
          };

  =

  and I get:
  "Duplicate ID 'drive-nvme1' for drive"

  although it does not show up in query-block or query-pci anymore after
  the first detach.

  =

  Is this a bug or am I missing something? Please advise.

  Best regards,
  Oguz
