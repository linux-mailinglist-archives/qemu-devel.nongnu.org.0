Strictly speaking there's no client/server implementation yet as we're wait=
ing
until the protocol is finalized.

The closest server implementation we have is an NVMe controller implemented=
 in
SPDK with MUSER:
(https://github.com/tmakatos/spdk/tree/rfc-vfio-over-socket and
https://github.com/tmakatos/muser/tree/vfio-over-socket).

The closest client implementation we have is libvfio in the VFIO-over-socke=
t
PoC.

Neither of these implementation use the new protocol, but they're similar i=
n
spirit.

John is working on the VFIO changes, the only thing left to do is the DMA/I=
OMMU
changes we made in the last review round, they'll be on their GitHub site s=
oon.

Sure, we'll come up with something similar based on those.

I'm not sure I understand, do you mean we should add something like the
following (right below "Version 0.1"):

"Refer to section 1.2.3 on how versioning works."

?

OK, we'll add the rule as per your recommendation.

"vfio-user" it is.

Correct, QEMU is simply our main use case but the protocol is agnostic to t=
hat.
We'll drop QEMU and rephrase based on your suggestion.

Passing of file descriptors isn't necessary. We explain that later in
"Guest Memory Configuration" and we'll also state it here for clarity.

Indeed, this is confusing, we use the term "command" earlier in the
"VFIO Device Model" section, we'll replace the term "request"
with "command" throughout the specification.

All commands are executed in the order they were sent, regardless of whethe=

reply is needed.

For instance, a client can issue the following operations back to back with=
out
waiting for the first two to complete:
1. map a DMA region=20
2. trigger some device-specific operation that results in data being read i=
nto
   that DMA region, and
3. unmap the DMA region

Regarding recovering state, I believe that since all the building blocks ar=
e
there and the client is pretty much the master in the vfio-user model, it's=
 up
to the client how to deal with exceptional situations. For recovery to work=
, the
client will have to reconfigure IRQs, DMAs, etc., and the server will have =
to
persistently store device state.

Regarding how disconnect maps to VFIO device types, it depends on whether o=
r not
the client/server can recover from it and continue operating. If this doesn=
't
happen (e.g. the server hasn't restarted, the client doesn't support
recovering), then the device cannot continue being operational, which I sup=
pose
is an implementation detail of the client.

Do we need something more specific at this stage?

No, it's array were each element can be any object in JSON.

It was suggested to include it as a sanity check, we'll drop it.

Good point, it is per-session since we're dropping the device ID from the
header. I suppose this means that if in a future version we want to support
devices sharing the same connection the header will have to be extended to
include the device ID.

The VFIO kernel driver returns EEXIST if mapping over an existing area
and allows unmapping a subset. I'd think we should follow their example.

Regarding receiving a DMA unmap request while there is an ongoing DMA
transaction, once the server ACK's the DMA unmap then it must not touch tha=
t DMA
region. It is an implementation detail whether the server waits for the DMA=
 to
finish or kills the DMA operation, which might not be possible at all (e.g =
part
of that region has been submitted for I/O to a physical device).

>=20
> What is the format of the reply to this message?

It's just the header explained in the "Header" section, no additional data =
are
sent by the server, it simply ACK's the command.

Because it is optional in VFIO, too.

Indeed, I forgot about padding. We can remove the reference to struct iovec=
 or
make count 8 bytes?
