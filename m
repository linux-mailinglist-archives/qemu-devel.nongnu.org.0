There's no need to do that now. I think it only makes sense to do that 
when the 686B and VT8231 models are also qdevified (which I'll plan to do 
when cleaning up my pegasos2 patches later) since that may change how this 
should be qdevified. But I don't have time to fully do it now so don't 
even ask. This will have to do for now as it's not worse than it is 
already and does fix clients so I see no immediate need to force more 
clean ups upon me.

No, the feature bit is still needed to flag if this device should work 
with 100% native mode as on fulong2e or with forced legacy IRQ non-100% 
native mode as on pegasos2. In both cases PCI_CLASS_PROG is actually set 
to native mode (most of the time, Linux fixes this up on pegasos2 for it's 
own convenience but other OSes don't care about it but we still need to 
know to use legacy interrupts) so the feature bit is needed to know when 
to use legacy and when native interrupts.

The hardcoded IRQ14 in native mode is also wrong, If you check VT8231 
datasheet it clearly says that the IRQ raised is selected by 
PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE so I think my previous version was correct but this 
still works because we fixed PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE to 14 so we know here it's 
14 without looking at the config reg that you forbid me to do. But due to 
coincidence it still works and matches your ideals about PCI specs that I 
don't think apply for this device but I could not convince you about that 
so if this is what it takes then so be it. As long as it works with 
clients I don't care, we can always clean this up later.

This seems to work but originally I did not want to touch anything that 
could break other parts so I did not investigate this further. Thanks for 
the suggestion, I've added this patch in v3 and removed workaround from 
via-ide.

I don't see a need to add another one line patch for this here unless 
someone authorative asks for that. This is needed to allow Linux on 
pegasos2 to use this reg to signal its driver that it should use legacy 
interrupts. That is, while everything else is using native mode and this 
reg should also say that the pegasos2 fixup function of Linux sets this 
reg to legacy mode so it knows later that legacy interrupts should be used 
on this board. Therefore we need to allow this change.
