I just don't understand why 99.9% of it were okay to do, but the final
bit that would make the switch a lot more seamless to people is asking
too much. You're familiar with the state after your patches, I'm not. I
assume you're also the one who sends the pull request, and anything
developed after that pull request will mean that people will already
be impacted.

If you ask me to do pause my work, instead familiarise myself with your
work and do that final bit so that you can then include it in your pull
request, I'm sure your employer will pay for more time being spent
rather than less.

Kevin
