The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Usermode networking hostfwd only listens on IPv4

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When forwarding ports in usermode networking (-net user,hostfwd=3D),
  QEMU binds to IPv4 only. Therefore, connecting to the port over IPv6
  results in 'connection refused'.

  I experienced this in QEMU 2.10.1, but it looks to still be present in
  the current master (861cd431c99e56ddb5953ca1da164a9c32b477ca), since
  slirp_hostfwd in net/slirp.c uses in_addr instead of in6_addr.
