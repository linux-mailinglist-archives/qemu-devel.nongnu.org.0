Ok, so I infer that you based this idea on the "--compat-policy"
arg used to control behaviour wrt to deprecations.

With the deprecation support, the QAPI introspection data can
report deprecations for machines / CPUs (and in theory devices
later).  Libvirt records this deprecation info and can report
it to the user before even starting a guest, so they can avoid
using a deprecated device in the first place.  We also use this
info to mark a guest as tainted + deprecation at the libvirt
level and let mgmt apps query this status.

The --compat-policy support has been integrated into libvirt
but it is not something we expect real world deployments to
use - rather it is targeted as a testing framework.

Essentially I see the security reporting as needing to operate
in a pretty similar manner.

IOW, the reporting via QAPI introspetion is much more important
for libvirt and mgmt apps, than any custom cli arg / printfs
at the QEMU level.


In terms of QAPI design we currently have

   'deprecated': 'bool'

field against MachineInfo and CpuDefinitionInfo types.

it feels like we need

   'secure': 'bool'

field against the relevant types here too, though I think
maybe we might need to make it an optional field  to let
us distinguish lack of information, since it will take a
long time to annotate all areas. eg

   '*secure': 'bool'

 - not set  => no info available on security characteristics
 - true => device is considered secure wrt malicious guest
 - false => device is not considered secure wrt malicious guest
