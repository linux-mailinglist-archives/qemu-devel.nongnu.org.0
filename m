If all we needs is NUMA affinity, not CPU affinity, then it would
be sufficient to create 1 I/O thread per host NUMA node that the
VM needs to use. The job running in the I/O can spawn further
threads and inherit the NUMA affinity.  This might be more clever
than it is needed though.

I expect creating/deleting I/O threads is cheap in comparison to
the work done for preallocation. If libvirt is using -preconfig
and object-add to create the memory backend, then we could have
option of creating the I/O threads dynamically in -preconfig mode,
create the memory backend, and then delete the I/O threads again.

Yep, we don't especially need an "ownership" relationship for what
we want todo with preallocatino, specially because it is a one
off point-in-time usage, not continuous usage as with block devices

With regards,
Daniel
