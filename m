We don't want to create such images, but we want to keep our code as
simple as possible.

As your patch shows, forbidding the case is more work than just allowing
it. So if external software can create such images, and it would just
automatically work in QEMU, then why do the extra work to articifially
forbid this?

(Actually, it's likely that on the first header update, QEMU would just
end up dropping the useless flag, so we even "fix" such images.)

I was trying too check what the condition is under which the field will
be present in the output, but I couldn't find any code for it.

So it looks like this patch never makes use of the field and it's dead
code?
