When extending the size of an image that has a backing file larger than
its old size, make sure that the backing file data doesn't become
visible in the guest, but the added area is properly zeroed out.

The old behaviour made a difference in 'block_resize' (where showing the
backing file data from an old snapshot rather than zeros is
questionable) as well as in commit block jobs (both from active and
intermediate nodes) and HMP 'commit', where committing to a short
backing file would incorrectly omit writing zeroes for unallocated
blocks on the top layer after the EOF of the short backing file.
