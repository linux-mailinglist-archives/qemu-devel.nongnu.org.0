Even without migration, now under SeaBIOS probably most IDE disks
report 255 heads and 63 spts due to LBA translation, while exposing
up to 16 physical heads (IDE spec).
So you can=E2=80=99t really report in ATA identify command your wanted =
logical
heads (255).

This can be solved in a very complicated way:

For virtio-blk disks - report bios geometries as physical geometries.
This might break current compatibility (showing different physical =
geometries)
For scsi disks - report bios geometries as physical geometries.
Implement MODE_PAGE_FLEXIBLE_DISK_GEOMETRY and translation=3Dnone - this =
new interface will help with compatibility
For IDE disks - specially craft valid physical geometries (heads <=3D =
16) with a specific translation,
This is super complicated, for example to make an IDE disk report lchs =
of 32 heads, 56 spts, you need a physical geometry of 16 heads, 56 spts =
and report 2046 cylinders with a "large" translation - which will =
effectively cut down the number of cylinders by 2 to 1023 and multiply =
the heads by 2 to 32, achieving the desired lchs. Also we can not even =
make an IDE report 255 heads with 56 spts with any translation (this is =
an actual value from production) - so the disk must be moved to =
scsi-hd/virtio-blk - which also breaks compatibility.

This implementation creates 3 different non conventional (PV) ways of =
reporting lchs directly between Qemu and SeaBIOS - which add a lot of =
technical depth for resolving a legacy issue. A fw-cfg value named =
=E2=80=9Cbootdevices=E2=80=9D (or =E2=80=9Cbios-geometry=E2=80=9D) is =
much more straightforward and makes it more readable/explicit.

WDYT?
