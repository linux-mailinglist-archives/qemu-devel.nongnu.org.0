Callers for these two functions:

block-backend.c:blk_do_pwritev_part() - currently passes unsigned int

filter-compress.c:compress_co_preadv_part() - passes uint64_t from 
.bdrv_co_preadv_part, which in turn is called from:
  - io.c:bdrv_driver_preadv() - callers analyzed earlier this series, 
where we know we are currently capped at <2G
  - qcow2-cluster.c:do_perform_cow_read() - passes size_t qiov->size, 
but we further know qcow2 cow is limited to cluster size of 2M
  - qcow2.c:qcow2_load_vmstate() - passes size_t qiov->size, tracing 
whether that ever exceeds 32 bits (on 64-bit platforms) is harder

filter-compress.c:compress_co_pwritev_part() - ditto, but for 
.bdrv_co_pwritev_part, which in turn is called from:
  - io.c:bdrv_driver_pwritev() - callers analyzed earlier this series, 
where we know we are currently capped at <2G
  - qcow2.c:qcow2_save_vmstate() - passes size_t qiov->size, tracing 
whether that ever exceeds 32 bits (on 64-bit platforms) is harder

io.c:bdrv_co_preadv() - currently passes unsigned int

io.c:bdrv_co_pwritev() - currently passes unsigned int

qcow2.c:qcow2_co_preadv_task() - passes uint64_t from 
qcow2_co_preadv_part(), which in turn is called from:
  - .bdrv_co_preadv_part - analyzed above

qcow2.c:qcow2_co_pwritev_task() - passes uint64_t from 
qcow2_co_pwritev_part(), which in turn is called from:
  - .bdrv_co_pwritev_part - analyzed above
  - qcow2_co_truncate() - passes uint64_t but it is clamped to 1 
cluster, at most 2M

In summary, it looks like even with our new 64-bit bytes parameter, most 
(all?) callers are still clamped to 32 bits.  But if we later relax 
callers, we want to see how bytes is used within these functions.

Callers:
bdrv_do_preadv_part() - adjusted to int64_t in this patch
bdrv_do_pwritev_part() - adjusted to int64_t in this patch

Usage:
     if (!bdrv_init_padding(bs, *offset, *bytes, pad)) {
  - takes int64_t, but now has to be checked for 64-bit safety below

     qemu_iovec_init_extended(&pad->local_qiov, pad->buf, pad->head,
                              *qiov, *qiov_offset, *bytes,
                              pad->buf + pad->buf_len - pad->tail, 
pad->tail);
  - takes size_t, risky on 32-bit platforms if any of our callers ever 
pass in a value larger than 32 bits.  I'd feel much better with an 
assertion that bytes <= SIZE_MAX.

     *bytes += pad->head + pad->tail;
  - corner-case risk of overflow for an image near 63-bit limits (nbdkit 
can generate such an image, but real images do not tickle this); the 
risk can be mitigated if we insist that no images are larger than 
QEMU_ALIGN_DOWN(INT64_MAX, request_alignment), as we would be unable to 
access the unaligned tail bytes of such an image


bdrv_init_padding():
     sum = pad->head + bytes + pad->tail;
  - ouch: this sets 'size_t sum' to what has always been an int64_t 
parameter, but which prior to this patch was initialized by callers 
passing 32-bit values (with this patch, callers now pass in actual 
int64_t).  But even pre-patch, there are values of bytes that fit in 32 
bits but where this sum can overflow on 32-bit platforms, with that 
potential overflow not changed here.  We need a separate patch to fix 
this (sum needs to be int64_t), preferably earlier in the series. (patch 
6/17 also mentioned bdrv_init_padding as needing a fix)

Callers:
bdrv_co_preadv_part() - adjusted this patch
bdrv_rw_co_entry() called by bdrv_prwv_co called by:
  - bdrv_pwrite_zeroes() - int bytes
  - bdrv_pwritev() - size_t bytes from qiov
  - bdrv_preadv() - size_t bytes from qiov

This fixes a latent issue where pre-patch callers could pass size_t and 
suffer truncation on a 64-bit platform; but in practice we never tickled 
that bug because of our insistence on <2G read/write.

takes int64_t (patch 3/17 in this series), and ensures the transaction 
is <2G for the rest of the function. If we ever relax 
bdrv_check_byte_request, we also have to worry about:

Interesting that the trace always took 64-bit numbers, but you are 
renaming it to match the fact that they are now called from different 
functions (since commit 1acc3466a2).  I'd feel better if 'flags' were 
kept unsigned int, even though semantically it doesn't matter.

I think if you fix bdrv_init_padding in a separate patch, then 
everything else here is safe.
