Unfortunately there is no kernel API which we can use on the host to say
"give me inodes and offsets which will fit into a 32 bit field". The
'getdents' syscall uses the "unsigned long" type for the d_ino and d_off
fields, so on a 64-bit host these will be the same size as the ino64_t
and off64_t used by 'getdents64', and you will still have the "trying to
fit a quart into a pint pot" problem.

The only way to fix this is to fix the host kernel to provide the API
QEMU needs for this (see discussion in the kernel thread linked to in
comment #5).

Title:
  readdir() returns NULL (errno=3DEOVERFLOW) for 32-bit user-static qemu
  on 64-bit host

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  This can be simply reproduced by compiling and running the attached C
  code (readdir-bug.c) under 32-bit user-static qemu, such as qemu-arm-
  static:

  # Setup docker for user-static binfmt
  docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
  # Compile the code and run (readdir for / is fine, so create a new direct=
ory /test).
  docker run -v /path/to/qemu-arm-static:/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static -v /path/=
to/readdir-bug.c:/tmp/readdir-bug.c -it --rm arm32v7/ubuntu:18.10 bash -c '=
{ apt update && apt install -y gcc; } >&/dev/null && mkdir -p /test && cd /=
test && gcc /tmp/readdir-bug.c && ./a.out'
  dir=3D0xff5b4150
  readdir(dir)=3D(nil)
  errno=3D75: Value too large for defined data type

  Do remember to replace the /path/to/qemu-arm-static and /path/to
  /readdir-bug.c to the actual paths of the files.

  The root cause is in glibc:
  https://sourceware.org/git/?p=3Dglibc.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dsysdeps/unix/sysv/=
linux/getdents.c;h=3D6d09a5be7057e2792be9150d3a2c7b293cf6fc34;hb=3Da5275ba5=
378c9256d18e582572b4315e8edfcbfb#l87

  By C standard, the return type of readdir() is DIR*, in which the
  inode number and offset are 32-bit integers, therefore, glibc calls
  getdents64() and check if the inode number and offset fits the 32-bit
  range, and reports EOVERFLOW if not.

  The problem here is for 32-bit user-static qemu running on 64-bit
  host, getdents64 simply passing through the inode number and offset
  from underlying getdents64 syscall (from 64-bit kernel), which is very
  likely to not fit into 32-bit range. On real hardware, the 32-bit
  kernel creates 32-bit inode numbers, therefore works properly.

  The glibc code makes sense to do the check to be conformant with C
  standard, therefore ideally it should be a fix on qemu side. I admit
  this is difficult because qemu has to maintain a mapping between
  underlying 64-bit inode numbers and 32-bit inode numbers, which would
  severely hurt the performance. I don't expect this could be fix
  anytime soon (or even there would be a fix), but it would be
  worthwhile to surface this issue.
