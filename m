In this series I restrict Clocks to 1/ qdev and 2/ MachineState (which
is the case you described). I tried to think about all the hardware I
worked with and all could be somehow modeled as qdev.

Yes, that would simplify few things. I might try it.

Expanding the topic, this reminds me a discussion between Igor and Mark
about MemoryRegion...

One was about we can not change the NULL owner to MachineState
because the region could be migrated and there is a mismatch.

Another was about preparing the design for multi-arch machines, Mark was
confuse by having owner for memory regions such DRAM because on a board
they aren't owned, can be used by various masters (CPUs, DMA). So the
machine should be the owner somehow. Maybe the problem was with
migration indeed, I can't remember :S

Regards,

Phil.
