The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Windows XP slow on Apple M1

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Qemu installed by using brew install qemu -s on M1

  QEMU emulator version 5.2.0
  XP image from: https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86

  Commands run:
  $ qemu-img create -f qcow2 xpsp3.img 10G
  $ qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -hda xpsp3.img -cdrom WinXPProSP3x86/en_windows=
_xp_professional_with_service_pack_3_x86_cd_vl_x14-73974.iso -boot d

  It's taken 3 days now with qemu running at around 94% CPU and
  installation hasn't finished. The mouse pointer moves and occasionally
  changes between the pointer and hourglass so it doesn't seem to have
  frozen.
