The way a plugin works is by linking. The plugin itself would be useless
unless combined with the QEMU code to do its thing. It is a more
intimate binding than an IPC interface using some sort of protocol. The
argument goes that pretty much any kernel module is derived code - but
again it has never really been litigated in the courts which would be
the people to set the precedent.

If someone were to do that it would depend on a copyright holder (i.e.
one of us) being willing to challenge that licensing. AIUI GCC used
additional language in the runtime exception clause:

  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1.html

which only allows use of the runtime exception if the code has gone
through GPL compatible code:

  A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
  with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
  work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
  optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
  Eligible Compilation Process.

Well the first thing will be we are not intending to offer a guaranteed
ABI. While we don't want to be changing it at a whim there shouldn't be
an expectation that the plugin interface will maintain backwards
compatibility (unlike the command line interface ;-). There should be an
expectation that plugins will likely need to be rebuilt against the
current source tree from time to time.

We could implement a more technical measure analogous to the kernels
module signing that would require the plugin to be rebuilt with
reference to the current QEMU source tree although that will be a pain
even for internally distributed blobs. I'm loathed to implement such a
system from v1 though given the problem of publicly distributed binary
blobs is currently only a theoretical problem.
