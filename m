(1) is for mdev devices specifically, and (2) is provided to keep the same
sysfs interface as with non-mdev cases. so (2) is for both mdev devices and
non-mdev devices.

in future, if we enable vfio-pci vendor ops, (i.e. a non-mdev device
is binding to vfio-pci, but is able to register migration region and do
migration transactions from a vendor provided affiliate driver),
the vendor driver would export (2) directly, under device node.
It is not able to provide (1) as there're no mdev devices involved.

no. (2) does not reply on (1).

I think it can completely reply on (2) if compatibility check before
mdev creation is not required.

yes, I think so.

Yes, I have the same feeling. but as (2) is for sysfs interface
consistency, to make it transparent to userspace tools like libvirt,
I guess the same name is necessary?
