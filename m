I'm just not very sure what this assertion means.

This assertion is checking that we're not trying to fit too
large a value into the host PPC branch instruction we just emitted.
That is, tcg_out_bc() emits a PPC conditional branch instruction,
which has a 14 bit field for the offset (it's a relative branch),
and we know the bottom 2 bits of the target will be 0 (PPC insns
being 4-aligned), so the distance between the current host PC
and the target of the branch must fit in a signed 16-bit field.

"disp" here stands for "displacement".

The PPC TCG backend only uses this for the TCG 'brcond' and
'brcond2' TCG intermediate-representation ops. It seems likely
that the code for your target is generating TCG ops which have
too large a gap between a brcond/brcond2 and the destination label.
You could try using the various QEMU -d options to print out the
guest instructions and the generated TCG ops to pin down what
part of your target is trying to generate branches over too
much code like this.

In this case it isn't necessarily directly an endianness issue.
The x86 instruction set provides conditional branch instructions
which allow a 32-bit displacement value, so you're basically never
going to overflow a conditional-branch there. PPC, being RISC,
has more limited branch insns. You might also run into this
if you tried to use aarch64 (64-bit) arm hosts, which are
little-endian but have a 19-bit branch displacement limit,
depending on just how big you've managed to make your jumps.
On the other hand, a 16-bit displacement is a jump over
64K of generated code, which is huge for a single TCG
generated translation block, so it could well be that you
have an endianness bug in your TCG frontend which is causing
you to generate an enormous TB by accident.
