I thought about this, but decided that double error propagation is a strang=
e pattern, and may be better not match it...

ah yes, we can propagate to already filled errp, which just clean local_err=
.

I think not, as it will anyway match functions with error_prepend (and any
number of following error_propagate calls)...
