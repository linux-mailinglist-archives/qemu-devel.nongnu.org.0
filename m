Can we treat optimizations for speed problems as bug fixes if they land 
after soft freeze but before -rc1?

At any rate, this post reminds me that Vladimir's series to support 
64-bit actions elsewhere has probably slipped into 5.2 territory, but I 
still need to fix the fact that nbd is sending uint32_t trim/zero values 
into signed int block layer functions (Vladimir's work is nicer but 
harder to review, so I'll probably end up writing one-off patches for 
5.1 with minimal churn to just block/nbd.c rather than the whole block 
layer...)
