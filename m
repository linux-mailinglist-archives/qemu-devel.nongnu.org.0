You're right; I got confused.

Well, we do have qbus_reset_all() & friends reset buses and devices in
post order.  That's a model, isn't it?  I guess it can't model *all*
dependencies.  Still, shouldn't we use it wherever it actually suffices?

hw/input/pckbd.c is instructive.  The qemu_register_reset() in
i8042_mm_init() is inded for a non-qdevified device.  The one in
i8042_realizefn() has no such excuse.

Does not contradict what you wrote, of course.  Still, shouldn't we at
least get rid of the latter kind?

I'm afraid *any* improvement will have an impact on reset ordering.
Most reorderings will be just fine.  How terrible could the
less-than-fine ones be?

We could replace the special case "bus's parent is null" by the special
case "bus's parent is a machine instead of a device", but I'm not sure
what exactly it would buy us.
