I'm sure you've done it countless times, just not knowingly :)

It is.

If I didn't find "console script" so thoroughly misguided, I'd advie you
to stick to it just because it's what we found in Python's docs.  It's
misguided, because this entry point is the one and only entry point for
*any* kind of Python executable program, be it console, GUI, or
whatever.
