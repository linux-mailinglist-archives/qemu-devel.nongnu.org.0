Seriously? Is your downstream QEMU so divergent from upstream that you
wouldn't notice something like this? I think you really have to improve
something there.

I mean, we have a serious data corruptor in the 4.1 release and I wasted
days to debug this, and you've been sitting on a fix for months without
telling anyone? This isn't a memory leak or something, this kills
people's images. It's eating their data.

Modifying an image format driver requires utmost care and I think I'll
try to make sure to allow only few qcow2 changes per release in the
future. Too many changes were made in too short time, and with too
little care, and there are even more qcow2 patches pending. Please check
whether these series actually match your downstream code. Anyway, we'll
tread very carefully now with the pending patches, even if it means
delaying them for another release or two. Stability is way more
important for an image format driver than new features and
optimisations.

Do whatever you need to fix your downstream process, but seriously, this
must not ever happen again.

Kevin
