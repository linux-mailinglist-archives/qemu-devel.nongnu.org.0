Hi, Pankaj

Thanks for your comment.

User could choose the type (devdax/fsdax) in ndctl command line with -m
option.

I don't get your point. Here is an example to let user know how to create
persistent backend. In case they want to get more control about the backend,
they can refer to the ndctl link. 

You mean it is not proper to mention the backend setup example in the
document? We found many users come to us for how to setup it, so we decide to
add this section.

Do you have other option?
