yes it is bad, but sometimes inevitable. If you recall our discussions
back to 3yrs (when discussing the 1st mdev framework), there were similar
hypervisor dependencies in GVT-g, e.g. querying gpa->hpa when
creating some shadow structures. gpa->hpa is definitely hypervisor
specific knowledge, which is easy in KVM (gpa->hva->hpa), but needs
hypercall in Xen. but VFIO already makes assumption based on KVM-
only flavor when implementing vfio_{un}pin_page_external. So GVT-g
has to maintain an internal abstraction layer to support both Xen and
KVM. Maybe someday we will re-consider introducing some hypervisor
abstraction layer in VFIO, if this issue starts to hurt other devices and
Xen guys are willing to support VFIO.

Back to this IOVA issue, I discussed with Yan and we found another=20
hypervisor-agnostic alternative, by learning from vhost. vhost is very
similar to VFIO - DMA also happens in the kernel, while it already=20
supports vIOMMU.

Generally speaking, there are three paths of dirty page collection
in Qemu so far (as previously noted, Qemu always tracks the dirty
bitmap in GFN):

1) Qemu-tracked memory writes (e.g. emulated DMAs). Dirty bitmaps=20
are updated directly when the guest memory is being updated. For=20
example, PCI writes are completed through pci_dma_write, which=20
goes through vIOMMU to translate IOVA into GPA and then update=20
the bitmap through cpu_physical_memory_set_dirty_range.

2) Memory writes that are not tracked by Qemu are collected by
registering .log_sync() callback, which is invoked in the dirty logging
process. Now there are two users: kvm and vhost.

  2.1) KVM tracks CPU-side memory writes, through write-protection
or EPT A/D bits (+PML). This part is always based on GFN and returned
to Qemu when kvm_log_sync is invoked;

  2.2) vhost tracks kernel-side DMA writes, by interpreting vring
data structure. It maintains an internal iotlb which is synced with
Qemu vIOMMU through a specific interface:
	- new vhost message type (VHOST_IOTLB_UPDATE/INVALIDATE)
for Qemu to keep vhost iotlb in sync
	- new VHOST_IOTLB_MISS message to notify Qemu in case of
a miss in vhost iotlb.
	- Qemu registers a log buffer to kernel vhost driver. The latter
update the buffer (using internal iotlb to get GFN) when serving vring
descriptor.

VFIO could also implement an internal iotlb, so vendor drivers can
utilize the iotlb to update the GFN-based dirty bitmap. Ideally we
don't need re-invent another iotlb protocol as vhost does. vIOMMU
already sends map/unmap ioctl cmds upon any change of IOVA
mapping. We may introduce a v2 map/unmap interface, allowing
Qemu to pass both {iova, gpa, hva} together to keep internal iotlb
in-sync. But we may also need a iotlb_miss_upcall interface, if VFIO
doesn't want to cache full-size vIOMMU mappings.=20

Definitely this alternative needs more work and possibly less=20
performant (if maintaining a small size iotlb) than straightforward
calling into KVM interface. But the gain is also obvious, since it
is fully constrained with VFIO.

Thoughts? :-)

Thanks
