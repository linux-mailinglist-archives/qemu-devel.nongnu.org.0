GDB remote protocol supports reverse debugging of the targets.
It includes 'reverse step' and 'reverse continue' operations.
The first one finds the previous step of the execution,
and the second one is intended to stop at the last breakpoint that
would happen when the program is executed normally.

Reverse debugging is possible in the replay mode, when at least
one snapshot was created at the record or replay phase.
QEMU can use these snapshots for travelling back in time with GDB.

Running the execution in replay mode allows using GDB reverse debugging
commands:
 - reverse-stepi (or rsi): Steps one instruction to the past.
   QEMU loads on of the prior snapshots and proceeds to the desired
   instruction forward. When that step is reaches, execution stops.
 - reverse-continue (or rc): Runs execution "backwards".
   QEMU tries to find breakpoint or watchpoint by loaded prior snapshot
   and replaying the execution. Then QEMU loads snapshots again and
   replays to the latest breakpoint. When there are no breakpoints in
   the examined section of the execution, QEMU finds one more snapshot
   and tries again. After the first snapshot is processed, execution
   stops at this snapshot.

The set of patches include the following modifications:
 - gdbstub update for reverse debugging support
 - functions that automatically perform reverse step and reverse
   continue operations
 - hmp/qmp commands for manipulating the replay process
 - improvement of the snapshotting for saving the execution step
   in the snapshot parameters

The patches are available in the repository:
