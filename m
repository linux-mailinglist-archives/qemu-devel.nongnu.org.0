=0D
When QMP was first introduced some 10+ years ago now, the snapshot=0D
related commands (savevm/loadvm/delvm) were not converted. This was=0D
primarily because their implementation causes blocking of the thread=0D
running the monitor commands. This was (and still is) considered=0D
undesirable behaviour both in HMP and QMP.=0D
=0D
In theory someone was supposed to fix this flaw at some point in the=0D
past 10 years and bring them into the QMP world. Sadly, thus far it=0D
hasn't happened as people always had more important things to work=0D
on. Enterprise apps were much more interested in external snapshots=0D
than internal snapshots as they have many more features.=0D
=0D
Meanwhile users still want to use internal snapshots as there is=0D
a certainly simplicity in having everything self-contained in one=0D
image, even though it has limitations. Thus the apps that end up=0D
executing the savevm/loadvm/delvm via the "human-monitor-command"=0D
QMP command.=0D
=0D
IOW, the problematic blocking behaviour that was one of the reasons=0D
for not having savevm/loadvm/delvm in QMP is experienced by applications=0D
regardless. By not portting the commands to QMP due to one design flaw,=0D
we've forced apps and users to suffer from other design flaws of HMP (=0D
bad error reporting, strong type checking of args, no introspection) for=0D
an additional 10 years. This feels rather sub-optimal :-(=0D
=0D
In practice users don't appear to care strongly about the fact that these=
=0D
commands block the VM while they run. I might have seen one bug report=0D
about it, but it certainly isn't something that comes up as a frequent=0D
topic except among us QEMU maintainers. Users do care about having=0D
access to the snapshot feature.=0D
=0D
Where I am seeing frequent complaints is wrt the use of OVMF combined=0D
with snapshots which has some serious pain points. This is getting worse=0D
as the push to ditch legacy BIOS in favour of UEFI gain momentum both=0D
across OS vendors and mgmt apps. Solving it requires new parameters to=0D
the commands, but doing this in HMP is super unappealing.=0D
=0D
After 10 years, I think it is time for us to be a little pragmatic about=0D
our handling of snapshots commands. My desire is that libvirt should never=
=0D
use "human-monitor-command" under any circumstances, because of the=0D
inherant flaws in HMP as a protocol for machine consumption.=0D
=0D
Thus in this series I'm proposing a fairly direct mapping of the existing=
=0D
HMP commands for savevm/loadvm/delvm into QMP as a first step. This does=0D
not solve the blocking thread problem, but it does put in a place a=0D
design using the jobs framework which can facilitate solving it later.=0D
It does also solve the error reporting, type checking and introspection=0D
problems inherant to HMP. So we're winning on 3 out of the 4 problems,=0D
and pushed apps to a QMP design that will let us solve the last=0D
remaining problem.=0D
=0D
With a QMP variant, we reasonably deal with the problems related to OVMF:=
=0D
=0D
 - The logic to pick which disk to store the vmstate in is not=0D
   satsifactory.=0D
=0D
   The first block driver state cannot be assumed to be the root disk=0D
   image, it might be OVMF varstore and we don't want to store vmstate=0D
   in there.=0D
=0D
 - The logic to decide which disks must be snapshotted is hardwired=0D
   to all disks which are writable=0D
=0D
   Again with OVMF there might be a writable varstore, but this can be=0D
   raw rather than qcow2 format, and thus unable to be snapshotted.=0D
   While users might wish to snapshot their varstore, in some/many/most=0D
   cases it is entirely uneccessary. Users are blocked from snapshotting=0D
   their VM though due to this varstore.=0D
=0D
These are solved by adding two parameters to the commands. The first is=0D
a block device node name that identifies the image to store vmstate in,=0D
and the second is a list of node names to include for the snapshots.=0D
If the list of nodes isn't given, it falls back to the historical=0D
behaviour of using all disks matching some undocumented criteria.=0D
=0D
In the block code I've only dealt with node names for block devices, as=0D
IIUC, this is all that libvirt should need in the -blockdev world it now=0D
lives in. IOW, I've made not attempt to cope with people wanting to use=0D
these QMP commands in combination with -drive args, as libvirt will=0D
never use -drive with a QEMU new enough to have these new commands.=0D
=0D
The main limitations of this current impl=0D
=0D
 - The snapshot process runs serialized in the main thread. ie QEMU=0D
   guest execution is blocked for the duration. The job framework=0D
   lets us fix this in future without changing the QMP semantics=0D
   exposed to the apps.=0D
=0D
 - Most vmstate loading errors just go to stderr, as they are not=0D
   using Error **errp reporting. Thus the job framework just=0D
   reports a fairly generic message=0D
=0D
     "Error -22 while loading VM state"=0D
=0D
   Again this can be fixed later without changing the QMP semantics=0D
   exposed to apps.=0D
=0D
I've done some minimal work in libvirt to start to make use of the new=0D
commands to validate their functionality, but this isn't finished yet.=0D
=0D
My ultimate goal is to make the GNOME Boxes maintainer happy again by=0D
having internal snapshots work with OVMF:=0D
=0D

5e=3D=0D
f45c5f64048f16a6e=0D
=0D
Changed in v3:=0D
=0D
 - Schedule a bottom half to escape from coroutine context in=0D
   the jobs. This is needed because the locking in the snapshot=0D
   code goes horribly wrong when run from a background coroutine=0D
   instead of the main event thread.=0D
=0D
 - Re-factor way we iterate over devices, so that we correctly=0D
   report non-existant devices passed by the user over QMP.=0D
=0D
 - Add QAPI docs notes about limitations wrt vmstate error=0D
   reporting (it all goes to stderr not an Error **errp)=0D
   so QMP only gets a fairly generic error message currently.=0D
=0D
 - Add I/O test to validate many usage scenarios / errors=0D
=0D
 - Add I/O test helpers to handle QMP events with a deterministic=0D
   ordering=0D
=0D
 - Ensure 'delete-snapshot' reports an error if requesting=0D
   delete from devices that don't support snapshot, instead of=0D
   silently succeeding with no erro.=0D
=0D
Changed in v2:=0D
=0D
 - Use new command names "snapshot-{load,save,delete}" to make it=0D
   clear that these are different from the "savevm|loadvm|delvm"=0D
   as they use the Job framework=0D
=0D
 - Use an include list for block devs, not an exclude list=0D
