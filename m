That's exactly why I came up with MADV_POPULATE_WRITE, to avoid having 
to mess with different kinds of sigbus at the same time. You can only 
get it wrong.

I assume it's quite broken, for example, already when hotplugging a DIMM 
and prallocating memory for the memory backend.

I don't think it is ok. I assume it has been broken for a long time, 
just nobody ever ran into that race.

It remains broken with old kernels I guess. There isn't too much that we 
can do: disabling prealloc=on once the VM is running breaks existing use 
cases.

Fortunately, running into that race seems to be rare, at least I never 
hear reports.
