Thanks for the analysis!

I understand the issue now.

- "edk2/BaseTools/GNUmakefile" runs $(MAKE) in three subdirs:
  - Source/C,
  - Source/Python,
  - Tests (which depends on the former two)

- "edk2/BaseTools/Source/C/GNUmakefile" builds fine
- "edk2/BaseTools/Source/Python/GNUmakefile" does nothing
- "edk2/BaseTools/Tests/GNUmakefile" depends on PYTHON_COMMAND -- which
  should either come from the user, or from sourcing "edksetup.sh"

Therefore the issue is:

- the "edk2-basetools" target in "roms/Makefile" does not
  run (more precisely, does not "source") edksetup.sh

- the "build-edk2-tools" target in "tests/uefi-test-tools/Makefile"
  does not run (more precisely, does not "source") edksetup.sh

I don't think I will reorganize the dependencies in those makefiles. Nor
will I source edksetup.sh in the makefile recipes. Instead, I'll
directly set PYTHON_COMMAND=3Dpython3 in the "tools" recipes, and in the
build wrapper shell scripts.

I'll try to post v2 soon.

Thanks!
Laszlo
