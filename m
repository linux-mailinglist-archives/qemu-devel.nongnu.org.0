Yes, we'll need ifdefs. Or we could do it like the dmg compression
formats, a spearate source file for zstd that is compiled conditionally.

Anyway, I don't think making zstd a hard dependency for qemu is
acceptable.

Is it available in all relevant distros and even non-Linux platforms
that we support?

Another reason for wanting to compile it out even when it is available
is startup time. Each shared library to be loaded takes some time, and
there are use cases where you want a minimal guest to boot up really
fast.
