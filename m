Ewww I do dislike fake paths, they tend to be the source of great
security bugs.

Yep, openfd is just intended to be sugar; it's a pain to use getfd at
runtime because you have to play all the passing fd's over socket magic.
My main reason here is because I wanted an easy way to migrate to
/dev/null for performance testing, but it would make life easier when
migrating to/from a file.

> Would it instead be worth modifying migration to work with add-fd?

Probably.  At the moment what we have is an 'fd:string' syntax for both
inbound and outbound migration.
The outbound migration looks up the string in the getfd index and uses
it. (via monitor_get_fd)

The inbound migration checks if the string starts with a number, if it
is then it uses it raw as the unix fd; else it passes it to getfd index.
(via monitor_fd_param).
(getfd disallows names that are numeric)

I can see a few solutions here:
  a) Teach qemu a new fdset:number syntax - it's a bit of a pain
     but is discoverable.
  b) Modify the getfd string lookup to parse /dev/fdset and go use
     the fdset

The problem with (b) is that the getfd mechanism doesn't have a
concept of open mode, and only has a single fd bound to a name,
so none of the existing parsing code would know which entry to use in an
fdset. (I'm assuming here no one created a getfd entry named
/dev/fdset/0 - although it seems legal).

The problem with (a) is that adding a new syntax is a bit more code;
but I guess it's probably more discoverable.

ANy preferences?

> add-fd need the same sort of sugar?

Yep, I'd like to have a way to open a file other than via scmrights.
I'd also need to add an HMP equivalent.
