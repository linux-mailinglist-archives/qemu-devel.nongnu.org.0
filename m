Emitting a QMP event when blkdebug injects an error makes sense to me.

I wouldn't use it for this case, though, because this would become racy.
It could happen that the guest writes to the image, which sends a QMP
event, and then reads before the external program has removed the error.

Hm... The SCSI case might get a bit tricky (if the spec does indeed say
that this is what must happen).

blkdebug can only return an I/O error for the whole request. Then the
device would ask for more information about the error and get the sector
number of the error. And then it would have to retry up to immediately
before the problematic sector.

By the way, this is an example where fixing this in the context of
blkdebug will also fix the behaviour for real I/O errors.

Changes that are visible to the guest break live migration, so they are
only allowed with a new option that defaults to off for existing machine
type. The default can change to on for new machine types.

Yes, but I hope it does give you some pointers what to look at. Feel
free to ask more questions once you're ready. (Though I won't be
available next week, but there are other people, too, and I'll read it
later anyway.)
