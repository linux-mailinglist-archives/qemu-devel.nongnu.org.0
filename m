It's followed by everything except for the legacy pc-bios
files that were too painful to clean up.

The problem here really is that there are two possible
failure modes:
 (1) we use a wildcard, and then when we add a new file
     the link isn't added, and incremental builds fail
 (2) we don't use a wildcard, and then when we add a new
     file we have to manually list it, and if we forget
     then builds fail (both incremental and not)

The ideal way to avoid this is to have an entire directory
which contains pregenerated bios blobs and nothing else,
so we can just symlink the whole directory into the build
tree. But pc-bios has this awkward mix of files which
are pre-generated (and thus in git in the source tree)
and files which will get built by make (and which must
live only in the build tree).
