IIRC Samuel Ortiz told he was using GitLab with Aarch64 runners around
Nov 2018, but "compiling from source". Alex Benn=C3=A9e tried building it=
 on
our Packet server during early 2019.
Later an (unattended?) Ubuntu upgrade installed a package that does not
work anymore with current GitLab server. I noticed this few months ago,
built it again and tested it, then looked at what was wrong with the
upstream MR. The Aarch64 packaging succeed when cross-building on x86_64
host, but fails when building natively... Since part of it is "built or
tested in the cloud" and involving Go, I simply let a comment:
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/merge_requests/725#note_18347=
0145

So to confirm what Paolo said, GitLab runners work on Aarch64
(and we have it well tested), however there is a packaging issue,
so it does not work "out of the box".


Related to:

  Runner compiled with Go 1.8.7 seems to not work properly with
  multiarch support. Executing the binary built with Go 1.8.7
  results with an error [...]

There has been 1 recent fix for the go runner:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1838946/comments/1

And there is an ongoing discussion about "patch to swap SIGRTMIN + 1
and SIGRTMAX - 1".
