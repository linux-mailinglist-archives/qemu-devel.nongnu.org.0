That's a good idea. This would allow the user to fine tune their VM to
either allow the original max 248 _or_ enable the diag318 instruction.

Do you think the reduction to 240 max CPUs still makes sense? I do not
know what the future of the RSCPI looks like, but if we end up with more
bytes indicating facility bits, we could simply reduce the the max CPUs
dynamically depending on which features the user / CPU model enables.

In this case, if diag318 is enabled then reduce the max CPUs to 247.
CPU models can protect us WRT migration -- we wouldn't have to concern
ourselves if the destination machine can support the same number of
CPUs.

In the future, if feature X is enabled, then reduce the max CPUs to as
many as we can fit in the remainder of the SCCB.

As per an older discussion, does it still make sense to restrict this
feature starting with a particular CPU model (we decided to allow this
feature starting with the zEC12 model). We have the opportunity to
simply enable this feature for *all* CPU models since this only requires
KVM to support emulation.

Pseudo:

if diag318_cpu_feat_is_enabled
	if kvm_has_diag318
		set facility bit for diag318
	else
		error "KVM does not support emulation of diag318"
		<terminate>

The next question would be this: do we want this feature to be enabled
by default, or only if it is specified by the user?

Default enabled: VMs will have the diag318 capability, but max CPUs will
also be reduced by default. Use will have to explicitly disable diag318
to allow the max 248 CPUs.

User enabled: VMs will have to be configured to enable this capability
(users might not realize / care to add this feature themselves). This is
as simple as providing the CPU model in a guest XML or command line and
providing the diag318feature. The max CPUs will not be altered by
default.
