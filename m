Ok, no problem. I can definitely disable the check on GCC.

Paolo, would you like me to disable checks on AR/linker for lto too?
If so, should I add some of this information on a document, perhaps
docs/devel/lto.rst, so it is written somewhere for future uses?

--

Btw, using lto with gcc I found another interesting warning here
(adding scsi maintainer so they can chip in on the solution):

In function 'scsi_disk_new_request_dump',
     inlined from 'scsi_new_request' at 
../qemu-cfi-v3/hw/scsi/scsi-disk.c:2588:9:
../qemu-cfi-v3/hw/scsi/scsi-disk.c:2562:17: warning: argument 1 value 
'18446744073709551612' exceeds maximum object size 9223372036854775807 
[-Walloc-size-larger-than=]
      line_buffer = g_malloc(len * 5 + 1);
                  ^
../qemu-cfi-v3/hw/scsi/scsi-disk.c: In function 'scsi_new_request':
/usr/include/glib-2.0/glib/gmem.h:78:10: note: in a call to allocation 
function 'g_malloc' declared here
  gpointer g_malloc         (gsize  n_bytes) G_GNUC_MALLOC 
G_GNUC_ALLOC_SIZE(1);

This seems like a bug to me. len is a signed integer filled up by
scsi_cdb_length which can return -1 if it can't decode the command.
What would probably happen is that we try a g_malloc with something too
big and that would fail. However, scsi_disk_new_request_dump is used for
tracing and:

a) I believe an unknown command here is a possibility, and is
handled by the caller - scsi_new_request - that has the following:

     command = buf[0];
     ops = scsi_disk_reqops_dispatch[command];
     if (!ops) {
         ops = &scsi_disk_emulate_reqops;
     }

so a termination here on the malloc is probably not desired.

b) In the tracing, we should probably print the content of the buffer
anyway, so that the unknown command can be debugged. However, I don't
know what size I should use here.
I'm thinking either 1, to print just the command header in the buffer,
or the max size of the buffer, which I am not sure how to get.

Ideas or you prefer having an initial patch and then discuss it there?
