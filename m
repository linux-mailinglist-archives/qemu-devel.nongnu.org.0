The libvirt gitlab issue there is closed as not-a-bug, as the
user had told libvirt <disk type="file" > instead of
<disk type="block">.

The same mistake is present in the XML shown in the debian bug.

Even before the QEMU change, this mistake would cause trouble with
certain areas of libvirt functionality too, especially around
migration and snapshotting.
