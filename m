Whatever solution we use to make sure a new interface is stable,
we must have automated test cases to ensure we don't break it in
the future.  Otherwise we will be creating yet another
compatibility-keeping ritual that we fail to follow because
nobody notices when we break it.

I wouldn't like to move from "2 different object paths that can't
be trusted to be stable" to "3 different object paths that can't
be trusted to be stable".
