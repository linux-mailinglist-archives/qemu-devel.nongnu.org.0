We were actually very conservative in requiring use of SDL 2. We shipped
QEMU with both SDL 1.2 & 2.0 support for many releases, and have only
dropped SDL 1.2 support *5* years after SDL 2.0 was shipped.

No one ever wants to change what they do currently. That's totally
understandable & normal, but that comes with a cost to the project
to maintain compatibility indefinitely. That is not viable for a
project with limited maintainer resources.

There needs to be a balance between adding new technology, and
keeping compatibility with existing technology. QEMU has done
that for a very long time shipping SDL1.2 & SDL2 support in
parallel. More generally our platform support policy and our
feature deprecation policy try to set expectations for consumers
for what to expect in future releases.

That is not the case. Ubuntu has shipped both SDL 1.2 and 2.0
concurrently as options, even in the previous 14.04 LTS, and
probably before that too.

We're not assuming that it is installed, as everyone's OS install
packageset is going to be different. We're just assuming that it is
possible to be installed as an official vendor package, should the
user want that feature. This is not unreasonable IMHO.
