yes. It's worth adding.

The Processor Service Interface (PSI) Controller is a bridge unit which=20
connects the different interfaces to the Power Processor, LPC, FSI, BMC,

Do you really have 3 times the same mapping  ? I think we fix this recent=
ly.

The xive.end memory region contains the ESB pages of the END structure,=20
which has two pairs of PQ bits, for notification and escalation. It
provides a way to coalesce the event notifications at the END level.

No OS makes use of this feature. I agree we could have removed the=20
mapping but we kept it as a reminder.=20

Thanks,
