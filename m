From: Daniel Henrique Barboza <danielhb413@gmail.com>

A new function called spapr_numa_define_associativity_domains()
is created to calculate the associativity domains and change
the associativity arrays considering user input. This is how
the associativity domain between two NUMA nodes A and B is
calculated:

- get the distance D between them

- get the correspondent NUMA level 'n_level' for D. This is done
via a helper called spapr_numa_get_numa_level()

- all associativity arrays were initialized with their own
numa_ids, and we're calculating the distance in node_id ascending
order, starting from node id 0 (the first node retrieved by
numa_state). This will have a cascade effect in the algorithm because
the associativity domains that node 0 defines will be carried over to
other nodes, and node 1 associativities will be carried over after
taking node 0 associativities into account, and so on. This
happens because we'll assign assoc_src as the associativity domain
of dst as well, for all NUMA levels beyond and including n_level.

The PPC kernel expects the associativity domains of the first node
(node id 0) to be always 0 [1], and this algorithm will grant that
by default.

Ultimately, all of this results in a best effort approximation for
the actual NUMA distances the user input in the command line. Given
the nature of how PAPR itself interprets NUMA distances versus the
expectations risen by how ACPI SLIT works, there might be better
algorithms but, in the end, it'll also result in another way to
approximate what the user really wanted.

To keep this commit message no longer than it already is, the next
patch will update the existing documentation in ppc-spapr-numa.rst
with more in depth details and design considerations/drawbacks.
