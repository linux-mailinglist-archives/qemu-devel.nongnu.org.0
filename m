I suppose you=E2=80=99re welcome, but it sounds a bit like overkill for now=

147 specifically wants to test inet, though (among other things).
Support for TLS over Unix sockets won=E2=80=99t change that.  (I suppose it=
 will
reduce the number of inet NBD sockets in other tests, though.)

So we=E2=80=99ll just have to test whether IPv4 works, just like we already=

for IPv6, no?
