We first started adding dropped-in notes at least as early as commit 
912092b (part of v2.10.0), with the 'altgr'/'altgr_r' members of 
QKeyCode.  We did not have qemu-deprecated.texi until commit 44c67847 
(v3.0.0), so the markings originally made sense.

But now that we have a better place for someone to look up "why is my 
QAPI command not working? oh, qemu-deprecated documents that it was 
removed, AND tells me details such as why it was useless or what to use 
in its place", I don't see the need to burden QAPI docs with a mere 
"this old form with no further documentation used to exist, but you 
can't use it now, and furthermore this tidbit of information didn't 
teach you anything useful about what _does_ work with this command" line.

I'm all in favor of stopping the use of 'dropped in' in QAPI source 
files, and sticking to qemu-deprecated.texi instead.
