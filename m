Looking a bit deeper it seems this limit comes from the use of double
precision floating point for storing integers. 2^53-1 is the largest
integer value that can be stored in a 64-bit float without loss of
precision.

The Golang JSON parser decodes JSON numbers to float64 by default so
will have this precision limitation too, though at least they provide
a backdoor for custom parsing from the original serialized representation=

Yep, that's a good point about readability.
