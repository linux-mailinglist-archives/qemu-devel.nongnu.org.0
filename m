AMD does not use dies. For AMD dies is normally set to 1. You probably
have to pass dies in some other ways. Did you try the latest qemu v 5.0?
Please try it.

Qemu expects the user to configure the topology based on their requirement.
 =

Try replacing <qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D3,threads=3D1,dies=3D2,sockets=3D1=
'/> =

with <qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D6,threads=3D1,dies=3D1,sockets=3D1'/>

You can also use the numa configuration. There are multiple ways you can
achieve your required configuration.

Title:
  Cache Layout wrong on many Zen Arch CPUs

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  AMD CPUs have L3 cache per 2, 3 or 4 cores. Currently, TOPOEXT seems
  to always map Cache ass if it was an 4-Core per CCX CPU, which is
  incorrect, and costs upwards 30% performance (more realistically 10%)
  in L3 Cache Layout aware applications.

  Example on a 4-CCX CPU (1950X /w 8 Cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0=C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'8' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  In windows, coreinfo reports correctly:

  ****----  Unified Cache 1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----****  Unified Cache 6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  On a 3-CCX CPU (3960X /w 6 cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'6' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  in windows, coreinfo reports incorrectly:

  ****--  Unified Cache  1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----**  Unified Cache  6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  Validated against 3.0, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 versions of qemu-kvm.

  With newer Qemu there is a fix (that does behave correctly) in using the =
dies parameter:
  =C2=A0<qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D3,threads=3D1,dies=3D2,sockets=3D1'/>

  The problem is that the dies are exposed differently than how AMD does
  it natively, they are exposed to Windows as sockets, which means, that
  if you are nto a business user, you can't ever have a machine with
  more than two CCX (6 cores) as consumer versions of Windows only
  supports two sockets. (Should this be reported as a separate bug?)
