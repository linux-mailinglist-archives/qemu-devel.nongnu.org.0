In
[PATCH v4 2/5] memory: Add IOMMU_ATTR_HW_NESTED_PAGING IOMMU memory
region attribute (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11109701/)

[PATCH v4 3/5] hw/vfio/common: Fail on VFIO/HW nested paging detection
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11109697/)

I proposed to introduce a new IOMMU MR attribute to retrieve whether the
vIOMMU uses HW nested paging to integrate with VFIO. I wonder whether
this kind of solution would fit your need too.

Assuming we would rename the attribute (whose name is challenged by
Peter anyway) into something like IOMMU_ATTR_PHYS_MAP_MODE
taking the possible values: NONE, CM, HW_NESTED_PAGING. SMMUv3 would
return HW_NESTED_PAGING, Intel IOMMU would return CM if CM is enabled or
NONE in the negative. Then we could implement the check directly in VFIO
common.c. That way I don't think you would need the new notifiers and
this would satisfy both requirements?

Thoughts?

Thanks

Eric
