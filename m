Yes.

No.

I just ran random read workload with cache=none.

cache-none              randread-psync          45(MiB/s)       11k             
cache-none-1-thread     randread-psync          63(MiB/s)       15k

With 1 thread it offers more IOPS.

Will try that.

This should be same, isn't it. Changing number of threads serving should
not change number of vmexits?

Never used mpstat. Will try running it and see if I can get something
meaningful.

>  * How does host perf record -a compare?

Will try it. I feel this might be too big and too verbose to get
something meaningful.

No idea. Never tried rust implementation of virtiofsd.

But I suepct it has to do with thread pool implementation and possibly
extra cacheline bouncing.

Thanks
