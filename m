It feels difficult to do in this series because this is a whole new can
of worms.

In patch 35, I actually replace the mirror use case by
is_filtered_child().  So it looks to me as if that should not be done,
because I should instead fix bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter() (and
rename it), because quorum does allow replacing its children by mirror,
even if it does not act as a filter for them.

OTOH, there are other users of bdrv_is_first_non_filter().  Those are
qmp_block_resize() and external_snapshot_prepare(), who throw an error
if that returns false.

I think that=E2=80=99s just wrong.  First of all, I don=E2=80=99t even kn=
ow why we have
that restriction anymore (I can imagine why it used to make sense before
the permission system).  qmp_block_resize() should always work as long
as it can get BLK_PERM_RESIZE; and I don=E2=80=99t know why the parents o=
f some
node would care if you take a snapshot of their child.

I see.  I was thinking about =E2=80=9Cany of COW/RW, of which only one ex=
ists=E2=80=9D.
 There is an assertion for that (that only one filtered child exists at
a time) in the code.  (And I consider assertions part of the contract.)

Well, it=E2=80=99s spelled out through the assertion, but not in the

No.  Some qcow2 nodes match the criteria.  But not all, which makes the
qcow2 driver not a filter driver.

=E2=80=9CWhere in the code=E2=80=9D?  Do you want to add a comment to eve=

While I=E2=80=99m not a fan of comment-less code, I do think that it=E2=80=

to read code.  Which clearly stated this.

Because you apparently wrote this before reading that I agreed to your
renaming proposal, I now feel free to argue that I could just as well
rename .is_filter to .is_rw_filter.

Obviously I won=E2=80=99t because I prefer your proposal.

Why don=E2=80=99t you say so from the start then?

(Sorry, but honestly about 30 % of this discussion to me feels like
you=E2=80=99re playing games with me.  Please don=E2=80=99t take this the=
 wrong way, I
mean it very neutrally.  It=E2=80=99s just that I feel like I=E2=80=99m e=
xplaining
things to you that you very much know, but you just want me to say them.
 And that feels unproductive and sometimes indeed frustrating.)

One thing is that this wouldn=E2=80=99t make the quorum case any easier b=
ecause
it actually doesn=E2=80=99t know for which children it acts as a filter a=
nd for
which it doesn=E2=80=99t.

I don=E2=80=99t quite see how it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cby now=E2=80=9D when =
in your first mail you already
basically wrote that functionally, everything works (leaving out
quorum), but that you=E2=80=99re confused (or claim to be confused, I hav=
e no
idea what=E2=80=99s real and what=E2=80=99s pretended anymore) by the nam=
es.


We have come to two results, as far as I can see:

First, naming COW backing nodes =E2=80=9CCOW filtered children=E2=80=9D c=
lashes with our
existing use of =E2=80=9Dfilter=E2=80=9D.  There is no point in forcing t=
he =E2=80=9Dfilter=E2=80=9D
label on everything.  We can just keep calling (R/W) filters filters and
COW backing children COW children.  The names are succinct enough.

In some cases, we don=E2=80=99t care whether something is a COW or filter=
ed
child, in such a case a caller can be bothered to use the slightly
longer bdrv_cow_or_filtered_child().


Second, most of the time we want a filter node to have a clear and
unique path to go down.  This is the important property of filters: That
you can skip them and go to the node that actually has the data.

Quorum breaks this by having multiple children, and nobody knows which
of them has the data we will see on the next read operation.

All =E2=80=9Cfilters=E2=80=9D who could have multiple children would have=
 this problem.
 Hence a filter must always have a single unique data child.  I think.

An R/W filter always shows the same data as the filtered child.  So the
COW child=E2=80=98s data can never be visible, and as such you couldn=E2=80=
=99t have a
COW child at the same time.
