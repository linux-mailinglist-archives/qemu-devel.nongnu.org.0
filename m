When you send a patch with a Fixes: tag, consider cc'ing people involved
in the commit being fixed.  I might have spotted the regression.

I missed the CLI issue.  I just wanted my directories not littered with

If we keep littering, the annoyance will make me drop the trace backend
"simple" from my build tests.  I might even remember to put it back when
the fix arrives.
