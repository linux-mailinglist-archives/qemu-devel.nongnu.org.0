Libvirt already reports a wide variety of information about a
compute host, that is used for placement decisions by mgmt apps,
and this includes SEV data (obtained from qemu's query-sev-capabilities)

Is that really 'must' be shut down or merely 'should' be shut down.
I'm expecting the latter, as if we're faced with an untrustworthy
compute host, we can't guarantee it will ever be shut dwon.

Nova must always talk with libvirt, never QEMU, because it needs to
be insulated from low level implementation details that change over
time. The QEMU binary we are invoking today, might be completely
replaced with something new tomorrow, with totally different CLI /
APIs, and livirt will isolate apps from this.

Also we need to bear in mind the complexity we're putting on users
and mgmt apps.
