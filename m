I don't think the migration flag (8 bytes) matters, because everyone has
that; but isn't this patch about the 3 bytes (1 byte
ENCONDING_FLAG_XBZRLE) (2 byte encoded_len) ?

The 2 byte encoded_len in this code, corresponds to the 4 byte blen in
qemu_put_compression_data;  I'm not sure but I think that 4 bytes is
included in the length update_compress_thread_counts() sees - if so
that makes it equivalent including the length.
