Hello, Peter, Laurent, Stefan.

I presented in this thread two variants of a potential linux-user-related
project for GSoC/Outreachy. The first variant is more focused on a
particular area (ioctl support), while the second one covers wider set of
current issues within linux-user. The pros and cons of both should be
carefully assesed. I will leave to Peter and Laurent the final judgement if
we want to go or not with this project and also the final formulation of
the project.

Stefan, there was an idea in this thread that this project contributes
(apart to QEMU) to another ooen source project (LTP). In my layman view,
this is an advantage. But, how does that fit into GSoC/Outreachy rules?

Laurent, all this seems to be dependant on whether you are ready to mentor
the project. Are you?

The deadline for submitting GSoC/Outreachy projects (within QEMU) is just
around the corner (Feb 1). I leave to Laurent or Peter (should they give
"go" to this proposal) to officially submit the project on our wiki page
created for that purpose, in the form they deem the best.

Thanks to everyone for expressing the interest in this topic, and
especially coming up with additional ideas!

Truly yours,
Aleksandar
