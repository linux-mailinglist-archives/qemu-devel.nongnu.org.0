I migrated both because at that time I considered we could have
endpoints not attached to any domains but I think I can now simplify
based on the fact any EP is attached.

Even if I only migrate the domain gtree, I need to reconstruct the
ep->domain which was not migrated, on purpose, as it pointed to the old
domain in the origin.

I agree that it is simpler. Also need to update the ep->domain as
mentionned above. Thank you for the suggestion.

As I replied to Jean, I think it makes sense to keep both structures as
endpoints are not indexed by the same key and the bus number is resolved
later.
