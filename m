JSON's 53-bit precision was not part of RFC4627, which was the JSON
specification in 2010.  They say hindsight is 20/20, but referring to
RFC7159 which would come 4 years later is rewriting history, not hindsight.

Many years ago actually I tried replacing QObject with GVariant.  I'm
pretty sure the code for that experiment is lost but it took me just a
couple days so it could be redone.  The only issue was that QObjects are
mutable so some instances of QString had to be replaced with GString.

(A small part of it was merged as commit
9bada8971173345ceb37ed1a47b00a01a4dd48cf for unrelated reasons).

Not really, DBus doesn't provide the extensibility that we get from
optional arguments in commands and optional fields in structs.  Again,
we may discuss the QMP protocol itself, but JSON *was chosen for a reason*.
