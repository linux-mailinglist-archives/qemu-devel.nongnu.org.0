I’ll try again, thanks.

Can you perchance reproduce the bug with a more recent upstream kernel
(e.g. 5.8)?  I seem to recall there have been some locking bugs in the
NFS code, perhaps there was something that was fixed by now.

(Or at least 4.19.150, which seems to be the most recent 4.19.x
according to kernel.org)

I reasoned about that in my previous reply already, see below.  It’s
because just because an image file is read-only when opening it doesn’t
mean that it’s going to stay that way.

You’re correct that in the case of raw, this isn’t about metadata (as
there isn’t any), but about guest data, which needs to be protected from
concurrent access all the same, though.

(As for “why does qemu try to lock, when the option explicitly said
raw”; there is a dedicated option to turn off locking, and that is
file.locking=off.  I’m not suggesting that as a realistic work-around,
I’m just adding that FYI in case you didn’t know and need something ASAP.)
