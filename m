The "comment below" is this one, in qapi/machine.json:

Goes back to commit d4633541ee0, v2.7.0.  @die-id was the first such
interface extension.

A rule like "to use command C, you must pass it whatever you get from
command Q" punches a hole into the "QMP is a stable interface" promise.
Retroactively tacking it onto an existing interface like device-add
some-existing-device is even more problematic than specifying it for a
new interface.  Mind, this is not a categorical "can't ever do that".
It's more like "you better show this is less bad than all the
alternatives we can think of, and we've thought pretty hard".

Since this particular hole failed us the first time anybody actually
tried to wiggle through it, I think Eduardo has a point when he calls
for filling it in by deleting the comment.

By the way, the line preceding the comment

     # @core-id: core number within die the CPU belongs to# @thread-id: thread number within core the CPU belongs to

is actually two lines run together.  Messed up when @die-id was added
(commit 176d2cda0de).  Minor review fail (I didn't look even though I
was cc'ed on v2; I wasn't on v3).  Let's fix that, too.

Makes sense, go ahead.
