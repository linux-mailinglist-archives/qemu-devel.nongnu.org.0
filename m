I'd suggest we don't actually /need/ per-file compiler flags in most
cases. eg when we add  $foo.o-libs += $(FOO_LIBS) that's not really
a per-file setting when it gets expanded onto the final linker line.
Its just a "-lfoo" that gets used for the library as a while.

You can disable warnings selectively per file using a Pragma in the
source.
