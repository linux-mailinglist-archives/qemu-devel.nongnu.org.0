I think I agree with Eduardo on this one. This is generic infrastructure
and we already see that it may require lots of wrapper functions that
call into the same function with different parameters. Checking
dev->realized where necessary can do the same.

I haven't had a closer look at the specific functions, but maybe
they can actually share the same implementation with just some
if (dev->realized) blocks.
