I specifically didn't talk in terms of features, because the problem you
describe is unreasonable to push onto applications.

Rather QEMU could express host baseline

   - "host-v1"  - features A and B
   - "host-v2"  - features A, B and C
   - "host-v3"  - features A, B, C, D, E and f

The mgmt app / admin only has to know which QEMU host baselines their
hosts support.

Essentially this could be viewed as separating the host kernel dependant
bits out of the machine type, into a separate configuration axis.

Daniel
