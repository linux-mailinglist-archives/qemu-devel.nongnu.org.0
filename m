&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Alistair,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the heads up about the upcoming unification =
of RISC-V 32/64 targets.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet I have several concerns and would like to have some=
 brainstorming regarding<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such topics - -<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No worries, I&#39;m happy to discuss.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is, could you elaborate more about the &quot;runti=
me check/switch&quot; which you<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in the previous e-mail :<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-d=
evel/2021-08/msg02154.html" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://li=
sts.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-08/msg02154.html</a><br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not quite following the context.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yep, so something along the lines of this in `riscv_csrrw()`=
<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if (cpu =3D=3D &quot;MyCustomCPU&quot;) {<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0my_custom_csr[csrno].read();<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; }<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So we check if using the CPU then apply extra CSR accesses.<=
br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we don&#39;t have a way to toggle which (vendor) cor=
es, which will be used,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during compile time, it means that we have to build all=
 the vendor code and<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; link them all together; and we might have the chance to=
 encounter collision on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; csrno between different vendors.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see how they will collide as we will only act on=
 1, based on<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the CPU we are using.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; AFAIK, we need to put CSR number into `target/riscv/cpu_bits.h`, =
and they are<br>
&gt; &gt; exposed to the global and let others to use it. With my current d=
esign, which I<br>
&gt; &gt; have sent out by RFC patch series v3, I introduced an abstraction=
 layer,<br>
&gt; &gt; `custom_cpu_bits.h`, which will toggle diffenet set of custom CSR=
 number.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; If we teardown the Kconfig, all symbols will be exposed and then =
it could have<br>
&gt; &gt; a high chance to collide with each other.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I guess this depends on what you are trying to do.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; We could have non public CSRs. So each CPU could have it&#39;s own cus=
tom<br>
&gt; version of `riscv_csr_operations csr_ops[CSR_TABLE_SIZE]` which is in<=
br>
&gt; it&#39;s own C file. We then just add a switch case to CSR accesses an=
d if<br>
&gt; using CPU &quot;customcpu&quot; then we check the `custom_cpu_csr_ops`=
 table.<br>
&gt; NOTE: That we can do something smarter than a switch, but you get the<=
br>
&gt; point. We can implement a read/write function for every element in the=
<br>
&gt; array, with the default just triggering an illegal instruction.<br>
<br>
One thing I would like to discuss here.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I&#39;m not quite sure how the picture of non-public CSR looks lik=
e.<br>
Is it suggested that non-standard CSR number shall not be exposed ?<br>
<br>
I know that we should focus on custom CSR part, yet I need to make sure<br>
that if following logic is permitted to appear in `target/riscv/trans_insn`=
 :<br>
<br>
trans_vendor_A_insn_blah(...) {<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 riscv_csrrw(env, CSR_VENDOR_A_CUSTOM, r, n, write_mask);<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 }<br>
<br>
As far as I know, csr number is not presented as a C++ enum, which we<br>
can access via csr::custom::vendora::foobar, so it&#39;s a globally exposed=
<br>
macro with possiblilty of collision.<br>
<br>
IMHO, the key is that are we permitted to have a uniform interface to acces=
s<br>
CSR, either standard or vendor designed ones, in other parts of QEMU.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; I guess that assumes that each CSR access is self contained. For<br>
&gt; example if changing a custom CSR changes a core part of the<br>
&gt; target/riscv code this won&#39;t really work.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On the other hand I&#39;m not convinced we want vendor changes to affe=
ct<br>
&gt; the core target/riscv code. Ideally all vendor code can be kept in<br>
&gt; it&#39;s own file and it&#39;s fully self contained. That won&#39;t wo=
rk for<br>
&gt; everything, but it should work for enough use cases. We can even have<=
br>
&gt; a custom vendor state that the vendor code can use (it can also change=
<br>
&gt; the CPU state).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
In general, I agree with the point that vendor code should be self-containe=
d.<br>
Yet I have doubts that with the current design of CPU model, are we able to=
<br>
unify the targets and in the meanwhile to keep things tight and neat ?<br>
<br>
The execution flow will be bonded to have a shared instruction decoder/<br>
translator and a shared handler for CSR (i.e. riscv_csrrw). It&#39;s not li=
ke we<br>
get to choose what decoder we want to use or which CSR table we will be<br>
using at xxx_cpu_init(). If we choose to use runtime check/diversion of all=
 of<br>
these parts, the overhead might be tremendous. <br>
<br>
Surely we should be focusing on CSR part for now, and just as you said, CSR=
<br>
is not that perforamnce-centric.<br>
<br>
Yet if we take a look at `configs/targets`, still we&#39;re having 6 MIPS32=
/64<br>
linux-user targets, 4 ARM32/64 linux-user targets and 4 PPC32/64 linux-user=
<br>
targets.<br>
<br>
I guess it will be a very long journey to merge all the variants.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, I&#39;m not quite sure about how we&#39;re go=
ing to merge decode tree files<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; across RV32 and RV64. Vendor-designed custom instructio=
n would have a different<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encoding scheme on bitfields for RV32 and RV64. Current=
ly, we (Andes) are using<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; different decodetree sources for gen32 and gen64 in `ta=
rget/riscv/meson.build`.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, so custom instructions are a whole different problem. I =
think we<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should leave that for now and focus on CSRs.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A quick look though and I suspect we could do a similar CPU =
check in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decode_opc(). Dealing with the decodetree will be problemati=
c though.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m preparing the patch to demonstrate such hiccups=
.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, there&#39;s no control flow logic for=
 decodetree to parse<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decodetree files differently. (e.g. ifdef XLEN =3D=3D 3=
2 then blah, blah).<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To meet in the halfway, maybe after the grand unificati=
on on RV32/64, we can<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still confine vendor custom logic (i.e. instrucions and=
 CSRs) to be toggled by<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whether a certain vendor cpu model is selected ?<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wtih=C2=A0 the d<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I honestly don&#39;t see a scenario where that happens. The =
maintenance<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overhead and confusion of changing the CPUs at build time is=
 too high.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also don&#39;t think we should need that for CSR accesses.=
 Custom<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions are a whole different can of worms.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; IMHO, custom CSR and custom instructions are two sides of a same =
coin in some<br>
&gt; &gt; way. Let me explain it with an example - -<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Andes has a custom instruction called `<a href=3D"http://EXEC.IT"=
 rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">EXEC.IT</a>`, which is a 16-bit long =
com-<br>
&gt; &gt; pressed instruction. By executing such instrcution, an instructio=
n table<br>
&gt; &gt; reside in a particular address specified by a custom CSR called u=
itb will be<br>
&gt; &gt; fetch, decode and execute. By doing so, the code size could be re=
duced.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Hmmm... This is a much more complex use case than I was expecting. I<b=
r>
&gt; have been thinking more about custom CSRs to set a timer or control<br=
>
&gt; the interrupt controller.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Something like what you described is going to be a lot more work.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In your case though I think we can still focus on the CSR aspect<br>
&gt; first. Once that is sorted we can then look at the instruction part.<b=
r>
<br>
Just like the mentioned question above , I&#39;m wondering if we can assume=
<br>
riscv_csrrw() to be a general interface for accessing all the CSRs ?<br>
<br>
Cordially yours,<br>
Ruinland ChuanTzu Tsai<br>
<br>
&gt; The main aim should be that all (or almost all) vendor code lives in<b=
r>
&gt; it&#39;s own file.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Alistair<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The problem is that we have different address encoding on RV32 an=
d RV64.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; And just like you mentioned, in our in-house core, we apply the s=
ame logic on<br>
&gt; &gt; decode_opc() to decode custom instructions first. If such decodin=
g/trans<br>
&gt; &gt; procedure fails, the original decoder will be invoked.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I&#39;m wondering how our friends from T-He=
ad (Guo Ren ?) regard this<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; issue ? AFAIK, they forked QEMU from v3.2.0 and applied=
 their vendor features<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on top of it for quite a while.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not sure.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Sorry for the confusion, I was trying to ping Guo Ren :-D<br>
&gt; &gt; I CC&#39;ed him in the previous e-mail.<br>

gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; During my modification on my previous patch s=
eries for custom CSR support, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe this issue deserves its own discussio=
n (or debate) because it&#39;s _not_<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as simple as &quot;just put those options in =
Kconfig&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The obstables I&#39;ve encountered and the kl=
uges I came up is listed as follow :<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) Due to the design of top-level meson.buil=
d, all Kconfig options will land<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into `*-config-devices.h` since minikconf wil=
l be only used after config_target<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being processed. This will let to the fact th=
at linux-users won&#39;t be able to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use custom CSR code properly becuase they onl=
y includes `*-config-devices.h`.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And that is reasonble due to the fact that ch=
anges on cpu.c and csr.c is a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; target-related matter and linux-user mode sho=
uldn&#39;t include device related<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headers in most of cases.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, modify meson.build to parse target/riscv/=
Kconfig during config_target phase<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is without doubts necessary.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Kconfig option `RISCV_CUSTOM_CSR` is intr=
oduced for RISC-V cpu models to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toggle it at its will. Yet due to the fact th=
at csr.o and cpu.o are linked<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; altogether for all CPU models, the suffer wil=
l be shared without option.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reasonable way to seperate build the=
 fire lane which seperates vendor<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flavored cpu and spec-conformed ones, is to b=
uild them seperately with options<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; toggled diffrently, just like RV32 and RV64 s=
hares almost the same source base,<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yet the sources are compiled with differnt fl=
ags/definitions.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To achieve that, miraculously, we can just pu=
t *.mak files into `target`<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directoy, because that&#39;s how `configure` =
enumerates what targets are supported.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) The longest days are not over yet, if we =
take a good look at how the minikconf<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is invoked during config_devices and in what =
way *.mak presented its options<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inside `default-configs/devices`, we can see =
that *.mak files there is formated<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in `CONFIG_*` style and the minikconf is read=
ing directly during config_device<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; phase. That&#39;s totally different from *.ma=
k files presented in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; `default-configs/targets`. To make the parsin=
g logic consistent, I<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; introduce a rv_custom directory inside which =
contains minikconf-parsable<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mak files.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With this patches, ones can build a A25/AX25 =
linux-user platform by :<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; $ ./configure --target-list=3Driscv64-andes-l=
inux-user,riscv32-andes-linux-user<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey! Thanks for the patches<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not convinced that we want this though.<br=
>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right now we are trying to head towards a riscv64-=
softmmu binary being<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; able to run all RISC-V code. That include 32-bit c=
pus<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (qemu-riscv64-softmmu -cpu r32...) and 64-bit CPUs=
. We shouldn&#39;t be<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; splitting out more targets.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It also goes against the general idea of RISC-V in=
 that everyone has a<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard compliant implementation, they can then a=
dd extra<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; functionality.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of Kconfig options. It doesn&#39;t seem l=
ike a bad idea to have<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an option to fully disable custom CSRs. That way i=
f someone really<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wants performance and doesn&#39;t want custom CSRs=
 they can disable the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switch. Otherwise we leave it on and all custom CS=
Rs are available in<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the build and then controlled by the CPU selection=
 at runtime. If that<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ends up being too difficult to implement though th=
en we don&#39;t have to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have it.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for working on this.<br>
