Hmm=E2=80=A6 so this dates back quite long ago unfortunately, I had basical=
ly
forgotten about this bug report as I=C2=A0had opened it while just
experimenting with qemu.

To the best of my recollection, this was happening with a NixOS, either
16.09, 17.03 or unstable, at an update that was probably within 0-2
months of the time I made the bug report.

Now, I guess the best may be to just close as can't reproduce, as I=C2=A0no
longer have the code originally used to trigger the issue anyway?

Either way, thank you for your feedback!

Title:
  virtfs: mapped-xattr on mount point

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  With
    -virtfs local,path=3D"/tmp",security_model=3Dmapped-xattr,mount_tag=3D"=
shared2"
  in the qemu command line,
    shared2 on /mnt/testbis type 9p (rw,sync,dirsync,relatime,trans=3Dvirti=
o,version=3D9p2000.L,msize=3D262144)
  in the guest mount points, and
    tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)
  in the host mount points (with CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR=3Dy according to zgrep =
/proc/config.gz), running qemu as user "vm-test", trying to "touch a" in /m=
nt/testbis on the VM fails with "Operation not supported". In addition, no =
file or directory actually present in the host's /tmp can be seen in the gu=
est's /mnt/testbis.

  When trying to replace "/tmp" with "/tmp/aaa" on the host, with
  /tmp/aaa owned by root:root, still running qemu as vm-test, trying to
  run "ls" in the guest's /mnt/testbis fails with the weird "ls: reading
  directory '.': Cannot allocate memory", while the directory is empty.

  After a "chown vm-test /tmp/aaa", the guest can list the files
  (despite the permissions already allowing it to do so before), but
  still not write new files: "cannot touch 'b': Operation not
  supported".

  Do you have a pointer as to what is happening?

  PS: complete setup is running all this inside a qemu VM that I use for
  testing, I guess it shouldn't matter but saying it just in case
