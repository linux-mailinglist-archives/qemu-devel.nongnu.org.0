That's basically true for POWER as well - in our case the "memory
encrypt" object (called "host trust limitation" (HTL) object in the
latest version) is basically just a dummy with no parameters.  The
same should work for s390x.

I am considering having the machine always create the HTL object with
a well-known name (e.g. "pef0"), so you can just set the machine
property to it to enable PEF.  Again, that could also be done on
s390x.

Note also that anything could in principle implement the HTL
interface.  So you could have the machine object itelf, or the cpu
implement the interface to avoid creating a dummy object, though that
might get messier that just having a dummy in the long run.

Yes.  However, if either POWER or z ever gets any configurable knobs
for their protection systems, it does provide an obvious place that we
can do that configuration.
