Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
   setting unsupported timeout for i6300esb watchdog causes hw reset

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D778291
  Version: 2.1

  systemd utilizes existing watchdog hardware and set's a 10min timer on re=
boot.
  The i6300esb under qemu doesn't like such a timeout, and immediately rese=
ts the hardware:

  The last message one gets is
  [    9.402243] i6300esb: Unexpected close, not stopping watchdog!

  =

  The linked bug report contains information how this bug can easily be rep=
roduced.
  With any image using a recent enough systemd as PID 1 you should be able =
to reproduce it by running

  qemu-system-x86_64 -curses -enable-kvm -device i6300esb -watchdog-
  action reset -hda <image with systemd>

  =

  I'm uncertain if this is a qemu or kernel/driver bug. If the latter, plea=
se re-assign the bug as necessary.
