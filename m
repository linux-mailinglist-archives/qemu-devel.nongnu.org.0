Let's use an example.

cluster size is 64KB, subcluster size is 2KB, and we get this request:

   write -z 31k 130k

Since pwrite_zeroes_alignment equals the cluster size (64KB), this
would result in 3 calls to qcow2_co_pwrite_zeroes():

   offset=31k  size=33k    [-ENOTSUP, writes actual zeros]
   offset=64k  size=64k    [zeroized using the relevant metadata bits]
   offset=128k size=33k    [-ENOTSUP, writes actual zeros]

However this patch changes the alignment:

    bs->bl.pwrite_zeroes_alignment = s->subcluster_size;

so we get these instead:

   offset=31k  size=1k     [-ENOTSUP, writes actual zeros]
   offset=32k  size=128k   [zeroized using the relevant metadata bits]
   offset=160k size=1k     [-ENOTSUP, writes actual zeros]

So far, so good. Reducing the alignment requirements allows us to
maximize the number of subclusters to zeroize.

Now let's suppose we have this request:

   write -z 32k 128k

This one is aligned so it goes directly to qcow2_co_pwrite_zeroes().
However if the third cluster is compressed then the function will
return -ENOTSUP after having zeroized the first 96KB of the request,
forcing the caller to repeat it completely using the slow path.

I think the problem also exists in the current code (without my
patches). If you zeroize 10 clusters and the last one is compressed
you have to repeat the request after having zeroized 9 clusters.
