I found it using kvm-unit-tests which uses a small initrd to
pass environment variables to the guest. All the tests started
to report FAIL.

Actually I think we need another fix for this error too. We
weren't actually refusing do direct boot the kernel, but we
should have been. We're missing the 'exit(1)' after the error
message.

I agree with the improved commit message if we also add the
'exit(1)', otherwise "refusing to boot" isn't the right thing
to say.
