Yes.

Fine print: QMP accepts (but does not emit) minor extensions[*].  RFC
8592 actually permits this: "A JSON parser MAY accept non-JSON forms or
extensions."  This is due to lazy implementation, not due to an actual
need.  We could deprecate and remove.

To be precise: "An implementation may set limits on the range and
precision of numbers."  Not quite undefined behavior.  Useless all the
same.  There are more interoperability pitfalls due to JSON's
notoriously useless minimal requirements.  Range of numbers is the most
relevant one, because so many implementations set useless numeric
limits, and there is no good way to work around the issue.

Example: qmp_error_response() uses the interpolation extension to safely
insert values into a JSON syntax tree.

    rsp =3D qdict_from_jsonf_nofail("{ 'error': { 'class': %s, 'desc': %s }=
 }",
                                  QapiErrorClass_str(error_get_class(err)),
                                  error_get_pretty(err));

Two extensions, actually:

1. Interpolation: tokens starting with % get replaced by the
   corresponding variable argument converted to a QObject.

2. Single-quoted strings to avoid leaning toothpick syndrome.

Without interpolation, we'd have to construct the tree by hand, like
this:

    error =3D qdict_new();
    qdict_put_str(error, "class", QapiErrorClass_str(error_get_class(err)),
    qdict_put_str(error, "desc", error_get_pretty(err));
    rsp =3D qdict_new();
    qdict_put(rsp, error);

Much harder to read even for such a simple example.

Water under the bridge.
