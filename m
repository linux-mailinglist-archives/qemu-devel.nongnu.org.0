It isn't linking in the native binary sense of the word, but I'd
still consider in "linking" in the more general sense that you're
combining two distinct pieces of work, one of which is a library.

BSD/MIT is more common in the arbitrary snapshot of installed pyton
mods on my system, but there are still a decent number of GPL and
LGPL licensed python modules, and I'd consider the distinction
between GPL and LGPL to still be valid for Python apps.

Ultimately QEMU has been a copyleft licenses project, so I feel
that's a preferrable choice to stick with for the python code,
over the totally permissive licenses.

With regards,
Daniel
