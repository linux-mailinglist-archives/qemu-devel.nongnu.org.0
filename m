Confirmed.  The exact failure mode depends on debugging enabled or not.

The test case is "buggy" in the sense that it makes a call to a NULL
function pointer, and the failure happens while trying to translate
the instructions at address 0.

That said, the correct behaviour for QEMU is a SIGSEGV delivered to
the guest, not an assertion failure.

Title:
  cpu_exec: Assertion !have_mmap_lock() failed

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I have isolated a testcase from the GCC testsuite (actually gfortran,
  test proc_ptr_51.f90) which produces tons of:

  qemu-arm: /home/christophe.lyon/src/qemu/accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c:701:
  cpu_exec: Assertion `!have_mmap_lock()' failed.

  including with master qemu as of today.

  I'm attaching a tarball containing:
  qemu-assert:
  cmd  lib  proc_ptr_51.exe

  qemu-assert/lib:
  ld-linux-armhf.so.3  libc.so.6  libgcc_s.so.1  libgfortran.so.5  libm.so.6

  where cmd is the basic command used to launch the test & reproduce the
  failure.

  Note that the test or the generated may actually be buggy: I have
  reported failures on native aarch64 and arm machines. Yet, qemu should
  not fail with a loop of asserts.
