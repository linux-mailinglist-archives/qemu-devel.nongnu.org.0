Make it more obvious how to add new fields to the version 3 header and
how to interpret them.

The specification is adjusted so for new defined optional fields:

1. Software may support some of these optional fields and ignore the
   others, which means that features may be backported to downstream
   Qemu independently.
3. If @header_length is higher than the highest field end that software
   knows, it should assume that topmost unknown additional fields are
   correct, and keep additional unknown fields as is on rewriting the
   image.
3. If we want to add incompatible field (or a field, for which some its
   values would be incompatible), it must be accompanied by
   incompatible feature bit.

Also the concept of "default is zero" is clarified, as it's strange to
say that the value of the field is assumed to be zero for the software
version which don't know about the field at all and don't know how to
treat it be it zero or not.

 Directly after the image header, optional sections called header extensions can
