With just qemu-system-ppc -M sam460ex the assert seems to happen when the 
guest (board firmware?) writes a value to CFGMSK reg:

(gdb) bt

This is done in the board firmware here:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=u-boot-sam460ex.git;a=blob;f=arch/powerpc/cpu/ppc4xx/4xx_pcie.c;h=13348be93dccc74c13ea043d6635a7f8ece4b5f0;hb=HEAD#l963

when trying to map config space. Here the size is calculated as 0x20000000 
which does not fit the assert. I'm not sure what this means though and 
where is the problem. Any ideas?

BALATON Zoltan
