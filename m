No, that's wrong. If the module exists on disk but is incompatible
with the current QEMU, then we need to be reporting that as an
error to the caller, so they can propagate this problem back up
the stack to the QMP command or CLI arg that started the code path.

We don't need to be using the return status to tell the caller if
the module was loaded or not. We only should be telling thue caller
is there was a reportable error or not.

Consider, there is a call to load block drivers. We don't need
to know whether each block driver was loaded or not. eg if the
'curl' code is a module and we fail to load it, then when code
tries to create a curl based block device the missing curl
support will be reported at that time.  The callers that load
modules should only need to express whether their load attempt
is mandatory or optional, in terms of the module existing on
disk.  If the modules exists on disk, any further errors
encountered when loading it should be propagated.

Nope, this latter doesn't work as it throws away important errors
when loading an incompatible/broken module.

Daniel
