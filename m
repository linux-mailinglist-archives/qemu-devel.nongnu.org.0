Nothing stopping reviewers or contributors from signing up and 
subscribing to labels or issues they care about... It will just be more 
opaque to the ebb and flow of the list.

There are still perhaps things we could do; a bot that generates weekly 
bug report summaries might be a solution.

Click the "bell" icon, choose "custom", and you can subscribe to issues 
project-wide if you'd like. (Reopen, New, Closed, Reassigned).

I started experimenting with using the gitlab issue tracker for my 
Python library project, I'll use it as an example here:

https://gitlab.com/jsnow/qemu/-/labels

You can "subscribe" to labels to be notified about tracker activity in 
just an area of your concern. Here I'm using "Python" and "QMP" labels 
for areas of concern for this topic area.

When an issue gets tagged with one of your subscribed labels, you'll 
receive a notification (I get an email) informing you of the new issue.

(Unfortunately, it looks like issues that are triaged to contain your 
tag after their initial creation only show you the tag change event and 
not the bug text. It might be the case that subscribing to *all* new 
bugs, but then subscribing to labels of concern is the way to go.)

You can reply directly to that email, or any update emails, to update 
the tracker.

Also, you can view your notification settings by going to 
https://gitlab.com/-/profile/notifications

and you can check out your notification settings per-group, per-project, 
etc.

Lastly, you can go to the issue tracker for a project e.g. 
https://gitlab.com/jsnow/qemu/-/issues and at the bottom (If you have 
permission, I assume?) you can click "Email a new issue to this 
project." and receive a special email address for you to use to create 
new issues:

  You can create a new issue inside this project by sending an email to 
the following email address:

The subject will be used as the title of the new issue, and the message 
will be the description. Quick actions and styling with Markdown are 
supported.

This is a private email address generated just for you. Anyone who gets 
ahold of it can create issues or merge requests as if they were you. You 
should reset it if that ever happens.
