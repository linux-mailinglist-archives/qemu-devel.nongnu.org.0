Hi James,
  OK, thanks - some questions:
    a) What version of spice-server have you got on your host?
    b) Does swapping the '-vga qxl' for '-device qxl-vga,max_outputs=3D1' h=
elp? (try with and without the max_outputs=3D1)
    c) Are you able to do bisect builds to try and track down which commit =
broke it?

Title:
  Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.  virt-viewer 8.0.

  Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

  Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using
  integrated ASPEED graphics.

  Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DNyMdcYwOCvY

  Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH3nGG2Mk6i0

  4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.

  Using 4.1.0 with virtio-vga doesn't cause this.
