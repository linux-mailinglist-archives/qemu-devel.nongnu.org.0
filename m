Indeed, that is expected behavior: you have created platform devices
referring to resources that are not available.

That is expected behavior, too: every time the driver core manages to
bind a device to a driver, it will retry all previously deferred probes,
in the hope they can be satisfied by the just bound device.

Note that you can destroy these bogus devices, using e.g.

    # echo gpio-aggregator.0 > \
    /sys/bus/platform/drivers/gpio-aggregator/delete_device

> gpio-aggregator as a loadable module, if that's relevant.

Modular or non-modular shouldn't matter w.r.t. this behavior.
Although unloading the module should get rid of the cruft.

When aggregating GPIO lines, the original GPIO lines are indeed marked
used/reserved, so you cannot use them from userspace.
However, you are expected to use them through the newly created virtual
gpiochip representing the aggregated GPIO lines.

You can try this using the "door" example in
Documentation/admin-guide/gpio/gpio-aggregator.rst, after replacing
gpio2 {19,20} by gpio6 {12,13} to suit your H3ULCB.
