With those two patches applied I can no longer reproduce the problem,
thanks!

For posterity, this is how I've been reproducing the problem:

1. Build a Linux kernel with this patch applied: https://patchwork.kernel.o=
rg/patch/11435077/
2. Run this program under the kernel:

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handler(int signo, siginfo_t *siginfo, void *context) {
  uint32_t *begin =3D (uint32_t *)context;
  uint32_t *end =3D ((uint32_t *)context) + (sizeof(ucontext_t)/4);
  for (uint32_t *i =3D begin; i !=3D end; ++i) {
    printf("%08p %08x\n", i, *i);
  }
  _exit(0);
}

int main() {
  struct sigaction sa;
  sa.sa_sigaction =3D handler;
  sa.sa_flags =3D SA_SIGINFO;
  sigaction(SIGSEGV, &sa, 0);

  return *(int *)((1ULL << 56) + 0x123456);
}

I would expect this program's output to include something like the
following:

0xffffd5869bd0 46415201
0xffffd5869bd4 00000010
0xffffd5869bd8 00123456
0xffffd5869bdc 01000000

But the output that I was seeing with the bad qemu looked like this:

0xffffd5869bd0 46415201
0xffffd5869bd4 00000010
0xffffd5869bd8 00123456
0xffffd5869bdc 00000000

Title:
  ARM: tag bits cleared in FAR_EL1

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  The ARM Architecture Reference Manual provides the following for
  FAR_EL1:

  "For a Data Abort or Watchpoint exception, if address tagging is
  enabled for the address accessed by the data access that caused the
  exception, then this field includes the tag."

  However, I have found that the tag bits in FAR_EL1 are always clear,
  even if the tag bits were set in the original access.

  I can reproduce the problem on both 4.1.1 and master
  (6e8a73e911f066527e775e04b98f31ebd19db600).
