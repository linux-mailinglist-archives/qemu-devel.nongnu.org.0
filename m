Oops, yes, please do.

I tried to drop them because you suggested so, but it results in compile
errors. On closer look, I think qdict.h can go because the typedef will
be present through qemu/osdep.h, which must be included before this one,
but MonitorHMP is only defined by monitor/monitor.h.

IOThread is only defined by system/iothread.h, so I don't think you can
remove this one either.

As long as the result still builds, feel free to drop includes from the
header (and probably add them to source files instead where they will be
missing then).
