If I take off my glasses and step six feet back, I just might be able to
overlook it.

There are compilers that let you switch off array bounds checking.
Would you advocate manual bounds checking to protect people from their
own folly?

I check function preconditions ruthlessly with assert.  There's no sane
way to recover anyway.

Without a way to recover, the only benefit is crashing more prettily.
If the error is six levels deep in a some fancy-pants framework, then
prettier crashes might actually help someone finding the error slightly
faster.  But it ain't.

My final argument is local consistency: use of assertions to check
preconditions is pervasive in scripts/qapi/.
