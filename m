The official DS3231 driver is (hidden) in:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.4-rc6/source/drivers/rtc/rtc-ds1307.c

This driver actually supports around 15 RTC chips, and DS3231 among them.
It contains fairly sophisticated "feature control" that enables it to
support multiple RTC chips.

Your method sounds good to me. Hopefully it won't be too difficult to you
to execute it.
