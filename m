Let's enable the block iotests during "make check" again, to avoid that
they get broken so easily by accident (like we've seen many times in the
past).

v3:
 - Added dependency for "check-block" so that the *-softmmu targets are
   now built first
 - Added 197 and 215 back to gitlab-ci.yml (there is no problem if they
   do not run in parallel with the qtests)
 - Removed 122 from the "auto" group (does not work on ZFS according to
   Alex)
 - Removed 181 and 201 from the "auto" group (they do not work if the
   default machine of QEMU does not support migration)

v2:
 - Added new patch to allow tests without groups, removed the "o_direct"
   group again.
 - Removed some more tests from the "auto" group, like 197 and 215 which
   were sometimes causing the CI pipelines to fail on gitlab
 - Added a patch to remove the "duplicated" tests from the gitlab-ci.yml
   file.

Thomas Huth (4):
  tests/qemu-iotests/check: Allow tests without groups
  tests/qemu-iotests/group: Remove some more tests from the "auto" group
  tests: Run the iotests during "make check" again
  gitlab-ci: Remove qcow2 tests that are handled by "make check" already
