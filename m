I think Pandora's box is already opened, if we can't articulate how
this solution would evolve to support features that we know are coming,
why should we proceed with this approach?  We've already seen interest
in breaking rule (0) in this thread, so we can't focus the solution on
mdev devices.

Maybe the best we can do is to compare one instance of a device to
another instance of a device, without any capability to predict
compatibility prior to creating devices, in the case on mdev.  The
string would need to include not only the device and vendor driver
compatibility, but also anything that has modified the state of the
device, such as creation time or post-creation time configuration.  The
user is left on their own for creating a compatible device, or
filtering devices to determine which might be, or which might generate,
compatible devices.  It's not much of a solution, I wonder if anyone
would even use it.

AFAICT, free-form, vendor defined attributes are useless to libvirt.
Vendors could already put this information in the description attribute
and have it ignored by userspace tools due to the lack of defined
format.  It's also not clear what value this provides when it's
necessarily incomplete, a driver written today cannot know what future
drivers might be compatible with its migration data.  Thanks,

Alex
