Losing "the old way is actually different" makes "The various old ways
to define drives all boil down to the common form" apply to USB.
Misleading.

We could choose to keep information on the old way, like this:

   For USB devices, the old way was actually different:

       -usbdevice disk:format=FMT:FILENAME

   "Was" because "disk:" is gone since v2.12.0.

   The old way provided much less control than -drive's OPTS...  The new
   way fixes that:

       -device usb-storage,drive=DRIVE-ID,removable=RMB

If we prefer not to, then perhaps:

As for block devices, this now reads as if USB was the same as all the
others, which is misleading.

If keep, then perhaps:

   Except for USB it looked like this:

       -usbdevice net:netdev=NET-ID,macaddr=MACADDR,name=ID

   "Looked" because "net:" is gone since v2.12.0.

   QEMU supports assigning host PCI devices (qemu-kvm only at this time)
   and host USB devices.  They can only be assigned with -device.

   PCI:

       -device vfio-pci,host=ADDR,id=ID

   USB:

       -device usb-host,hostbus=BUS,hostaddr=ADDR,vendorid=VID,productid=PRID

   Omitted options match anything.

If keep, add something like

   The old way to assign a USB host device

       -usbdevice host:auto:BUS.ADDR:VID:PRID

   was removed in v2.12.0.  Any of BUS, ADDR, VID, PRID could be the
   wildcard *.

>

Since v2.12.0 was more than two years ago, keeping information on the
old way may be no longer useful.
