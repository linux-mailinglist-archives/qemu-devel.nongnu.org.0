This was raised in my v1 posting:

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-07/msg01346.html

but the conclusion was that it was a non-trivial amount of extra
implementation work

At a high level I consider what I've proposed as being higher level
syntax sugar vs a more generic future impl based on multiple commands
for snapshotting disk & state. I don't think I'd claim that it will
evolve to become the design you're suggesting here, as they are designs
from different levels in the stack. IOW, I think the would ultimately
just exist in parallel. I don't think that's a real problem from a
maint POV, as the large burden from the monolithic snapshot code is
not the HMP/QMP interface, but rather the guts of the internal
impl in the migration/savevm.c and block/snapshot.c files. That code
will exist for as long as the HMP commands exist, and adding a QMP
interface doesn't make that situation worse unless we were intending
to drop the existing HMP commands. If we did change our minds though,
we can just deprecate the QMP command at any time we like.

The issues were described by Kevin here:

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-07/msg02057.html

Assuming the migration impl is actually possible to solve, there is
still the question of actually writing it. That's a non-trivial
amount of work someone has to find time for.

Daniel
