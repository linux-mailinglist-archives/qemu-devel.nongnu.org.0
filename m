Sure! Based on my own experience with the Allwinner H3, I can fully
recommend the steps
described above by Philippe to get the work done. Those are mostly the
things I did as well.

I think the best advice I can give you to get started is, start with the
bare minimum: kernel output.
What I mean by that is, get the linux source and compile it for your target
machine. Next, take the QEMU source and choose
any existing machine that come closest to the machine or SoC that you want
to implement.
Then, just try to get the kernel output working via the serial console by
loading it with -kernel, -append and -dtb arguments.

If you are lucky, serial output already works since the machine is similar
to the one you want to implement. If not,
you may need to check for things like the load address and DRAM addresses
first and try to get output
by reading the kernel dmesg via GDB [1]. If you start QEMU with -s -S
arguments, connect with gdb
and give the 'lx-dmesg' command you'll read the kernel output before it
goes to the serial device.
If you at least selected the right processor and things like the load
address are OK, chances are good
that you at least get some logging.  And then, you have a starting point to
start the real work using the
steps described above by Philippe.

Regards,
Niek

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Hello!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Some months ago I started to work trying to port th=
e Beaglebone<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0support from the old qemu-linaro fork to the new QE=
MU mainstream.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0During my work I found that the Beaglebone have an =
OMAP3 mpu this<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0mpu has very strong relation with the OMAP2 and OMA=
P1 in qemu, they<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0implement a lot of functions in common.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Then I understood that the omap1 and omap2 don&#39;=
t implement things<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0like QOM and needs a lot of work to upgrade it, at =
the same time<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0they are some boards like: omap1_sx, palm, nseries =
that implement<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0this mpus.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Looking the datasheet of the omap1 I realized that =
it&#39;s an very old<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0device and some questions like &quot;make sense wor=
k with this old<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0device?&quot; comes to my mind.<br>
<br>
The OMAP3 reuse various components of the OMAP1/2.<br>
Although in old shape, the OMAP1/2 are in the codebase and work.<br>
It make sense to me to start upgrading the OMAP1/2 to new QOM standard, <br=

then add the OMAP3 missing parts.<br>
<br>
The previous recommendations from Peter are still valid:<br>

<br>
That is:<br>
<br>
- Add tests using old code (booting Linux, network access in guest)<br>
- Add an empty board<br>
- Plug an empty OMAP SoC into the board, add the PoP LPDRAM<br>
- Add a ARM926 core into the SoC<br>
- Add most of the devices as UnimplementedDevice<br>
- Add the interrupt controller in the SoC<br>
- Add the UART in the SoC<br>
- Add the Timers in the SoC<br>
- Try to boot a Linux kernel (UART, TMR, then IRQ tested)<br>
- Add the SD controller in the SoC<br>
- Plug a drive to the SD in the board<br>
- Try to boot u-boot<br>
- You can now start the OMAP2 using a ARM1136 core<br>

<br>

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0a lot of work.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0My motivation is learn more about embedded devices,=
