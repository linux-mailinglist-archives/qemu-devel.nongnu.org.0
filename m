That doesn't surprise me too much; QMP is mostly handled in the main
thread, as are a lot of other things; hanging in COLO has been my
assumption for a while because of that.  However, there's a way to fix
it.

A while ago, Peter Xu added a feature called 'out of band' to QMP; you
can open a QMP connection, set the OOB feature, and then commands that
are marked as OOB are executed off the main thread on  that connection.

At the moment we've just got the one real OOB command, 'migrate-recover'
which is used for recovering postcopy from a similar failure to the COLO
case.

To fix this you'd have to convert colo-lost-heartbeat to be an OOB
command; note it's not that trivial, because you have to make sure the
code that's run as part of the OOB command doesn't take any locks that
could block on something in the main thread; so it can set flags, start
new threads, perhaps call shutdown() on a socket; but it takes some
thinking about.

Not sure of that; cc'ing Maybe thuth knows?
