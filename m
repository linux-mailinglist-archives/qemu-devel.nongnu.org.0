Hi, Ahmed.

The report, and the topic in general, look quite interesting. However, I
would suggest two improvements:

- The title should reflect the content in a clearer way. Let's say,
"Compilers and QEMU performance" would be IMHO better. The expression "two
builds" is just missing the central motivation of the report, which is
comparing gcc-built QEMU and clang-built QEMU, performance-wise.

- At the end, a section "Useful links" would be handy, akin to the similar
section in Report 1. There were many people that analysed (and posted their
results on the internet) gcc vs clang in terms of performance of produced
executables (in contexts other than QEMU). Having the most useful and
informative ones (3-5 links with a short summary for each one would be more
than sufficient) listed in this report would enhance it significantly.

Yours,
Aleksandar
