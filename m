Sure. What I meant is that the warning for "cap-cfpc" should be left alone,
otherwise we get:

$ ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64 -nodefaults -nographic -machine pseries,accel=tcg
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, appending -machine cap-cfpc=workaround
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, cap-sbbc=workaround
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, cap-ibs=workaround

and even weirder:

$ ppc64-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc64 -nodefaults -nographic -machine pseries,accel=tcg -machine cap-cfpc=workaround
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, appending -machine cap-cfpc=workaround
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, cap-sbbc=workaround
qemu-system-ppc64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature, cap-ibs=workaround

Hmm... looking again at error_append_hint(), it shouldn't be passed
&error_fatal or &error_abort. This calls for an extra local_err and
error_propagate() dance... Definitely not in the scope of this patch.

The current warnings from commit 006e9d3618698eeef2f3e07628d22cb6f5c2a039
don't contain hints. We could potentially add one that says "try appending
-machine cap-blah=broken" but it doesn't bring much...

Yes, I agree. Your patch should only be about fixing the message.
I'll have a look at the error_append_hint() story when I'm back
from holidays :)

So, to sum up:
- s/CAPABILITY_ERROR/CAPABILITY_HINT and move "try" there
- drop the unwanted change in the "cap-cfpc" warning

With these fixed:
