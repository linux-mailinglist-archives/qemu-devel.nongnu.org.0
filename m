Makes sense.

I think we should not only set PDC but also try clearing presence bit,
even though the device is actually still there and mapped into guest
memory.
Maybe we should also not send the ABP event at all.

In both cases it's necessary to test with a non-linux guest
(e.g. a couple of versions of windows) to be sure we are not breaking
anything.
