Then you may have not only "the" active layer, but multiple active
layers. I find this a bit counterintuitive.

There is a simple reason why backing-file is an error for a root node:
It doesn't have overlays, so a value to write to the header of overlay
images just doesn't make sense.

The same reasoning doesn't apply for writable images that do have
overlays. Forbidding backing-file is a more arbitrary restriction there.
I'm not saying that we can't make arbitrary restrictions where allowing
an option is not worth the effort, but I feel they should be spelt out
more explicitly instead of twisting words like "active layer" until they
fit the code.

"If 'top' doesn't have an overlay image or is in use by a writer..."?

At least the latter only becomes wrong with this patch, so I think it
needs to be changed by this patch.
