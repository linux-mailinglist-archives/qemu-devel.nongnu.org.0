It does, but, admitedly, we could do a much better job in that area, and we
are certainly not good as a reference platform in that area. Some features
of MIPS SoCs are extremely difficult to implement in QEMU though (for
example, so called hardware miltithreading).

All of the above is far less important than this question: What<br>
