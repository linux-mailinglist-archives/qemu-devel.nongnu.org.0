monitor.c mixes a lot of different things in a single file: The core
monitor infrastructure, HMP infrastrcture, QMP infrastructure, and the
implementation of several HMP and QMP commands. Almost worse, struct
Monitor mixes state for HMP, for QMP, and state actually shared between
all monitors. monitor.c must be linked with a system emulator and even
requires per-target compilation because some of the commands it
implements access system emulator state.

The reason why I care about this is that I'm working on a protoype for a
storage daemon, which wants to use QMP (but probably not HMP) and
obviously doesn't have any system emulator state. So I'm interested in
some core monitor parts that can be linked to non-system-emulator tools.

This series first creates separate structs MonitorQMP and MonitorHMP
which inherit from Monitor, and then moves the associated infrastructure
code into separate source files.

While the split is probably not perfect, I think it's an improvement of
the current state even for QEMU proper, and it's good enough so I can
link my storage daemon against just monitor/core.o and monitor/qmp.o and
get a useless QMP monitor that parses the JSON input and rejects
everything as an unknown command.

Next I'll try to teach it a subset of QMP commands that can actually be
supported in a tool, but while there will be a few follow-up patches to
achieve this, I don't expect that this work will bring up much that
needs to be changed in the splitting process done in this series.

v3:
- Assert monitor_is_qmp() before casting to MonitorQMP in two places
- Added note that HMP doesn't currently use iothread to the
  documentation of MonitorHMP
- Removed unnecessary memset() in monitor_data_init()
- Removed Monitor.cmd_table instead of moving it to MonitorHMP. Renamed
  the tables to have an hmp_ prefix.
- monitor_int.h of v2 becomes monitor-internal.h now
- Cleaned up #include directives in new files
- Moved some more functions between files
- Removed monitor_init() in favour of public monitor_init_hmp/qmp()
- Deprecate -mon control=3Dreadline,pretty=3Don|off
- Improved several commit messages

v2:
- Fix coding style while moving files to make checkpatch happier
- Updated file name references in docs/devel/writing-qmp-commands.txt
- Updated MAINTAINERS for moved and newly created files
- Created monitor/trace-events instead of using the root directory one
- Move {hmp,qmp}.c to monitor/{hmp,qmp}-cmds.c
