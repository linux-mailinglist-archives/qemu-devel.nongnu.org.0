I still find this description very confusing.  The one in the comment
is better, I think, can you maybe copy that one here.

Uh.. you could just return the numa_level from the if-else chain
without going via rounded_distance.  (You could put the rounded
distances in comments on each if clause, if you like).

I'm still not convinced that having the entry at n_level match, but
not those at "coarser"/"more distant" levels be different makes sense.
