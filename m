Everything went well last 10 or so days, Michael and Sarah were responsive,
the code and series got slowly improved more and more, but there was this
disruption by your idea to "take over" the series with implementation of
"real boards", rather than leave Michael doing improvements by himself,
based on our feedback, like in a regular process of review... There are
some pending quite reasonable and simple review items from me, Michael
should continue working on them... But now he is told to wait... Shouldn't
it be some better way?
