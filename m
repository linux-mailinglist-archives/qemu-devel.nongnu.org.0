Laszlo,

The FLASH offsets changing breaking things makes sense.=20

I now realize this is like updating the EFI ROM without rebooting the =
system.  Thus changes in how the new EFI code works is not the issue.=20

Is this migration event visible to the firmware? Traditionally the NVRAM =
is a region in the FD so if you update the FD you have to skip NVRAM =
region or save and restore it. Is that activity happening in this case? =
Even if the ROM layout does not change how do you not lose the contents =
of the NVRAM store when the live migration happens? Sorry if this is a =
remedial question but I'm trying to learn how this migration works.=20

Thanks,

Andrew Fish
