OK. :-)

Argh.  You mean move it from bdrv_set_backing_hd()?  That actually makes
a lot of sense to me.  The problem is that bdrv_replace_child()
currently cannot return an error, which may be a problem for
bdrv_detach_child().  Hm.  But that=E2=80=99s effectively only called fro=
m
functions where the child is unref=E2=80=99d, and you have to know that y=
our own
child is not frozen before you unref it.  So I guess we should be good
to pass an &error_abort there.

But qcow2 is not a filter.  I meant skipping to *file only if the
current node is a filter.  And I don=E2=80=99t mean bs->file, I mean *fil=
e --
like, what bdrv_co_block_status() returns.

You say in your other mail that filters can have an own implementation
of .bdrv_co_block_status(), but I don=E2=80=99t think that makes sense,
actually.  They should always pass the status of their filtered child.

blkdebug is the only filter I know that has an own implementation, and
the only thing besides passing the data through is add an alignment
assertion.  If it simplifies everything else, I=E2=80=99m very much willi=
ng to
break that.
