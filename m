Thanks Michael! I agree and we are covered by the specification. Namely
3.3.1 Driver Requirements: Device Cleanup says "Thus a driver MUST
ensure a virtqueue isn=E2=80=99t live (by device reset) before removing e=
xposed
buffers.". Draining the available buffers from the queue is not wrong --=20
although possibly unnecessary.

So I guess for externally initiated resets (ones not initiated by the
driver) we just have to make sure that the virtio structures are intact
until the virtio device is reset.

Regards,
Halil=20
