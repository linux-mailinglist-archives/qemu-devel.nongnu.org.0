Similar question could be asked for vDPA(kernel) vs VFIO(kernel).

My understanding is for vhost-user may advantages:

- well defined interface, this helps a lot for e.g live migration (cross 
migration among different vendors), backend disconnection, device 
failover and there will be no vendor lock
- high level abstraction, not tie to a specific bus implementation, 
micro VM that want to get rid of PCI can use MMIO transport

So it doesn't conflict with vfio(-user) which is more suitable for any 
vendor specific device (API)s.
