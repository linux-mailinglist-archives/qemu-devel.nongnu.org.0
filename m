Sorry I forgot to including you in patch 0, my bad. Will be sure to
include you in the future.

Thanks for the tip!  We will give record-replay some extra testing to
hopefully shake some things out. :)

Same here, it was hard to reproduce. I did try to use rr on some
shorter runs but no luck there.

We ran it overnight on one of our ARM servers and it eventually
reproduced after about 12 hours in a loop across all the
bios-table-test(s) (no rr).  Never got it to reproduce on an x86
server.  It was fairly consistent too on the same ARM host, it always
reproduced within 8-12 hrs or so, and we were able to reproduce it
several times.

Thanks & Regards,
-Rob
