I thought that having a version number approach is more generic and easy 
to maintain going forward.
If I understand correctly, this is also the approach taken by qxl & qxl-vga.

The more elaborate alternative could have been introducing compat_flags 
(As PVSCSI does) but it seems like it will pollute the property space 
with a lot of useless VMPort properties.
(E.g. x-read-eax-bug, x-no-report-unsupported-cmd, x-no-report-vmx-type 
and etc.).

What is the advantage of having a boolean such as "x-vmport-v2" instead 
of having a single "version" property?
Will it suffice if I would just add documentation above "version" 
property on what is was the functionality in "version==1"?
(Though, it's just easy to scan the vmport.c code for if's involving 
">version"... "version" is more of an internal field for machine-type 
compatibility and not really meant to be used by user)

Which approach do you prefer?

I really wish you would reconsider this. VMX is a really common term in 
VMware terminology.
It is found in binary names, ".vmx" file, ".vmx" file properties, VMware 
Tools prints, open-vm-tools source code and etc.

In contrast, even though I have dealt for many years with VMware 
technologies, I have never known that VMX==vm-executable.
I still think it will introduce much confusion. On the other hard, I 
don't see much confusing with this use of VMX with Intel VT-x
because it is only used inside vmport.c and in vmport properties names. 
And the properties names match the names of the guest
code that interface with vmport in open-vm-tools source code.

If you still have a strong opinion on this, I will change it as you say 
in v3... But please consider above arguments.

I'm not trying to finding explanation on why the comments are irrelevant 
and can be dismissed... It's not my first time contributing code to 
QEMU/KVM...

OK. I will make note of that for next time.
I would have thought maintainers prefer to always have ability to pick 
up the latest version that is ready to avoid reviewing old code that was 
already discussed. Assuming all previous comments were addressed.
