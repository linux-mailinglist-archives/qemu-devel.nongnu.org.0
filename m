I figured I'd provide some logs.

(1) To recap, the aarch64 assembly source code file that seems to be
mis-translated (from the aarch64 binary) lives at

  https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/3604174718e2afc950c3cc64c64ba5165c8692bd/MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLibOptDxe/AArch64/CopyMem.S

The relevant functions are InternalMemCopyMem() and __memcpy().


(2) I disassembled the aarch64 binary with "objdump", and uploaded the
listing to:

  http://people.redhat.com/lersek/aarch64-to-arm-mistranslation/DxeCore.objdump.xz

The InternalMemCopyMem() function starts at hex offset 2b2ec. The
__memcpy() function starts at hex offset 2b180.


(3) I ran the guest with "-d in_asm,op,op_opt,op_ind,out_asm" and
uploaded the log file to:

  http://people.redhat.com/lersek/aarch64-to-arm-mistranslation/tcg.in_asm.op.op_opt.op_ind.out_asm.log.xz

The TBs that correspond to (parts of) the InternalMemCopyMem() and
__memcpy() functions are scattered over the file, but the offset between
the "nice" disassembly from (2), and the in-RAM TBs in (3), can be
determined from the fact that there is a single prfm instruction in the
entire binary. The instruction's offset is 0x2b180 in (2) -- at the
beginning of the __memcpy() function --, and its RAM address is
0x472d2180 in (3). Thus the difference (= the load address of
DxeCore.efi) is 0x472a7000.

(This is logged by the guest as well:

> Loading DXE CORE at 0x000472A7000 EntryPoint=0x000472A8000
)

Thanks
Laszlo
