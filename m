Can you elaborate on your desired setup a bit more? Are you intending to 
use a Linux guest on a Windows host to view gaming streams - or the 
other way around?

Anyway, how is your Bluetooth adapter connected to the host computer? It 
may be possible to pass-through the adapter to the guest OS, allowing it 
to use the adapter using its native drivers.
