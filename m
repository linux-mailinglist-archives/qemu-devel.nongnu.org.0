I tested that patch with my series. If we keep the disable extension code to be executed
before the validation, filtering the extensions that were user enabled only, it fixes
the problem I reported here.

It's worth noticing though that we would be making the intended, conscious decision of
hiding extensions from the isa_string that are actually enabled in the hart. And CPUs
such as SIFIVE_CPU will start working with Z extensions that are beyond their declared
priv spec. This wouldn't be a problem if we could guarantee that userland would always
read 'isa_string' before using an extension, but in reality we can't guarantee that.
Firing an instruction for a given extension and capturing SIGILL to see if the hart supports
it or not isn't forbidden by the ISA.


All this said, I don't mind the proposed solution, as long as we're on the same boat
w.r.t. the design changes and potential userspace impact this might have.


Thanks,


Daniel
