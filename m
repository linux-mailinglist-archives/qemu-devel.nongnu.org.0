What, the 9+30+9 or the 964? :)

Because this script is invoked by meson too.  While my patch to support
a NINJA environment variable was accepted (and we point it to
ninjatool), meson invokes it as "$(NINJA)" --foo with no splitting, so
we need the above change.

But I can do better than this.  I can generate the file directly from
meson.build:

   configure_file(input: files('scripts/ninjatool.py'),
                  output: 'ninjatool',
                  configuration: config_host)

and avoid code duplication between configure and Makefile.

By default, reinvoking meson complains that you probably want to
reconfigure (a la config.status) because there is already a build tree
here.  Our configure script always reconfigures the tree from scratch.
 So I just cause meson to fail that check.

No I'm not.  It should be just $meson, as you do below, though it could
also be $python "$(type -p meson)" if I wanted to override---but
certainly not $python $meson.  It worked for me because I was pointing
$meson to an absolute path under my home directory.

There is actually one reason to override it, which is why I did it in
the patch.  Meson has an automagic way to invoke all Python programs
with the same interpreter that was used to run meson itself (you make
the script non-executable and add "#! /usr/bin/env python3" as the first
line).  If we want to use that feature, we should invoke meson with $python.

FWIW 0.51.0 has now been released so you could grab it from Koji.

I wrote it specifically for QEMU.
