We have different priorities, fair enough.

No change visible on client side. I dropped the async command support
a while ago already, based on your recommendations. I can dig the
archive for the discussion if necessary.

I am just pointing out today drawbacks of turning a function async by
introducing new commands and signals.

When the client disconnects, the background task keeps running, and
there is no simple way to know about that event afaik. My proposal has
a simple API for that (see "qmp: add qmp_return_is_cancelled()"
patch).

They are different things, last we discussed it: jobs are geared
toward block device operations, and do not provide simple qmp-level
facilities that I listed above. What I introduce is a way for an
*existing* QMP command to be splitted, so it can re-enter the main
loop sanely (and not by introducing new commands or signals or making
things unnecessarily more complicated).

My proposal is fairly small:
  27 files changed, 877 insertions(+), 260 deletions(-)

Including test, and the qxl screendump fix, which account for about
1/3 of the series.

It checks for cancellation in a few places, between IO. Full
cancellation would allow to cancel at any time.

It can be pretty bad, think about 4k screens. It is 33177600 bytes,
written in PPM format, blocking the main loop..

QMP operation doing large IO (dumps), or blocking on events, could be
switched to this async form without introducing user-visible change,
and with minimal effort compared to jobs.
