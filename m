The user-visible problem:
$ echo > foo
$ qemu-img map --image-opts driver=3Dfile,filename=3Dfoo,cache.direct=3Do=
n
Offset          Length          Mapped to       File
qemu-img: block/io.c:2093: bdrv_co_block_status: Assertion `*pnum &&
QEMU_IS_ALIGNED(*pnum, align) && align > offset - aligned_offset'
failed.

The internal problem: file-posix truncates status requests to the EOF.
If the EOF is not aligned at the request_alignment,
bdrv_co_block_status() won't like that.

See patch 1 for a deeper discussion (including two possible alternatives
how we could address the problem).
(As I note there, I=E2=80=99ve looked through all block drivers, and I di=
dn=E2=80=99t
find any other which could have the same problem.  gluster uses the same
block-status code, but it doesn=E2=80=99t set a request_alignment.  NBD
force-aligns the server response in nbd_parse_blockstatus_payload().
qcow2... Should be fine as long as no crypto driver has a block limit
exceeding the qcow2 cluster size.  And so on.)

Patch 2 adds a test.  After writing that test, I noticed that we already
had one: 109 fails with -c none before patch 1.  Er, well, at least the
new test is more succinct and has the correct default cache mode, so it
will actually do the test if you run ./check without enforcing any cache
on a filesystem that supports O_DIRECT.
