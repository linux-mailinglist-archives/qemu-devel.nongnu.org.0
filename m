I don't *love* this idea. I think the virt machine is useful, but I'm
not convinced we need a second one.

This feels a little bit more like a "none" machine, as it contains
just the bare minimum to work.

Similar to 1

I'm not fully convinced we need this, but it also doesn't seem to cost
us a lot in terms of maintenance. It would be beneficial if we could
share a bit more of the code. Can we share the socket creation code as
well?

I don't like the name minic though. What about something like
`virt-hpc`, `virt-pcie-minimal` or something like that? That way we
indicate it's still a virt board
