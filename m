Because the intended uses of these fields changed.
As Daniel explained to me initially none of the crypto parameters
were stored in the QCryptoBlockLUKS, and thus there were all passed
as function arguments.
Later when qemu-img info was added/implemented, there was need to 'cache'=
 them
in the header so that info command could use them after image was opened.

Now after my changes this is no longer true. now these crypto parameters =
are set early
on create/load and used everywhere to avoid passing them over and over to=
 each
function.

I haven't had const in mind while writing this but you are right.
Fixed.

Well there are just 8 slots, but yea I don't mind to make this an unsigne=

I swear I documented that in the commit message... yea in the next commit=

True! But at least as you probably noticed I now am aware of that rule, a=

so I have way less such errors now :-)

This is because the purpose of these fields changed. As Daniel explained =
to me
they were initially added after the fact to serve as a cache of into to p=
resent in qemu-img info callback.
But now I use these everywhere in the code so I won't them to be correct =
as soon as possible to minimize
the risk of calling some function that uses these and would read garbage.

Leak is fixed now, thanks!

Leftover, since I added the luks->ivgen_cipher_alg.

The luks->ivgen_cipher_alg is special in the sense that it is not
part of the parsed on-disk header, but rather calculated,
as a workaround for the dm-crypto 'bug'

The long explanation of this is in comment of qcrypto_block_luks_essiv_ci=
pher

I'll remove that local variable, because why not.
