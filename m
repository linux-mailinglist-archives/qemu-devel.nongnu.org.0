I had the same impression when I read sphinx/autodoc
documentation.

I wonder if there are other Python documentation coverage tools
outside Sphinx.  Googling for [python docstring coverage]
resulted in a few different projects, but I don't know which ones
would understand Sphinx-compatible rST docstrings.

Personally, my first priority would be generating reasonable
documentation from docstrings, preferably integrated with the
rest of the QEMU docs.  Gating based on docstring coverage checks
would be just nice to have.
