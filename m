I am in complete agreement with eliminating error propagation within the 
blklogwrites driver. This was never a point of disagreement.

As error propagation is dropped in this patch, the awkwardness referred 
to above will be no more, making that a moot point.

My main issue was that this patch does more than just the mechanical 
transformation required. Changes that are not strictly necessary are 
made, and they slightly change the semantics while duplicating the error 
code and halving the range of the return type (instead of just returning 
*some* value in the absence of a possibility to return nothing, which 
will be thrown away by the caller anyway when an error has occurred).

However, as the consensus seems to be that it is best to change the 
return type to int64_t for consistency with the rest of the codebase, I 
will not object any further regarding that point. Having conceded that, 
this makes the difference between my preferred minimalistic approach and 
this patch insignificant, and it is not my intention to needlessly 
obstruct a perfectly fine patch series.

BTW, I do not think it would be difficult at all to extend the code in 
error.h to make it convenient to extract errno and/or win32 error values 
that have been explicitly provided, but this is a matter best discussed 
separately and left for a later patch.

As for general matters regarding error handling and separation between 
results and errors, I am open to discussing these off-list.

Best regards,
Ari Sundholm
