I have an update on this.  Eric and myself attempted to zero in the
exact cause.  A few things we discovered:

 1) It has nothing to do with having a kernel running
 2) It has to do with having a chardev that is a server socket.  This
    test produces command line arguments such as:

   -chardev socket,id=3Dconsole,path=3D<path>.sock,server,nowait \
   -serial chardev:console

 3) It doesn't seem to have a connection to the test infrastructure code
    (python/qemu/qmp/*), as a I made a number of experiments which
    yielded no differences in behavior.

So, the reproducer given at:

https://github.com/clebergnu/qemu/commit/c778e28c24030c4a36548b714293b319f4=
bf18df

Continues to be be valid (and continues to be limited to arm and aarch64).
Now, after a number of experiments, the following was found to be a 100%
reproducible *workaround*:

https://github.com/clebergnu/qemu/commit/e1713f3b91972ad57c089f276c54db3f3f=
a63423

That basically shutdowns the *console* socket before proceeding with furthe=
r QMP
interaction.  The effectiveness of the workaround can be seen here:

 aarch64 command line:
  - https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/535459499#L3633
 aarch64 QMP interaction:
  - https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/535459499#L3663

 arm command line:
  - https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/535459499#L3747
 arm QMP interaction:
  - https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/535459499#L3767

I hope this provides a few more hints into the real issue.

Title:
  qemu-system-arm and qemu-system-aarch64 QMP hangs after kernel boots

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  After booting a Linux kernel on both arm and aarch64, the QMP sockets get=
s unresponsive. Initially, this was thought to be limited to "quit" command=
s, but it reproduced with others (such as in this
  reproducer).  This is a partial log output:

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0>>> {'execute': 'qmp_capabilities'}
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<<< {'return': {}}

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0>>> {'execute': 'cont'}

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<<< {'return': {}}
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0>>> {'execute': 'stop'}

  Sometimes it takes just the first "stop" command.  Overall, I was able
  to reproduce 100% of times when applied on top of
  6d8e75d41c58892ccc5d4ad61c4da476684c1c83.

  The reproducer test can be seen/fetched at:
  =C2=A0- https://github.com/clebergnu/qemu/commit/c778e28c24030c4a36548b71=
4293b319f4bf18df

  And test results from Travis CI can be seen at:
  =C2=A0- https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/534915669

  For convenience purposes, here's qemu-system-aarch64 launching and hangin=
g on the first "stop":
  =C2=A0- https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/534915669#L3634
  =C2=A0- https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/534915669#L3664

  And here's qemu-system-arm hanging the very same way:
  =C2=A0- https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/534915669#L3799
  =C2=A0- https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/534915669#L3819
