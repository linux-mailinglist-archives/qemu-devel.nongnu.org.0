Thanks for pointing this out!

I stopped asking for re-post since awhile ago.  I don't queue patches in
a public tree but I do review and do keep track of pending patches.

I tend to ask contributors to also ping because sometimes there's a
problem with rebase, I drop the patch but forget to tell the
contributor, and it tends to happen more with big patchsets posted during
freeze as there's a rush to merge changes right after that.
I usually don't bother people with this for small patches though.

I'll try to be clearer in my communication so contributors don't feel
stressed.

Would something like:

"I'll queue it for merge after the release. If possible please ping me
after the release to help make sure it didn't get dropped."

be clearer?

Hopefully windows CI efforts will soon bear fruit to the point where
they stress PCI enough to make maintaining next worth the effort.
