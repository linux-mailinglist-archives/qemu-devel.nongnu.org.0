You're not stating it explicitly, but I guess the thing that you mean
that is actually unsafe is if you have a raw image, always pass
format=3Draw to QEMU (so the guest could write e.g. a qcow2 header), but
then create a backing file without -F, so it will be probed. This is as
bad as specifying format=3Draw only sometimes.

I don't like the idea of responding to this by making raw images more
convenient to use than actual image formats.

How about we approach it the other way around: The troublemaker is raw,
so let's require specifying raw explicitly, and record the probed format
implicitly in other cases. This is a bit weaker in the immediate effect
in that it doesn't protect you when you actually deal with a malicious
image, but in normal use it will point out where your scripts or
management software is too careless. The final result should be that
management tools are fixed and you'll be safe, while manual users who
can usually trust their guests aren't inconvenienced too much.
