multifd migration - there's a single migration "instance", which
has multiple FDs open, each of which has a func registered.

I raised this idea back in the v1 posting. There's a thread starting
at this:

  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg02881.html

which eventually concluded that plain string is best.

I think that's right because the yank feature is providing generic
infrastructure with zero knowledge of backends that are using it.
The only interaction between the yank functionality and its callers
is via an opaque function callback. So there's no conceptual place
at which the yank infra would want to know about the backends nor
pass any backend specific config params to it.

From the POV of the yank code, the "instance" is intentionally opaque.
Whatever the instance wants todo with its callback is acceptable, as
long as it isn't violating the rules for the callback by doing stuff
which can block. In practice right now, an instance is anything which
has a network connection associated with it, but it doesn't have to be
restricted to just networking. Anything which is talking to a service
which can get "stuck" is in scope for supporting yanking.

eg I could imagine an instance having some external helper process and
the yank callback would kill the process

Patch 6 documents that the qio_channel_shutdown method must be
thread safe but perhaps the doc could be more explicit
