I agree. My bad. Thanks for adding this :)

For backwards compatibility I assume=E2=80=A6 Sounds reasonable to me so =
ACK.

Even though I must say I would really like to hear your opinion about =
the thread I had with David Gilbert regarding QEMU=E2=80=99s migration =
backwards compatibility:

Thanks for the assistance pushing this forward,
