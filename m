In general, there's been put quite some effort into the playbooks - sorry I'm
late to the game - is there a plan to introduce QEMU as a project to lcitool?
We've taken care of most of the bits in the playbooks that are being introduced
and for the remaining ones I think it would be that big of an overhaul to do
the adjustments. One major re-factor though would IMO be to break the
dependency lcitool has on the machine naming, kind of restricting it to a
limited set of hosts and corresponding names (e.g. libvirt-fedora-32) which
makes it inconvenient to prepare physical hosts.

Yes, this can be suboptimal...Would it make sense to fall back to build the
binary of a given version from git as a fallback during this playbook if the
necessary arch version isn't provided the official way? Just an idea, I'd like
to avoid the need for you to become the maintainer of the binaries and keep up
with the releases.

Which one of them is considered an automation problem? In lcitool we made
gitlab-runner completely automated on all distros, including FreeBSD:

4) log file permissions - you're creating the user, you can as well create the
file with correct permissions

5) ensure /usr/local/etc/rc.d exists - once you execute build-environment.yml
it will pull a bunch of dependencies which ensure the dir exists

6) gitlab_runner service script should IMO provided by this automation as a
template and install to the correct location

7) ensure the service script is executable - template module can do that

8) register the runner - you're doing that

9) enable the service - Ansible's service module is generic and supports
init/OpenRC

10) I don't see a step 10

IOW I think there should be as little manual intervention as possible and in
this case I don't think any manual steps are needed by the user.

Erik

Why is 403 an acceptable success status code?
