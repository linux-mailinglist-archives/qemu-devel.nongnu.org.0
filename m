I wasn't expecting that to be possible - I'd expect you to be able
to start in a state that looks the same as a primary+failed secondary;
but I'm not sure.

I'm not sure of the answer to this; I've not tried doing it - I'm not
sure anyone has!
But, the colo components do track the state of tcp connections, so I'm
expecting that they have to already exist to have the state of those
connections available for when you start the secondary.

that sounds like it needs investigating.
