My POC had a single lock protecting it's shared state.  I'm kind of
surprised no one jumped on that because it's a big point of lock
contention.  One could argue that the state data and associated lock(s)
should be on each device which leads me to the next point.  I think with
careful locking and sequencing we could address this race condition so
that the error was removed before the write completed.  In fact it would
need to work that way to allow the external test code the ability to
perturb the data before it's written if that's what the test wanted to do.
