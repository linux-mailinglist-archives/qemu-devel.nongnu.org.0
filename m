That might not be that hard to fudge; we already start the VM in
postcopy mode before we have all of RAM; now in that we have to do stuff
to protect the RAM because we expect the guest to access it; in this
case you possibly don't need to.

I don't think I understood why you'd want to map the VMSA, or why it
would be encrypted in such a way it was useful to you.
