Yes, and I still think the same, but "somewhere" includes -d for me. I
just wouldn't want it to be effectively dead code that doesn't have an
effect no matter what options you use.

Even stderr is considered test output. This is not an accident, but we
actually want to test that we get error messages. So this wouldn't
change the visible result.

Maybe what we should do is print a small notice "warnings/errors were
logged" at the end of the line like we do for notrun, so you know you
should rerun the test with -d?

But anyway, why would we ever get error() with a test that passes?

I would be perfectly happy with just a fix that makes the messages
appear again with -d.
