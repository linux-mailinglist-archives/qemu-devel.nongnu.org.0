Sorry for not responding soon enough, too many things.

I wrote patches to address Tom's problem, but couldn't fix all
the cases yet. So far the problem is not Linux but firmwares
announcing pow2 to Linux without checking card layout.

It is hard to make everybody happy, security users and odd firmwares.

I came out with a larger series to be able to classify QEMU API /
devices code as security sensible or not, and use of some unsafe
API to taint some security mode (so far only displaying a warning).
If the security mode is tainted (use of unsafe device, unsafe config,
unsafe feature), then users shouldn't expect safety in the guest.

That way I could have classified the SD card model as unsafe and not
bothered various users by restricting to pow2 card sizes.

The comment is misleading, the restriction was to answer CVE vuln.

Help, reproducible configurations and patches to improve are always
welcomed.
