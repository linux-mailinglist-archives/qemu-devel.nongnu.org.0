Paolo,

what about merging reviewed and acked patches before the soft freeze?

> GDB remote protocol supports reverse debugging of the targets.
> It includes 'reverse step' and 'reverse continue' operations.
> The first one finds the previous step of the execution,
> and the second one is intended to stop at the last breakpoint that
> would happen when the program is executed normally.
>=20
> Reverse debugging is possible in the replay mode, when at least
> one snapshot was created at the record or replay phase.
> QEMU can use these snapshots for travelling back in time with GDB.
>=20
> Running the execution in replay mode allows using GDB reverse debugging
> commands:
>  - reverse-stepi (or rsi): Steps one instruction to the past.
>    QEMU loads on of the prior snapshots and proceeds to the desired
>    instruction forward. When that step is reaches, execution stops.
>  - reverse-continue (or rc): Runs execution "backwards".
>    QEMU tries to find breakpoint or watchpoint by loaded prior snapshot
>    and replaying the execution. Then QEMU loads snapshots again and
>    replays to the latest breakpoint. When there are no breakpoints in
>    the examined section of the execution, QEMU finds one more snapshot
>    and tries again. After the first snapshot is processed, execution
>    stops at this snapshot.
>=20
> The set of patches include the following modifications:
>  - gdbstub update for reverse debugging support
>  - functions that automatically perform reverse step and reverse
>    continue operations
>  - hmp/qmp commands for manipulating the replay process
>  - improvement of the snapshotting for saving the execution step
>    in the snapshot parameters
>  - other record/replay fixes
