Maybe, maybe not.  I'm not making demands.

This is clearer than the text in Vladimir's patch.  It made me
understand why you want to talk about optional.  See, I've been peddling
the introspection kool-aid long enough to take "use introspection to
detect interface changes" for granted.  The idea that anyone would try
something like "if what query-block just gave me doesn't have
dirty-bitmaps in the new location, look for it in the old location" just
didn't come to me.

However, dirty-bitmaps being optional is *not* why you shouldn't do
that!  In fact, doing it is not even wrong.  It only gets wrong when you
do it wrongly.

Wrong: if what query-block just gave me doesn't have dirty-bitmaps in
the new location, only look for it in the old location from now on.

Correct: if what query-block just gave me doesn't have dirty-bitmaps in
the new location, look for it in the old location this time.  Next time,
do the same: try the new location first, then the old location.

Also correct: if what query-block just gave me doesn't have
dirty-bitmaps in the new location, look for it in the old location.
Once I've found it in either location, keep looking for it only there in
the future.  But why would I want to do that?  It's more complicated
than the previous one for no gain.

Correct and preferred: use introspection.  You need to use it anyway to
detect changes in arguments, so why do something else for changes in
results.  Have some kool-aid!

No, I'm giving you a friendly "use your judgement" instead.  You may
well be a better judge of what our users need here, because you're less
deep into introspection than me, and so are our users.
