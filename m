While I was working on [1] I needed to check what dependencies
were missing on Travis environment to build a kernel. The test was
coded so that a build failure would cancel the test. As a result,
and because all tests pass'ed (or cancel'ed) I could not see
the Avocado logs (consequentely not able to check the missing
packages). That was the main reason for the Patch 01 in this
series. Also it seems pointless to print the log of the tests
that pass.

The patch 02 is a tentative to improve the browsing of build vs
test logs. Honestly I was expecting that Travis was able to
put the output of steps each on toggled text boxes (see the
'before_script' section, each command output has a
toggle). But that isn't the behavior of the 'script'
section. At least it prints the end of the build command
('The command "BUILD_RC=3D0 && make -j3 || BUILD_RC=3D$?" exited with 0.')
which can be grep'ed.
