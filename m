Matt Fitzpatrick's post ("[RFC,v1] Namespace Management Support") pushed
me to finally get my head out of my a** and post this series.

This is basically a follow-up to my previous series ("nvme: v1.3, sgls,
metadata and new 'ocssd' device"), but I'm not tagging it as a v2
because the patches for metadata and the ocssd device have been dropped.
Instead, this series also includes a patch that enables support for
multiple namespaces in a "proper" way by adding a new 'nvme-ns' device
model such that the "real" nvme device is composed of the 'nvme' device
model (the core controller) and multiple 'nvme-ns' devices that model
the namespaces.

All in all, the patches in this series should be less controversial, but
I know there is a lot to go through. I've kept commit 011de3d531b6
("nvme: refactor device realization") as a single commit, but I can chop
it up if any reviwers would prefer that, but the series is already at 16
patches. The refactor patch is basically just code movement.

At a glance, this series:

  - generally fixes up the device to be as close to NVMe 1.3d compliant a=
s
    possible (in terms of 'mandatory' features) by:
      - adding proper setting of the SUBNQN and VER fields
      - supporting the Abort command
      - supporting the Asynchronous Event Request command
      - supporting the Get Log Page command
      - providing reasonable stub responses to Get/Set Feature command of
        mandatory features
  - adds support for scatter gather lists (SGLs)
  - simplifies DMA/CMB mappings and support PRPs/SGLs in the CMB
  - adds support for multiple block requests per nvme request (this is
    useful for future support for metadata, OCSSD 2.0 vector requests
    and upcoming zoned namespaces)
  - adds support for multiple namespaces


Thanks to everyone who chipped in on the discussion on multiple
namespaces! You're CC'ed ;)
