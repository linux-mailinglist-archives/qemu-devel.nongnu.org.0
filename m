That's still not an apples/apples comparison though. The containers have
many mre packages installed and so test more features. Add all those extra
packages into the original apt-get/dnf commands and then compare times.

I do agree though that I don't much like the 3 containers stages. I set
them up so they would parallelize. ie stage 2 can start without waiting
for entire of stage 1 to finish - only the parent container needs to
finish. The builds stage still waits for all the containers to complete.

We could do similar optimize for the actual build jobs, so they don't have
to wait for all containers to finish - they only need wait for their own
required container to finish.

Ultimately it might be a better tradeoff to not have inheritance between
the containers, and instead just duplicate the common packages in each.
This leads to bigger container images, but simpler builds. Libvirt went
this way for its cross compiler images, just duplicating the shared parts
in each.

Daniel
