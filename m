Well, the "should" and "might" are covering different things.
Existing working command lines should continue to work.  But those
command lines must already have the necessary tweaks to make virtio
work properly.  If you try to make a new command line for a PV guest
with a virtio device - or anything else that introduces extra PV
complications - then just chosing a CPU model with UNPACK might not be
enough.  By contrast, if you set host-trust-limitation, then it should
work and be PV capable with an arbitrary set of devices, or else fail
immediately with a meaningful error.
