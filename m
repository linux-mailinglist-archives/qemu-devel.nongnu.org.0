yep, you can use it to iterate over hotplugged CPUs.
hw side (QEMU) uses cpu_hotplug_ops as IO write/read handlers
and firmware side (ACPI) scannig for hotplugged CPUs is implemented
in CPU_SCAN_METHOD.

What we can do on QEMU side is to write agreed upon value to command port (0xB2)
from CPU_SCAN_METHOD after taking ctrl_lock but before starting scan loop.
That way firmware will first bring up (from fw pov) all hotplugged CPUs
and then return control to OS to do the same from OS pov.

SeaBIOS writes 0x00 into command port, but it seems that's taken by
EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL. So we can use the next unused value
(lets say 0x4). We probably don't have to use status port or 
EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL, since the value of written into 0xB2
is sufficient to distinguish hotplug event.

Potentially we can can avoid writing custom SMI handler,
what do you think about following workflow:

on system boot after initial CPUs relocation, firmware set NOP SMI handler
at default SMBASE.
Then as reaction to GPE triggered SMI (on cpu hotplug), after SMI rendezvous,
a host cpu reads IO port 0xB2 and does hotplugged CPUs enumeration.

  a) assuming we allow hotplug only in case of negotiated SMI broadcast
     host CPU shoots down all in-flight INIT/SIPI/SIPI for hotpugged CPUs
     to avoid race within relocation handler.

 After that host CPU in loop

  b) it prepares/initializes necessary CPU structures for a hotplugged
     CPU if necessary and replaces NOP SMI handler with the relocation
     SMI handler that is used during system boot.
     
  c) a host CPU sends NOP INIT/SIPI/SIPI to the hotplugged CPU

  d) the woken up hotplugged CPU, jumps to default SMBASE and
     executes hotplug relocation handler.

  e) after the hotplugged CPU  is relocated and if there are more
     hotplugged CPUs, a host CPU repeats b-d steps for the next
     hotplugged CPU.

  f) after all CPUs are relocated, restore NOP SMI handler at default
     SMBASE.
