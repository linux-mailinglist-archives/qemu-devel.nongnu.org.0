I wouldn't agree with that. By being pretty, it also is functionally
more useful (I can tell at a glance whether somebody is sending a patch
from another author).

Sure, for your list that munges From headers, always including an
in-body From is way better. But for those of us _not_ on such lists, I'd
much prefer not to force the in-body version on them.
