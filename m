Ok, so basically instead of blocking user.virtiofs.trusted. from client,
prefix it with "user.virtiofs." one more time. IOW, allow client to
set user.virtiofs.trusted. because it will get back user.virtiofs.trusted.
and not "trusted." which is ok. Now client user space can't fool client
kernel with setting arbitrary user.virtiofs.trusted xattrs.

And if client kernel sends, trusted., it will get back trusted.

Only thing which can happen is that client1 sets user.virtiofs.trusted.
and nested client2 will get it as trusted. So client1 user space can
fool nested client's kernel. But given client1 has launched nested
client2, we should be able to trust some user on client1 and make
sure other users can't see this shared dir and this probably is
not an issue.

user.virtiofs.trusted on server will be converted to trusted., right?
Can't block it otherwise L1 client breaks, isn't it?
