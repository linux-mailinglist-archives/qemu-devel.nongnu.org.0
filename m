Yeh, there's an outstanding request to validate other CPU flags as well.

Sounds reasonable.
Note there are a couple of other considerations when choosing the
physbits as reported to the guest:

  a) TCG's view - I think it had a fixed size of 40 bits, but I haven't
     dug into it.
  b) We recently gained 'host-phys-bits-limit' which when used with
host-phys-bits lets you take the host value but then limit it.  Eduardo
seems to have done that to limit the guest from flipping into 5-level
page tables.  Hmm I've not tried with chips that do 5-level - but maybe
we also need this if you expect to migrate to hosts that don't have it.

(I've also got a vague memory that there's a limit in some IOMMUs
address sizes, but I can't remember what the details were).
