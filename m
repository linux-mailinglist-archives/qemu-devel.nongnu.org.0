Rule of thumb -- patches should generally be 200 lines
or less (less is good!), with exceptions where something
is very mechanical/repetitive and there's no point
splitting it up (eg there's no need to have the new
syscall_nr.h additions split into multiple patches).
Judging purely by the "2184 insertions" summary you
should probably be looking to split this into somewhere
between 5 and 10 patches, where each patch is a coherent
chunk with a commit message describing it.

Typically a new port is a complete patchset consisting
of multiple patches which are intended to be applied in
sequence. (They should be sent to the mailing list so
they appear as a cover letter plus a set of patch
emails each of which is a follow-up/reply to the cover
letter. git-send-email can do this kind of thing for you.)

The requirement for a patch series like that is that
at each intermediate point QEMU should still build
and pass 'make check'; but the new port will obviously
not be completely functional until all the parts are
present. You can probably look at how the initial
commits for various other recent ports were structured
to see the general idea.
