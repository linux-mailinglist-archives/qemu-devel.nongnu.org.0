> +This chapter explains the security requirements that QEMU is designed to
> meet
> +and principles for securely deploying QEMU.
> +
> +@section Security Requirements
> +
> +QEMU supports many different use cases, some of which have stricter
> security
> +requirements than others.  The community has agreed on the overall
> security
> +requirements that users may depend on.  These requirements define what i=
s
> +considered supported from a security perspective.
> +
> +@subsection Virtualization Use Case
> +
> +The virtualization use case covers cloud and virtual private server (VPS=
)
> +hosting, as well as traditional data center and desktop virtualization.
> These
> +use cases rely on hardware virtualization extensions to execute guest co=
de
> +safely on the physical CPU at close-to-native speed.
> +
> +The following entities are untrusted, meaning that they may be buggy or
> +malicious:
> +
> +@itemize
> +@item Guest
> +@item User-facing interfaces (e.g. VNC, SPICE, WebSocket)
> +@item Network protocols (e.g. NBD, live migration)
> +@item User-supplied files (e.g. disk images, kernels, device trees)
> +@item Passthrough devices (e.g. PCI, USB)
> +@end itemize
> +
> +Bugs affecting these entities are evaluated on whether they can cause
> damage in
> +real-world use cases and treated as security bugs if this is the case.
> +
> +@subsection Non-virtualization Use Case
> +
> +The non-virtualization use case covers emulation using the Tiny Code
> Generator
> +(TCG).  In principle the TCG and device emulation code used in
> conjunction with
> +the non-virtualization use case should meet the same security
> requirements as
> +the virtualization use case.  However, for historical reasons much of th=
e
> +non-virtualization use case code was not written with these security
> +requirements in mind.

> +@subsection Guest Isolation
> +
> +Guest isolation is the confinement of guest code to the virtual machine.
> When
> +guest code gains control of execution on the host this is called escapin=
g

> +virtual machine.  Isolation also includes resource limits such as
> throttling of

> +limits.

> +QEMU presents an attack surface to the guest in the form of emulated
> devices.
> +The guest must not be able to gain control of QEMU.  Bugs in emulated
> devices
> +could allow malicious guests to gain code execution in QEMU.  At this

> +@subsection Principle of Least Privilege
> +
> +The principle of least privilege states that each component only has
> access to
> +the privileges necessary for its function.  In the case of QEMU this
> means that
> +each process only has access to resources belonging to the guest.
> +
> +The QEMU process should not have access to any resources that are
> inaccessible
> +to the guest.  This way the guest does not gain anything by escaping int=
o
> the
> +QEMU process since it already has access to those same resources from
> within
> +the guest.
> +
> +Following the principle of least privilege immediately fulfills guest
> isolation
> +requirements.  For example, guest A only has access to its own disk imag=
e
> file
> +@code{a.img} and not guest B's disk image file @code{b.img}.
> +
> +In reality certain resources are inaccessible to the guest but must be
> +available to QEMU to perform its function.  For example, host system
> calls are
> +necessary for QEMU but are not exposed to guests.  A guest that escapes
> into
> +the QEMU process can then begin invoking host system calls.
> +
> +New features must be designed to follow the principle of least privilege=
.
> +Should this not be possible for technical reasons, the security risk mus=
t
> be
> +clearly documented so users are aware of the trade-off of enabling the
> feature.
> +
> +@subsection Isolation mechanisms
> +
> +Several isolation mechanisms are available to realize this architecture =
of
> +guest isolation and the principle of least privilege.  With the exceptio=
n
> of
> +Linux seccomp, these mechanisms are all deployed by management tools tha=
t
> +launch QEMU, such as libvirt.  They are also platform-specific so they
> are only
> +described briefly for Linux here.
> +
> +The fundamental isolation mechanism is that QEMU processes must run as
> +unprivileged users.  Sometimes it seems more convenient to launch QEMU a=
s
> +root to give it access to host devices (e.g. @code{/dev/net/tun}) but
> this poses a
> +huge security risk.  File descriptor passing can be used to give an
> otherwise
> +unprivileged QEMU process access to host devices without running QEMU as
> root.
> +It is also possible to launch QEMU as a non-root user and configure UNIX
> groups
> +for access to @code{/dev/kvm}, @code{/dev/net/tun}, and other device
> nodes.
> +Some Linux distros already ship with UNIX groups for these devices by
> default.
> +
> +@itemize
> +@item SELinux and AppArmor make it possible to confine processes beyond
> the
> +traditional UNIX process and file permissions model.  They restrict the
> QEMU
> +process from accessing processes and files on the host system that are n=
ot
> +needed by QEMU.
> +
> +@item Resource limits and cgroup controllers provide throughput and
> utilization
> +limits on key resources such as CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth.
> +
> +@item Linux namespaces can be used to make process, file system, and
> other system
> +resources unavailable to QEMU.  A namespaced QEMU process is restricted
> to only
> +those resources that were granted to it.
> +
> +@item Linux seccomp is available via the QEMU @option{--sandbox} option.
