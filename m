The single backtick in ReST is the "default role". Currently, Sphinx's
default role is called "content". Sphinx suggests you can use the "Any"
role instead to turn any single-backtick enclosed item into a
cross-reference.

Before we do that, though, we'll need to turn all existing usages of the
"content" role to inline verbatim markup by using double backticks
instead.
