well,
one has to wonder why previous patches looked strange before they stumble
on this one. So it's awkward fro reviewer and I'd guess for whomever would
dig through the history later.

the other interfaces (qmp/monitor/-device) are using verbose form only,
so it would be better to just be consistent with them.

We can't do the same for already existing cpus since it might break existing
configurations out-there. But at least the new code won't get in the way
when we get to deprecating multiple ways one could name cpu with -cpu.
