With Cheetah (I wonder where that name comes from?), yes, same for
N8x0. SX1 I don't have, but the SoC is the same as on Palm TE.

Please don't delete OMAP boards quite yet :) In the mainline kernel
they are not orphaned, they frequently get tested using actual hardware,
and QEMU would help in additional testing. I'll try to get N8x0 boot to
work with the minimal kernel I use on real HW.

Regarding N8x0 and bluetooth (mentioned in one of the linked threads), I
guess the removal of the bluetooth subsystem can be done without removing
the whole machine: just don't pass the OMAP BT TAG to the kernel anymore,
and it should ignore the BT hardware (just an idea based on quick read
of vendor kernel sources, the mainline kernel does not support BT on
this board).
