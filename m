I can easily crash QEMU as long as KVM is used with e1000 and reboot
many times, then I hit this and QEMU aborts [1]:

  kvm_mem_ioeventfd_add: error adding ioeventfd: No space left on device (28)

To reproduce this issue and also to avoid rebooting so many times,
simply dump the devcount from KVM would work too with this patch
applied to kernel:

Just watch it increase with reboots...

After some digging, it seems to be the coalesced mmio device that
overflowed the kvm io device count.

I suspect it's not working from the very beginning when the coalesced
interfaces were introduced...  We had a fix for the addition
previously but it seems that the deletion part was still broken.  This
patchset tries to fix the two problems related to the deletion part.

IMHO the 2nd patch is a workaround of KVM in that KVM should allow
KVM_UNREGISTER_COALESCED_MMIO to work even if the user specified a
very large zone that covers multiple mmio devices.  I've a KVM patch
for that, however I didn't send it because it'll slightly change the
syscall behavior (of course it won't break any existing users in most
cases).  Please shoot if anyone thought I should post that for good.

I _think_ this should be needed by stables as well because e1000 is
still widely used (is it?) and triggering it is still not that hard
(simply reboot enough times, this should be even worse if we got more
MMIO devices, e.g., multiple e1000-like devices). I'll leave
maintainers to judge.

Please have a look, thanks.
