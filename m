To make sure
Do you mean you need a environment for testing?

How about Hisilicon kunpeng920, arm64 platform supporting SVA in host now.
There is such a platform in linaro mlab that I think we can share.
Currently I am testing with uacce,
By testing a user driver (hisi zip accelerator) in guest, we can test 
vSVA and PASID easily.

Thanks
