For s390, there's the 'unpack' cpu facility bit, which is indicated iff
the kernel indicates availability of the feature (depending on hardware
support). If that cpu facility is available, a guest can choose to
transition into protected mode. The current state (protected mode or
not) is tracked in the s390 ccw machine.

If I understand the series here correctly (I only did a quick
read-through), the user has to instruct QEMU to make protection
available, via a new machine property that links to an object?
