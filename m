Sorry, I need to correct my terminology here (no change to my
description of the behavior, just the terms) -- basically SIGCONT
resumes the target process (if stopped) as soon as it is generated (=
made pending) for the target process; the disposition and/or masking of
SIGCONT in the target has no effect on this.

If a handler and/or masking are used in the target process, those only
affect delivery; and in that case, delivery of SIGCONT is no different
from that of other signals.

In the end, SIGCONT first resumes the process (if stopped), regardless
of disposition / masking, and *then* it is delivered, subject to
disposition and masking. (If SIGCONT is not blocked but it is caught,
then of course generation and delivery are indistinguishable in the
target process.)

(A program I had written earlier relied on this specifically, for
restarting a timer -- it would block SIGCONT at all times, except in a
very tight "event fetch" call, such as pselect(). So there could easily
be sections of code that would run with SIGCONT actively pending. In
fact, async SIGCONT could be used to force a timer restart, without ever
sending SIGSTOP!)

So the short paragraph I'm quoting right above is inaccurate because, if
no handler is installed, SIGCONT is not "delivered" at all.

Thanks
