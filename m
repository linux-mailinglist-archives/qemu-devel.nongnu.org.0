I'm still getting along with Coccinelle. I'm able to do simple matches but
couldn't make it work to match this scenario. I didn't invest too much
time on it though.

I used pcregrep:

$ pcregrep --exclude-dir=build --exclude-dir=docs --exclude-dir=scripts -r -n -M ':\n*\s*return' . > clean_labels

(note: there was a lot more of --exclude-dir in the original command, unfortunately I
didn't record it)

Then I filtered in the output file the cases where the regexp matched "switch"
labels and any other false positives like strings in comments. It's not manual
inspection, but it was crude indeed.

I am not aware of how QEMU handles Coccinelle, if it is imposed via
./scripts/checkpatch.pl or something that it is ran from time to time to
suggest changes. But if it's desirable, I can see if I can cook a Coccinelle
script (or anything a bit more sophisticated than what I did)  to flag these
cases I attempted to handle with this series.


Thanks,
