Just to clarify, I won't thoroughly test it. My main concern is that it
doesn't break things. I usually rely on this:

The synth backend allows to simulate anything you want, provided you
code it of course :)

It is currently used to run some 9p protocol conformance tests. Have a
look at the backend code to get the idea.

hw/9pfs/9p-synth.h
hw/9pfs/9p-synth.c

and the test program:

tests/virtio-9p-test.c

It currently doesn't care for st_dev/st_ino at all, but I guess
it shouldn't be that hard to add the necessary bits.
