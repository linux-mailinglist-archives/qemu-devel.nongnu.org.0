... object_property_set_bool() can fail only when

* No property with that name exists (programming error)

* The property is read-only (programming error)

* Its ->set() method fails

  The method is actually set_bool(), which fails only when

  - the device is already realized (programming errro)
  - visit_type_bool() fails (programming error)

Now, you may prefer not to know all that here, and instead propagate the
error.  I have two issues with that: it clutters the code, and the
impossible error path is untestable.

The common way to limit the clutter is of course skipping the cleanup ;)

You could also aim for the sour spot where the impossible error path is
wrong.  Extra points for making it subtly wrong, and tempting to copy to
a place where it's actually possible.

Bah, I'll take &error_abort, thank you very much.

quanta_gsj_init() states "realizing this device can't fail".

The realize method states "this step can't fail" for a number of steps.

What's wrong with that?

That would be my advice.

In general, yes.  For a specific device, you may know it can't fail, and
then &error_abort may be okay.

Basically yes.

A machine init may also choose to recover from an error.  Say create an
optional device, and if it doesn't work, just omit it.  Just an example
for illustration; it feels like a bad idea to me.

Yes.

Many, many devices neglect to clean up properly on error, and get away
with it only because all callers treat errors as fatal.

If you decide to take cleanup shortcuts, say because the cleanup is
untestable, consider adding a comment at least.

Looks like a bug fix to me :)
