Standard comment for patches adding HMP-only monitor commands:

In general, functionality available in HMP should also available in QMP.
Exceptions include functionality that makes no sense in QMP, or is of
use only for human users.  If you think your command is an exception,
please explain why in the commit message.

If it isn't, you need to implement it for QMP (including suitable test
cases), then rewrite the HMP version to reuse either the QMP command or
a common core.

Example for "makes no sense in QMP": setting the current CPU, because a
QMP monitor doesn't have a current CPU.

Examples for "is of use only for human users": HMP command "help", the
integrated pocket calculator.
