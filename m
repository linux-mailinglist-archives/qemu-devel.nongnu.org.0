Thanks Dave for sharing your thoughts.

We hope to do a fair comparison of compression rate and xbzrle encoding 
rate.
The current compression_rate doesn't include the migration flag overhead 
(please see
update_compress thread_counts() ). So for xbzrle encoding rate, we 
wanted it not include the migration
protocol flags as well (but the 2 bytes xbzrle encoding overhead is kept 
there, as the compression rate
includes the compression header overhead).

Or would you think it is necessary to add the migration flag (8 bytes) 
for compression
when calculating the compression rate?

Best,
Wei
