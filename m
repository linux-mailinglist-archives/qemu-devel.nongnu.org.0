Three coarser cases:

* systemd_supports_mode() returned false with @local_err set
* systemd_supports_mode() returned false with @local_err clear
* systemd_supports_mode() returned true with @local_err clear

GLib specificially advises against the second case with GError:

    By convention, if you return a boolean value indicating success then
    TRUE means success and FALSE means failure.  Avoid creating
    functions which have a boolean return value and a GError parameter,
    but where the boolean does something other than signal whether the
    GError is set.

    https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Error-Reporting.html

In my opinion, the advice applies to our Error just as much.

The conditional code splits the third case.  Result:

* systemd_supports_mode() returned false with @local_err set
* systemd_supports_mode() returned false with @local_err clear
* systemd_supports_mode() returned true, systemd_suspend() failed,
  @local_err set
* systemd_supports_mode() returned true, systemd_suspend() succeeded,
  @local_err clear

We use @local_err as one bit of information.

You're right, these interfaces are awkward.  They're used just here, so
there's no excuse for keeping them awkward.

Let's step back and examine what we're trying to do.  Pseudo-code:

    for method in systemd, pmutils, linux_sys_state:
        if method supports mode:
            try method
            if successful:
                return success

    if no method supports mode:
        return failure "the requested suspend mode is not supported by the =
guest"
    // we tried at least one method
    return the last method's failure

Observations:

1. We can abstract from the methods, or we can unroll the loop.
   Unrolling seems simpler here.

2. 'Method supports mode' is used as a simple predicate.  So make it
   one: return bool, and not take an Error ** argument.

3. The error for 'try method' is ignored except for the last try.  I'm
   not sure reporting just the last one is appropriate, but let's assume
   it is.  Preferred solution: make 'try method' return true on success,
   false on failure, ignore error (by passing null) unless we actually
   need it.  Acceptable solution: keep it void, free the Error objects
   we ignore.
