Well, when do we have an end point for anything anyway? Things will
always evolve.

They aren't really proper QOM classes at this point. Technically they
are, but they are pretty boring QOM classes that don't have any
properties. Instead, they use ChardevBackend QAPI objects in the custom
ChardevClass.open method.

So they are in some weird in-between state.

I think we need to distinguish legacy options and convenience options
(and this applies much more broadly than just here, and it's probably
more important in other places).

Even if we eventually make -object capable of configuring chardev and
netdev backends, -chardev could still be more convenient to use for a
human user.

This equation of "legacy" and "convenience" is also on of the problems I
have with the suggestion of having two binaries for "legacy" and
"modern" interfaces. Humans are not legacy, and having a command line
that is unfriendly for human users doesn't make it modern.

We have a lot of legacy stuff in the command line, and the goal for it
is to get rid of it and replace it with something modern (the goal is
_not_ keeping it around for human users because compatibility with this
legacy stuff often blocks us from moving forward).

But convenience options for human users aren't bad at all, as long as
they are based on a modern model of how things work. We'll always want
to have some.

Sorry for going on a tangent... Back to chardev: In the end, the
preferred command line interface doesn't matter that much. The required
structure will be the same.

Yes, I agree with this one.

I expect we'll discuss this more when I send the first step for
object-add (which is QMP, so for everything, not just
qemu-storage-daemon), which will duplicate the QOM properties in the
QAPI schema for user creatable objects. Generating QOM code from the
schema should be the next step then.

The challenging part is probably not keeping compatibility (there's no
reason to break it if it represents everything well), but that these are
union types in the QAPI schema that map to different QOM classes.

It's not entirely obvious to me yet how we would deal with this, but the
good thing is that this is all about internal interfaces which we can
change relatively freely.
