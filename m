The ABI specification isn't trying to define a real CPU, so it
doesn't define a full set of features. It is merely setting a
minimum bar, against which vendor specific CPUs are evaluated
for compliance. IOW, there are multiple AMD and Intel CPUs that
satisfy x86-64-abi1. They will all have have a distinct set of
features, but share a common core. The ABI spec is fairly
focused on the various SIMD matrix instructions in particular.

In this QEMU patch meanwhile, we are attempting to define a
real CPU, so need to spec more than just the core featureset.

I don't have specific bugs off hand. I just know that the traditional
way libvirt implemented host-model by taking a base model and turning
on/off arbitrary features has been a source of bugs.

Taking ABI level 1.

The combination of level 0 and level 1 ABI specifies
these features:

{'popcnt', 'sse4.1', 'sse', 'mmx', 'ssse3', 'pni', 'cx16', 'fpu', 'sse2', 'sse4.2', 'cx8', 'syscall', 'fxsr', 'cmov', 'lahf-lm'}

The Nehalem CPU which I used as a basis for this level provides 

{'hypervisor', 'pge', 'mmx', 'ssse3', 'kvm-nopiodelay', 'pse', 'de', 'sep', 'tsc', 'nx', 'popcnt', 'mtrr', 'kvm-steal-time', 'apic', 'sse2', 'clflush', 'fxsr', 'sse4.1', 'sse', 'cx16', 'syscall', 'x2apic', 'kvmclock-stable-bit', 'pni', 'kvm-pv-eoi', 'kvmclock', 'kvm-asyncpf', 'vme', 'mce', 'msr', 'mca', 'sse4.2', 'fpu', 'cx8', 'lm', 'pse36', 'pat', 'cmov', 'lahf-lm', 'pae'}

So if we removed all features except those explicitly documented
by the ABI spec we loose:

{'hypervisor', 'pge', 'pse', 'kvm-nopiodelay', 'de', 'sep', 'tsc', 'nx', 'mtrr', 'kvm-steal-time', 'apic', 'clflush', 'x2apic', 'kvmclock-stable-bit', 'kvm-pv-eoi', 'kvmclock', 'kvm-asyncpf', 'vme', 'mce', 'msr', 'mca', 'pse36', 'lm', 'pat', 'pae'}

Many (most) of these are pretty important features IMHO. I don't
think you can define a useful CPU without them.

I don't think the minimal is usable in practice.

I'd probably go for the latter option and just ignore v4.

Maybe I'm mis-interpreting things. I didn't think it made sense
to define all the VMX capabilities, if the CPU was later intended
to be used with svm=on, but it sounds like you're saying this is
harmless.

The challenge with the side channel mitigations is that the flags
to be exposed are rather vendor specific, so I don't see a way
to define a single CPU that works for both Intel and AMD hosts
and includes the side channel mods.

I don't think this will make a significant difference, because
libvirt will end up saying live migration is required for
everything it starts, unless libvirt has in turn been told by
a mgmt app that it doesn't need live migration. The biggest
mgmt apps I know (oVirt, OpenStack, KubeVirt) all want live
migration in general. There may be some cases where live
mig is not desired, but I expect it would be 10% or less
of deployments.

Nope, QEMU doesn't have enough info to choose. The only way I
can see is if the OS vendor decides what their baseline is
going to be. eg Fedora explicitly supports all CPUs right back
to first generation x86_64 chips, so to provide runnability on
all possible Fedora hosts, we need qemu64.  In RHEL-9, it was
decided to compile everything with march=x86_64-abi1, so we
can guarantee that x86_64-abi1 is always runnable on any RHEL9
host, and thus can use that instead of qemu64. 


FWIW, I'm totally fine with saying that this concept of defining
CPUs for x86_64 ABI levels is a failed experiment.

To me the real killers are the lack of side channel mitigations
and lack of AES accelerator instructions. Without those, it just
doesn't feel like we're offering a big enough step up over the
qemu64 CPU. We can't add the side channels as it feels too
vendor specific, and we can't add the AES accel, because there
are physical CPUs satisfying abi1, which don't have AES.

At least the documentation of ABI compatibiltiy levels is useful
though.

Given that my x86_64-abi1 CPU is a copy of Nehalem, if RHEL9
did want a newer CPU default, it could just pick Nehalem as
that.
