Any merge request not changing buildsys (configure/Makefile), adding new
(or moving) .c files shouldn't be a problem.

I have that feeling that Meson will have less bottleneck problem than
our Perl scripts =)

Just to clarify, does the "dev cycle" include the freeze window?

QEMU produces a release every 17 weeks, the dev cycle is usually 12
weeks then we have 4 (+1) weeks of stabilization for the release.

So the plan is to get this merged approximately 6 weeks after the
next release, right?

Phil.
