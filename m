Title:
  Maintain Haiku support

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  It was pointed out that the 2.10 release notes are pushing to drop
  Haiku support.  The qemu port is currently working as-is under Haiku.

  Was there a reason this was recommended? Is there anything Haiku can
  do to keep it from being dropped?

  We're working on a docker container to cross-compile rust-lang for
  Haiku, could this be of some use to qemu when complete?
