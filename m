This error can be hit by the destination during migration if the
incoming stream is corrupted. Aborting in this case would mislead
the user into suspecting a bug in the destination QEMU, which isn't
the case.

Appart from that, when the in-kernel XICS is in use, only two functions
manipulate the ICS state: ics_set_kvm_state_one() and ics_get_kvm_state().
The code is trivial enough that I don't see a great value in the assert
in the first place... BTW, it comes from the commit:

    xics-kvm: Support for in-kernel XICS interrupt controller

Maybe you remember some context that justified the assert at the time ?
