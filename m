Libvirt will only ever expand a bare CPU model at time it first parses
the XML. So if a mgmt app defines a new persistent guest in libvirt, the
CPU is expanded them and remains unchanged thereafter, in order to preserve
ABI compat.

If using transient guests its different as libvirt doesn't store the config
in disk when the guest isn't running. So mgmt apps using transient guests
are responsible  for picking a explicit versioned model themselves if they
need stable ABI.

I don't know s390x much, but can we really assume that users promptly
install firmware updates, any better than users do for x86 or other
arch. IME corporate beaurcracy can drag out time to update arbitrarily
long.

Yes, you can think of "Haswell", "Haswell-noTSX", "Haswell-noTSX-IBRS"
as all being versions of the same thing. There was never any explicit
association or naming though. So what's changing is that we're defining
a sane naming scheme for the variants of each model so we don't end
up with   "Haswell-noTSX-IBRS-SSBD-MDS-WHATEVER-NEXT-INTEL-FLAW-IS",
and we declaring that a bare "Haswell" will expand to some "best"
version depending on machine type (but also selectable by mgmt app
above).

At the QEMU level "haswell" will expand to a particular CPU version
per machine type. So yes, at the QEMU level machine types might have
a dependancy on the host.

Above QEMU though, libvirt/mgmt apps can be more dynamic in how they
expand a bare "haswell" to take account of what the host supports.
