Public bug reported:

The following guest code:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/3604174718e2afc950c3cc64c64ba5165c86=
92bd/MdePkg/Library/BaseMemoryLibOptDxe/AArch64/CopyMem.S

implements, in hand-optimized aarch64 assembly, the CopyMem() edk2 (EFI
Development Kit II) library function. (CopyMem() basically has memmove()
semantics, to provide a standard C analog here.) The relevant functions
are InternalMemCopyMem() and __memcpy().

When TCG translates this aarch64 code to x86_64, everything works fine.

When TCG translates this aarch64 code to ARMv7, the destination area of
the translated CopyMem() function becomes corrupted -- it differs from
the intended source contents. Namely, in every 4096 byte block, the
8-byte word at offset 4032 (0xFC0) is zeroed out in the destination,
instead of receiving the intended source value.

I'm attaching two hexdumps of the same destination area:

- "good.txt" is a hexdump of the destination area when CopyMem() was
  translated to x86_64,

- "bad.txt" is a hexdump of the destination area when CopyMem() was
  translated to ARMv7.

In order to assist with the analysis of this issue, I disassembled the
aarch64 binary with "objdump". Please find the listing in
"DxeCore.objdump", attached. The InternalMemCopyMem() function starts at
hex offset 2b2ec. The __memcpy() function starts at hex offset 2b180.

And, I ran the guest on the ARMv7 host with "-d
in_asm,op,op_opt,op_ind,out_asm". Please find the log in
"tcg.in_asm.op.op_opt.op_ind.out_asm.log", attached.

The TBs that correspond to (parts of) the InternalMemCopyMem() and
__memcpy() functions are scattered over the TCG log file, but the offset
between the "nice" disassembly from "DxeCore.objdump", and the in-RAM
TBs in the TCG log, can be determined from the fact that there is a
single prfm instruction in the entire binary. The instruction's offset
is 0x2b180 in "DxeCore.objdump" -- at the beginning of the __memcpy()
function --, and its RAM address is 0x472d2180 in the TCG log. Thus the
difference (=3D the load address of DxeCore.efi) is 0x472a7000.

QEMU was built at commit a4f667b67149 ("Merge remote-tracking branch
'remotes/cohuck/tags/s390x-20190521-3' into staging", 2019-05-21).

The reproducer command line is (on an ARMv7 host):

  qemu-system-aarch64 \
    -display none \
    -machine virt,accel=3Dtcg \
    -nodefaults \
    -nographic \
    -drive if=3Dpflash,format=3Draw,file=3D$prefix/share/qemu/edk2-aarch64-=
code.fd,readonly \
    -drive if=3Dpflash,format=3Draw,file=3D$prefix/share/qemu/edk2-arm-vars=
.fd,snapshot=3Don \
    -cpu cortex-a57 \
    -chardev stdio,signal=3Doff,mux=3Don,id=3Dchar0 \
    -mon chardev=3Dchar0,mode=3Dreadline \
    -serial chardev:char0

The apparent symptom is an assertion failure *in the guest*, such as

> ASSERT [DxeCore]
> /home/lacos/src/upstream/qemu/roms/edk2/MdePkg/Library/BaseLib/String.c(1=
090):
> Length < _gPcd_FixedAtBuild_PcdMaximumAsciiStringLength

but that is only a (distant) consequence of the CopyMem()
mistranslation, and resultant destination area corruption.
