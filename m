I think DATA means that the data for this block is provided by *file. I
wouldn't necessarily understand it to mean that the data actually takes
up physical disk space there.

It means that you need to read from bs itself to get the correct data
(which will be zero). Even though OFFSET_VALID is set, reading from
*file (typically bs->file->bs) at the returned offset might not give the
right result.

Correct.

This doesn't make sense to me. Reading from a node is always correct.

But you're right that DATA seems to mean something slightly different at
the protocol level because *file cannot have a meaningful value for the
lower layer there. In this case, DATA still seems to mean that the data
is fetched from the lower layer (i.e. the block device on which the file
system resides). For holes, this is not the case.

With the above explanation, DATA shouldn't be set for holes.

But it's still kind of inconsistent because OFFSET_VALID and the offset
refer to bs itself and not to the lower layer.

Hm... This is a mess. :-)
