I can accept this as a perfectly valid design. Which would mean, QEMU sho=
uld mark each hotpluggable RAM range in the DTB for the firmware with the=
 special new property, regardless of its initial ("cold") plugged-ness, a=
nd then the firmware will not expose the range in the GCD memory space ma=
p, and consequently in the UEFI memmap either.

IOW, our table is, thus far:

OS boot (DT/ACPI)  hotpluggable & ...  GetMemoryMap() should report as  D=
T/ACPI should report as
-----------------  ------------------  -------------------------------  -=
-----------------------
DT                 present             ABSENT                           ?
DT                 absent              ABSENT                           ?
ACPI               present             ABSENT                           P=
RESENT
ACPI               absent              ABSENT                           A=
BSENT

In the firmware, I only need to care about the GetMemoryMap() column, so =
I can work with this. Can someone please file a feature request at <https=
://bugzilla.tianocore.org/>, for the ArmVirtPkg Package, with these detai=
s?

Thanks
Laszlo
