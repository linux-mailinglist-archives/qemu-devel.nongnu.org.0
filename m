That's why I suggested ".machine", as all the APIs there currently
are focused on the machine emulators, and the linx-user binaries
share essentially nothing in common with softmmu binaries in terms
of control APIs / CLI config. We can add a "qemu.user" package
later if we have stuff related to that to expose
