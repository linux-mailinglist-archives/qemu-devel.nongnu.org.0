Title:
  ARM: HCR.TSW traps are not implemented

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  On 32-bit and 64-bit ARM platforms, setting HCR.TSW is supposed to
  "Trap data or unified cache maintenance instructions that operate by
  Set/Way." Quoting the ARM manual:

  If EL1 is using AArch64 state, accesses to DC ISW, DC CSW, DC CISW are tr=
apped to EL2, reported using EC syndrome value 0x18.
  If EL1 is using AArch32 state, accesses to DCISW, DCCSW, DCCISW are trapp=
ed to EL2, reported using EC syndrome value 0x03.

  However, QEMU does not trap those instructions/registers. This was
  tested on the branch master of the git repo.
