Other than probing they're almost the same, except the inversion.
This one's more complete for set / get multiple etc.

They can be given line names via the dt property gpio-line-names.
Which can be used by user space to find a gpio. Not sure if there's an equivalent api inkerenl.
But it looks like we can find the info via struct gpiochip_info / gpioline_info linfo and work
out the chip name and line offsets. So probably not required.

Find the right gpio always seems tricky.
We have systems with multiple i2c gpio behind muxes that may or may not be present.
So i2c bus numbers are never consistent. And then different board revisions move the
same gpio line to a different pin (or cahnge the gpio chip type completely) to make routing easier etc.
