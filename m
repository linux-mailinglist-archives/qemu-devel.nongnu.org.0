Usual way to add firmware:

  (1) Add a submodule below roms/
  (2) Add rules to build the firmware to roms/Makefile.  Firmware
      maintainers can use them, and they also document the build process.
      A normal qemu build will not automatically build the firmware
      though.
  (3) Place a pre-built binary in pc-bios/

There is some cross compiler detection logic in roms/Makefile which you
can use.

cheers,
