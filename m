This code implements the logic that I explained above. In my example,
the zeros are produced by overlay.qcow2 (because we're reading after its
EOF), not by base.qcow2.

If it were allocated at base.qcow2, you wouldn't read zeros, but the
data from (the longer) base.qcow2.

The code I posted isn't quite correct yet, but I think that the core of
the problem is already present in bdrv_co_block_status() and not only in
its callers.
