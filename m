There is no need to reserve bit#0 if in step #5 we use s/'command data'/'Co=
mmand data 2'/

Alternatively we can reserve bit#0 and sequentially read upper half from 'C=
ommand data'
(one a new flag to show that there is more data to read).
(Upper half currently is not necessary, it's there for future ARM's MPIDR).

One more thing, this behavior is based on artifacts of x86 machine and AllO=
nes fallback.
Obviously it won't work with arm/virt, do we care about AVMF at this point?
