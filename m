Use of "indent" as a noun was new to me, but what do I know; you're the
native speaker.  Use your judgement.  Applies to the class name, too.

Meh.  There's another three dozen classes for you to put lipstick on :)

I think assert(amount <= self._level) would do just fine.

Works for me.  So would inc and dec.
