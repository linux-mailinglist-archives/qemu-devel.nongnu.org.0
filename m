All,

I'm finding myself needing to pass in some information to cloud-init in
some VM's in a non-cloud environment.

cloud-init is a (very) widely used tool for applying some initial
configuration to VM's. It originally exclusively used AWS's EC2's metadata
and userdata service, but has since been extended to use many other
configuration sources. The volume of the configuration varies a lot. For my
use, they will be several kB (passing in various certificates, etc.). For
non-cloud environments, the traditional source for user-data configuration
has been an ISO with the relevant configuration files. This feels
anachronistic to me.

I raised a feature request with cloud-init to have it support fw_cfg as a
configuration source: https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1879294

I was told that there was already a feature request to use SMBIOS fields to
do the same: https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1753558

Dan Berrang=C3=A9 (of libvirt fame) pointed out (in that latter bug report)=
 that
the qemu developers advised against using fw_cfg for this sort of thing. I
have no particular reason to doubt him, but I'd still like to hear from the
horse's own mouth and try to understand why.

While I can certainly find a way to serialize my config blob into a single
string with no NULLs (per SMBIOS spec) and pass it in through the SMBIOS
interface, the fw_cfg approach seems a whole lot simpler for both the user
and for cloud-init. Also, having gotten so used to cloud-init just being
there, personally it doesn't feel like much of a stretch to think of it as
a sort of firmware.

Can someone enlighten me on why using fw_cfg is the wrong way to go?

Best regards,
Soren L. Hansen
