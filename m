My point is that already breaks if you used a smaller firmware on the
source and the current size on the destination.

I don't think there is a migration aspect here; and this knob is a
general knob - it's just Erich here is the poor unfortunate person
who wanted to tune that knob for the first time.

Sorry, not QEMU's problem; we don't restrict RAM to 640k just because
it should be enough for anyone.

I'm not seeing any more risks, reviews or maintenance in QEMU due to it.
Indeed replacing an undocumented, unchecked constant comparison with
a proper property seems better.

We have lots of complex hideous changes that I'm never going to use but
seem reasonable;  this is a tiny change that seems perfectly reasonable
both for open and closed firmware.
I realise herding OVMF developers is tricky, but that's not a reason
to nack a reasonable almost trivial change in QEMU.
