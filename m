I guess I need to be more specific about what I mean with "QAPI". Of
course, many things you can't currently do in QAPI because they are not
implemented. When I'm talking about that QAPI should be used more, I'm
mostly talking about applying its core concepts and infrastructure with
the obvious extensions in some places, not about the existing
implementation.

So I guess "a forward evoluion of QAPI" is what I really have in mind.

Well, you can't because it's not implemented. Implementing it from
scratch without compatibility requirements would be relatively easy, and
we're in fact going to try it out with the qemu-storage-daemon.

But there is nothing in defining a command line option that would
inherently be different in structure from defining a QMP command, so I
would consider providing a command line option that is described by a
QAPI type not a problem, even though it's not implemented yet.

Compatibility is much harder, which is not the least because the
existing command line options are bad (primarily: using inconsistent
syntax). The question is if we should make bad options work unchanged in
the new infrastructure or if it wouldn't be better to replace them with
something that behaves the same as the rest.

I would rather say that .def should go away and its content should
be converted to a JSON schema that becomes the new source format rather
than an intermediate generated file. There is nothing in .def files that
couldn't be represented in the schema.

To a certain degree, QAPI does just that, by supporting different data
types for options. If necessary, I'm sure the type system could be
extended, but it's not clear to me to which degree we actually need
this.

Just drawing parallels from what we do for QMP commands, I imagine
something like this to describe the -m option as it actually exists in
qemu-options.def today:

##
# @m:
#
# Configure guest RAM.
#
# @size: initial amount of guest memory
# @slots: number of hotplug slots (default: none)
# @maxmem: maximum amount of guest memory (default: none)
##
{ 'cmdline-option': 'm',
  'arguments': {
    'size': 'size',
    'slots': '*int',
    'maxmem': '*size'
  },
  'default-key': 'size',
  'repeat': 'OVERRIDE' }

HAS_ARG is automatically covered simply by 'arguments' being non-empty.

(Markus probably already has a prototype with slightly different syntax,
but the idea should be similar.)

We could. But is it actually worth inventing a new programming language?
I think this is something that should be done in C code even in the
future. I think what we're looking for is a way to describe interfaces,
not implementations.

Even just for adding more sophisticated constraints, like in the example
above that maxmem >=3D size, it's questionable whether doing this in the
schema provides enough value for actually implementing it there.

So what are the things that you would like to describe, but can't see an
easy way to actually describe them with QAPI concepts?

That's not really close enough. If you are happy with this level of
abstraction, you can define any command line option to be either a flag
or take a string as its argument and be done. This is obviously not very
helpful because it says nothing about the structure of that string. In
the same way, QAPI can't say anything about the structure of a QOM
object, and I think that's a problem.

My point is that for example you can't generate a C struct (which is
statically defined) from something that has a dynamic structure. The
best you could do is fall back to key=3Dvalue even in the C source, both
key and value being strings. But then you still have to parse these
strings manually, so it doesn't actually help much compared to a state
without C bindings.

Maybe what could be done is covering at least the static properties and
then having key=3Dvalue for the dynamic part (which should be the
exception).

I didn't necessarily mean relations/state/verbs, which obviously exist,
but the examples that seemed to express things in a deliberately
different way from what we have today.

We have a 'transaction' QMP command, but they are not an integral part
of the language. Considering the trouble to implement transactional
commands, I suppose we don't even want it to be a fundamental part of
the language.

Though we always need to keep in mind that if requiring less for future
additions requires a huge effort now, the investment may pay off only in
a very distant future (if the abstraction we build even survives until
then).
