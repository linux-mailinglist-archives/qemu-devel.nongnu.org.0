Yes exactly. The guest creates a mapping between one giova and this gpa
(corresponding to the MSI controller doorbell) because MSIs are mapped
on ARM. But practically the physical device is programmed with an host
chosen iova that maps onto the physical MSI controller's doorbell. so
the device never performs DMA accesses to this range.

yes makes sense.

  Maybe there's an argument to be made

MSI doorbells are mapped using the IOMMU_MMIO flag (dma-iommu.c
iommu_dma_get_msi_page).
One idea could be to pass that flag through the IOMMU Notifier mechanism
into the iotlb->perm. Eventually when we get this in vfio_get_vaddr() we
would not print the warning. Could that make sense?

Thanks

Eric
