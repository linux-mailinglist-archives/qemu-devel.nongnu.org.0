Is this really a pattern that exists and we want to follow?
I don't see why that pattern would be useful for simple leaf
types.

Also, in this case the code wasn't even following that pattern:
it was using the same IDEDrive struct for all TYPE_IDE_DEVICE
subtypes.

I think we should include the instance struct/macros in the
recommendations there, but I would expect those recommendations
to apply only to non-leaf types.
