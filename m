I think part of the pain of qmp-shell comes from the very fact that
it is trying to be an interactive shell. This points people towards
interactively typing in the commands, which is horrific when you get
anywhere near the JSON, or even dot-notation traditional commands.

If it was just a qmp-client that was single shot, we'd encourage
people to create the JSON in a sensible way - vim/emacs/whatever.

Bash/dash/zsh/$whatever is their interactive shell, with massively
more features than qmp-shell. You have command history, autocomplete,
conditional and looping constructs, and everything a normal shell
offers.

The only strong reason for qmp-shell to be interactive would be if
the initial protoocl handshake was too slow. I can't see that being
a problem with QMP.=20

Here's one conceptual vision of how a better QEMU might look:

  * qemu-runtime-$TARGET

    A binary that contains the implementation for the machine
    emulator for $TARGET.

    This has no command line arguments except for a UNIX
    socket path which is a QMP server


  * qemu-launcher-$TARGET

    A binary that is able to launch qemu-runtime-$TARGET
    with jailers active.

    This has no command line arguments except for a pair
    of UNIX socket paths. One is a QMP server, the other
    is the path for the QMP of qemu-runtime-$TARGET.

    Commands it processes will be in automatically proxied
    through to the qemu-runtime-$TARGET QMP, with appropriate
    jailer updates being done in between.


  * qemu-client

    A binary that speaks QMP, connects, runs a single command,
    disconnects.

    It is used to talk to either qemu-runtime-$TARGET or
    qemu-launcher-$TARGET, depending on whether the mgmt app
    or user wants to be making use of the jailer facilities
    or not. =20


  * qemu-system-$TARGET

    The current binaries that exist today.

    qemu-system-$TARGET should not be part of our formal
    stability promise. We won't gratuitously / knowingly
    break without good reason, but we will accept that
    breakage can happen. Stability is only offered by
    the qemu-{runtime,launcher}-$TARGET.

    Several choices for their future in long term:

      - Leave them as-is and basically ignore them
        whereever practical going forward, so we
=09minimally worry about backcompat breakage

      - Plan to re-write them so that they are simply
        a shim the forks+execs qemu-runtime-$TARGET
=09and does syntax translation from CLI/HMP/QMP.

      - Deprecate them with a view to deletion entirely
        in $NNN years. For some large-ish value of NNN,
=09given how well known they are


Example usage:

1. Launch the QEMU runtime for the desired target

     $ qemu-runtime-x86_64 myvm.sock

2. Load the configuration to define the VM

   $ cat myvm.yaml
   commands:
     - machine_declare:
         name: pc-q35-5.0
=09 ...
     - blockdev_add:
         ...
     - device_add:
         ...
     - blockdev_add:
         ...
     - device_add:
         ...
   $ qemu-client myvm.sock myvm.yaml


3. Hotplug a disk

   $ cat mynewdisk.yaml
   commands:
     - blockdev_add:
         ...
     - device_add:
         ...
   $ qemu-client myvm.sock mynewdisk.yaml


3. Hotunplug a disk

   $ cat myolddisk.yaml
   commands:
     - device_del:
         ...
     - blockdev_del:
         ...
   $ qemu-client myvm.sock myolddisk.yaml

Using jailers, just means adding in a use of qemu-launcher-$TARGET
at the start.

Daniel
