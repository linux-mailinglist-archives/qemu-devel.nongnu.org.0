It depends on the case, but yes, I had similar thoughts, at least when
we're talking about non-trivial parts of a function. (Very short
functions of just some initial checks returning directly are usually
fine.)

So what is your plan for getting the series merged? Should maintainers
just picks patches from the series, or do you want to collect Acked-by
tags and then merge it through a single tree? If the latter, which one?
