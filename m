Unfortunately this patch really does break NetBSD/arc 5.1, just as
Laurent said it would, just as commit c744cf7879 did.

Yet these patches are correct. What gives?

I found that one more change can make guests work (for both m68k q800 and 
mips64el magnum machines) --

--- a/hw/net/dp8393x.c
+++ b/hw/net/dp8393x.c
@@ -246,8 +246,10 @@ static void dp8393x_put(dp8393xState *s, int width, 
int offset,
                         uint16_t val)
 {
     if (s->big_endian) {
+        s->data[offset * width] = 0;
         s->data[offset * width + width - 1] = cpu_to_be16(val);
     } else {

         s->data[offset * width] = cpu_to_le16(val);
     }
 }

For a wide bus interface, this forces the Most Significant Word (MSW) to 
zero. Yet another endianness hack, but it makes NetBSD 5.1 'sn' driver 
happy.

There is a similar issue with the Linux jazzsonic driver. This driver uses 
long-word-sized loads with word-sized MMIO registers --

#define SONIC_READ(reg) (*((volatile unsigned int *)dev->base_addr+reg))

This driver also expects the MSW to be zero. But the MSW actually equals 
the LSW, and the driver fails to probe:

SONIC ethernet controller not found (0x40004)

This seems to indicate that qemu-system-mips64el -M magnum is doing word 
smearing on the processor bus. Does anyone know how to prevent that?
