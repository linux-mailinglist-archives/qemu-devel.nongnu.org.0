GitLab doesn't expose anyone's email address. Any interaction with other
users is exclusively via their GitLab user name. So yes, you need an
account to be added to notifications for an issue.

Why is that ?  I find the tagging to be one of the things i really
like coming over from the bugzilla world. It is useful for doing an
initial triage of bugs in particular, to sort them into logical buckets.

I think that's particularly useful with our subsystem maintainer model,
as it will let us direct bugs towards specific maintainers.

In libvirt we had some generic labels for all projects

  https://gitlab.com/groups/libvirt/-/labels

And then further project specific labels

  https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/labels

I believe only admins can define the tags, you can't add arbitrary
tags to a project as a user.
