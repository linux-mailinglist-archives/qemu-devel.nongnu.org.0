I can look into that. Those 12 wasted bytes are a bit ugly, but so far 
we are not short on config space, even in the non-extended range.

More problematic is that the existing specification of virtio_pci_cap 
assumes that this describes a structure in a PCI resource, rather than 
even being that data itself, and even a register (privileged control).

Would it be possible to split the types into two ranges, one for the 
existing structure, one for others - like ivshmem - that will only share 
the cfg_type field?

Right. But then it would not a be a problem to add PCIe (right before 
adding it becomes impossible) and push new caps into the extended space. 
And all that without breaking existing drivers. It's just a cap, and the 
spec so far does not state that there must be no other cap, neither in 
current virtio nor this ivshmem device.
