Architecturally, there are two completely separate physical
address spaces for Secure and NonSecure.
In actual Arm hardware, what you get is a bus/interconnect
where effectively the 'S/NS' line is an extra address bit.
The interconnect can set things up however it likes, but the
most common setup is "most devices mapped at the same address
in both S and NS", aka "most decode ignores the S/NS signal",
with some "this device is only present in S". There's no inherent
reason you couldn't have "address A is device X in S and device
Y in NS", though.

I think the slowpath uses the MemTxAttrs rather than the mmu_idx:
iotlb_to_section() calls cpu_asidx_from_attrs() and then pulls the
AddressSpace out of cpu->cpu_ases[].

From the point of view of a plugin, it probably wants
the (hwaddr, MemTxAttrs) for the access.

I'd need to go and look at the overall plugin-facing API to
be sure, but in general my expectation would be that the
whole API should be in terms of guest-architectural concepts,
with no QEMU-isms like ramaddrs leaking through.
