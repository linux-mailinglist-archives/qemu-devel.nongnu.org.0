Ok, I'll add some of the trivial suggestions and take this patch through
my gitlab tree, so Peter can start integrating the gitlab CI in his
merge workflow. We can then later add additional features like the
parameter for the branch name or the logging class.
(I'll skip the second patch for now since there were more questions
raised there which should likely be answered / discussed first)
