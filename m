Hmmm yes I see that qemu-system-ppc64 fails because target_ulong will always 
represent a 64-bit quantity, even if you request a 32-bit CPU. Rather than add some 
CPU-specific code let's keep the uint32_t cast for now as I would hope it is unlikely 
someone would load an ELF in high memory, and perhaps the sign-extended address bug 
will get fixed later.

With the cast reverted to uint32_t then for patches 1 and 2:
Reviewed-by: Mark Cave-Ayland <mark.cave-ayland@ilande.co.uk>

If you can send a v9 with the cast fixed I'll apply this to my qemu-macppc branch 
right away.


ATB,

Mark.
