Sure, I respect the opinion of both Paolo and Thomas. I already reflected
on everything, and will not be an obstacle in any way in qemu community.

There is truly no ulterior motive from my side regarding this pull request
- I was just trying to integrate some code before soft-freeze.

Peter, please discard this pull request, I will send a new one, as soon as
I can, most likely tomorrow, that will fully follow Paolo's and Thomas'
recommendations, no need to worry.

Thanks,
Aleksamdar
