Currently, we set PostcopyState blindly to RUNNING, even we found the
previous state is not LISTENING. This will lead to a corner case.

First let's look at the code flow:

qemu_loadvm_state_main()
    ret = loadvm_process_command()
        loadvm_postcopy_handle_run()
            return -1;
    if (ret < 0) {
        if (postcopy_state_get() == POSTCOPY_INCOMING_RUNNING)
            ...
    }

>From above snippet, the corner case is loadvm_postcopy_handle_run()
always sets state to RUNNING. And then it checks the previous state. If
the previous state is not LISTENING, it will return -1. But at this
moment, PostcopyState is already been set to RUNNING.

Then ret is checked in qemu_loadvm_state_main(), when it is -1
PostcopyState is checked. Current logic would pause postcopy and retry
if PostcopyState is RUNNING. This is not what we expect, because
postcopy is not active yet.

This patch makes sure state is set to RUNNING only previous state is
LISTENING by checking the state first.
