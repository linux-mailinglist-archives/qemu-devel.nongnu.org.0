I'm not opposed to making only a first step now. The interface seems to
make sense to me; the only thing that I don't really like is the naming
both of the operation (blk_co_pcache) and of the flag (BDRV_REQ_CACHE)
because to me, "cache" doesn't mean "read, but ignore the result".

The operation only results in something being cached if the block graph
is configured to cache things. And indeed, the most importatn use case
for the flag is not populating a cache, but triggering copy-on-read. So
I think calling this operation "cache" is misleading.

Now, I don't have very good ideas for better names either. I guess
BDRV_REQ_NO_DATA could work, though it's not perfect. (Also, not sure if
a blk_co_preadv_no_read wrapper is even needed when you can just call
blk_co_preadv with the right flag.)

I'm open for good naming ideas.

Kevin
