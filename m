OK, now:

Hi,

My recent series =E2=80=9Ciotests: Allow ./check -o data_file=E2=80=9D en=
abled our bash
tests to interpret the data_file qcow2 option.  It didn=E2=80=99t do anyt=
hing
for Python tests because those currently completely ignore all image
format options.

This is where it gets hairy.  To do so, we need two things: First of
all, whatever way Python tests use to create images needs to interpret
$IMGOPTS.  Second, when deleting image files, they must not use a plain
os.remove(), but a special function that will clean up data files, too.

The heap of patches in this series comes from making the Python tests
use these new functions.

Most Python tests just run qemu-img through a helper function that does
not care about the exact subcommand to create images.  I could add
$IMGOPTS support to it, but that doesn=E2=80=99t feel quite right to me, =
and it
wouldn=E2=80=99t reduce the patch count because we still need a special r=
emoval
function.


This series is structured as follows:
- Patches 1 through 7 add support to handle image files differently from
  other files (consider $IMGOPTS when creating them, consider data files
  when deleting them, separate ImagePaths from FilePaths, and so on)

- Patches 8 and 9 add two filters we=E2=80=99ll need in the next range:

- Patches 10 through 13 address some issues in a handful of tests that
  just need to be changed a little so they can overall work with some
  format options

- Patch 14 makes all tests pass unsupported_imgopts where there are
  options that they cannot support.

- Patches 15 through 65 make all Python tests use the new functions
  introduced in the first 7 patches so they no longer ignore $IMGOPTS.

  I felt like this is much better than munching everything together into
  a single big commit (better to rebase, better to review), and I don=E2=80=
=99t
  really like ideas like =E2=80=9CJust do five patches that each address =
ten
  iotests=E2=80=9D.

  But I=E2=80=99m still very much open to suggestions on how to combine t=
hese
  many small patches to reduce the overall patch count.

- Patch 66 ensures that Python tests always use the new function to
  create test images so they won=E2=80=99t bypass $IMGOPTS.

- Patch 67 cleans up.  qemu_img_log() is only used for image creation,
  and I don=E2=80=99t see the point in that.  The output is predictable a=
nd it
  is very unlikely to fail.  We can see in the bash tests that regularly
  we basically just filter everything from it anyway.
  (So this series replaces log(qemu_img_pipe()) instances by asserting
  that image creation did not fail.)
  ((qemu_img_create() obviously no longer has any use after this
  series.))


After this series, running the iotests with -o compat=3D0.10,
-o refcount_bits=3D1, and -o 'data_file=3D$TEST_IMG.data_file' does
something sensible even for the Python tests, and it passes.
