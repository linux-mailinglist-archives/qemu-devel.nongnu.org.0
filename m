I think you need to support older versions that don't ship openpty(),
as 11.4 dropped support for a lot of older hardware so people with
existing (older but working) hardware won't be able to upgrade to it.

Also, illumos doesn't (yet) have openpty.

No, that doesn&#39;t sound right. The code in qemu-openpty.c<br>
for Solaris assumes that solaris does not provide<br>
openpty(), and so it provides its own implementation.<br>
This is a very old bit of portability-workaround. It<br>
sounds like at least some Solaris versions do provide<br>
a system openpty() in termios.h (in libc, or perhaps<br>
needing an extra -lsomething?), in which case we want<br>
to detect that and use it (not compiling the QEMU<br>
code for solaris-without-openpty).<br>
<br>
The first thing to do here would be to find out which<br>
versions of Solaris provide openpty(), and which header<br>
and library need to be used to compile code that uses it.<br>
The gnulib docs think it is missing on Solaris 11.3:<br>
do we care about supporting that as a host OS?<br>
