Yes.

We need to define end-of-support for Debian: is it Debian proper or is
it Debian LTS?

<https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable>:

    Q) How long will security updates be provided?

    The security team tries to support a stable distribution for about
    one year after the next stable distribution has been released,
    except when another stable distribution is released within this
    year.  It is not possible to support three distributions; supporting
    two simultaneously is already difficult enough.

<https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>:

    Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime
    of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years.  Debian LTS is
    not handled by the Debian security team, but by a separate group of
    volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

    Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the
    various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian 10 "Buster" was released in July 2019.  Debian 9 "Stretch" will
receive security updates from Debian until mid 2020, i.e. just about
when Python 3.5 reaches EOL.  LTS will attempt to support it until June
2022.

I think we should give ourselves a bit more flexibility than the
categorical "Support for the previous major version will be dropped 2
years after the new major version is released."  At some point, the cost
of supporting old hosts exceeds the utility.  We should face this
tradeoff.

> patch Python3.5 all the way up until July 2021?

June 2022 even.

We use Python at compile time with trusted input.  The need for security
maintenance is relatively low there.  I'm not ready to vouch for "and we
don't use Python for anything else".
