This is another attempt at implementing the host side of the
net_failover concept
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/net_failover.html)

Changes since last RFC:
- work around circular dependency of commandline options. Just add
  failover=3Don to the virtio-net standby options and reference it from
  primary (vfio-pci) device with standby=3D<id> =20
- add patch 3/4 to allow migration of vfio-pci device when it is part of =
a
  failover pair, still disallow for all other devices
- add patch 4/4 to allow unplug of device during migrationm, make an
  exception for failover primary devices. I'd like feedback on how to
  solve this more elegant. I added a boolean to DeviceState, have it
  default to false for all devices except for primary devices.=20
- not tested yet with surprise removal
- I don't expect this to go in as it is, still needs more testing but
  I'd like to get feedback on above mentioned changes.

The general idea is that we have a pair of devices, a vfio-pci and a
emulated device. Before migration the vfio device is unplugged and data
flows to the emulated device, on the target side another vfio-pci device
is plugged in to take over the data-path. In the guest the net_failover
module will pair net devices with the same MAC address.

* In the first patch the infrastructure for hiding the device is added
  for the qbus and qdev APIs.=20

* In the second patch the virtio-net uses the API to defer adding the vfi=
o
  device until the VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY feature is acked.

Previous discussion:=20
  RFC v1 https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/989098/
  RFC v2 https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg606906.htm=
l

To summarize concerns/feedback from previous discussion:
1.- guest OS can reject or worse _delay_ unplug by any amount of time.
  Migration might get stuck for unpredictable time with unclear reason.
  This approach combines two tricky things, hot/unplug and migration.=20
  -> We can surprise-remove the PCI device and in QEMU we can do all
     necessary rollbacks transparent to management software. Will it be
     easy, probably not.
2. PCI devices are a precious ressource. The primary device should never
  be added to QEMU if it won't be used by guest instead of hiding it in
  QEMU.=20
  -> We only hotplug the device when the standby feature bit was
     negotiated. We save the device cmdline options until we need it for
     qdev_device_add()
     Hiding a device can be a useful concept to model. For example a
     pci device in a powered-off slot could be marked as hidden until the=
 slot is
     powered on (mst).
3. Management layer software should handle this. Open Stack already has
  components/code to handle unplug/replug VFIO devices and metadata to
  provide to the guest for detecting which devices should be paired.
  -> An approach that includes all software from firmware to
     higher-level management software wasn't tried in the last years. Thi=
s is
     an attempt to keep it simple and contained in QEMU as much as possib=
le.
4. Hotplugging a device and then making it part of a failover setup is
   not possible
  -> addressed by extending qdev hotplug functions to check for hidden
     attribute, so e.g. device_add can be used to plug a device.


I have tested this with a mlx5 NIC and was able to migrate the VM with
above mentioned workarounds for open problems.

Command line example:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 3072 -smp 3 \
        -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Dsplit -cpu host   \
        -k fr   \
        -serial stdio   \
        -net none \
        -qmp unix:/tmp/qmp.socket,server,nowait \
        -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot0,multifunction=3Don,chassis=3D0,=
addr=3D0xa \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot1,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D1 \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot2,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D2 \
        -netdev tap,script=3D/root/bin/bridge.sh,downscript=3Dno,id=3Dhos=
tnet1,vhost=3Don \
        -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet1,id=3Dnet1,mac=3D52:54:00=
:6f:55:cc,bus=3Droot2,failover=3Don \                                    =
                                               =20
        /root/rhel-guest-image-8.0-1781.x86_64.qcow2

Then the primary device can be hotplugged via
 (qemu) device_add vfio-pci,host=3D5e:00.2,id=3Dhostdev0,bus=3Droot1,stan=
dby=3Dnet1


I'm grateful for any remarks or ideas!

Thanks!
