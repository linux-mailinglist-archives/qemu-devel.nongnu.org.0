I simply assumed that management applications will just assume that a
newly created image is zero.

I=E2=80=99m aware that may be wrong, but then again, that hasn=E2=80=99t st=
opped them in
the past or they would have asked for qemu to deliver this information
earlier...  (That doesn=E2=80=99t mean that at some point maybe they will s=
tart
to care and ask for it.)

One problem with delivering this information of course is that it=E2=80=99s
useless.  If qemu knows the image to be zero, then it will do the right
thing by itself, and then the management application doesn=E2=80=99t need t=
o
pass --target-is-zero anymore.

Sure, but the question is who can take the burden the easiest.

The management layer creates the image and then uses it, so it can
easily retain this information.

When qemu creates an image and then uses it in a separate step, it
cannot retain this information.  It has to be stored somewhere
persistently and we have to fetch it.  In the case of qcow2, that works
with a flag.  In other cases...  Well, in any case it isn=E2=80=99t as triv=
ial
as in a management application.

And it=E2=80=99s a common case with blockdev-create.

Hm.  So you mean there isn=E2=80=99t any caller that actually cares about
whether an image is zero, only that it is zero.  That is, they are all
=E2=80=9Cif (!is_zero()) { make_zero(); }=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 which is funct=
ionally the same as
=E2=80=9Cmake_zero();=E2=80=9D alone.  make_zero in turn could and should b=
e a no-op
when the image is known to be zero already.

I actually didn=E2=80=99t think of that.  Sounds good.

Max
