I guess what we should really be checking is that bs->backing is NULL
after the node is fully opened. The challenging part is that the backing
child isn't managed by the block driver, but by the generic block layer,
and .brv_open() comes first. So we don't really have a place to check
this. (And there is also the case that the image is originally opened
with BDRV_O_NO_BACKING and the later bdrv_open_backing_file().)

I don't find preallocation convincing, mostly for two reasons.

First is, old images or images created by another program could miss the
preallocation, but we still shouldn't access the backing file.

The other one is that discard breaks preallocation, so we would also
have to make sure to have a special case in every operation that could
end up discarding clusters (and to add it to every future operation we
might add).

It just sounds very brittle.

Honestly, maybe passing a backing file at runtime to an image that
doesn't logically have one is just a case of "then don't do that".
