Hi Eduardo,

it might very well be that we can extend the QOM hierarchy to achieve this,
this is probably the focus of the other thread with Paolo.

I have some reservations with this approach, which maybe I should mention there (briefly: current accel implementation, its lack of user mode coverage, and the imperfect mapping between the accel cpu behavior we need and the actual accel class (in particular for whpx, hax, qtest).

It might be that these are actually only TODOs, and not blockers.

Fair enough, so that's a point towards keeping the existing "cpu models as subclasses of X86 cpu".

can compatibility issues be addressed effectively with this option?
If so, would it make sense to go even further and expand the whole type tree to have accel-specific models?

Just trying to explore the whole range of possibilities here.
