*If* the conversion is too big a task to permit doing it all at once,
then the step by step strategy you describe makes sense to me.

The trouble with step by step is running out of steam before the final
step.  That would leave us worse off.  Even an overly protracted
conversion would be bad.

Thus, my standard question on any proposed step-by-step conversion:
commitment to finishing it?  I'd be quite happy to take your word for
it.

I wholeheartedly agree with (2).  Reducing magic is the whole point.

Your plan confines new magic to "Makefile rules and external scripts".
We'll get actual reduction only if we can retire or at least radically
simplify them at some point.

I'm more ambivalent on (1).  Yes, making the transition easier for
developers is worth hiding a certain amount of magic out of their way.
But not any amount.  We should try to preserve the targets printed by
"make help".

A PoC for selected tests would be nice.

I wouldn't bother keeping around such an empty shell of a Makefile.

Keeping configure as a wrapper could be marginally more useful, mostly
for people trying to build QEMU for the first time.

Ignorant question: could the switch to Meson enable doing less in
configure?  It's big and sloooow.
