OK that's a lot more complex than the current code, and a bit fragile -
but probably more efficient.
So, I think what you're saying is I need to:
  a) Before we sandbox do the capng_get_caps_process
  b) Before we start a new thread do a capng_save_state and restore it
in the thread

I've got to be pretty careful that I do (a) at the write point so
I've not gained anything we later try and drop.
(But we do save doing the capget() on every time we do this drop/restore
dance).

I think we're ok because:
  a) This code is very local - it does a drop FSETID, a write, restore
FSETID
  b) I'm not sure but I suspect it's used only in the non-uid=3D0 case;=20
the whole thing is just a hack to cause setuid/setgid to be dropped
in the case where it's written by a process that doesn't have FSETID
(hmm I guess if the guest was root but didn't have fsetid then it would
be 0?)

But are you suggesting I need to change something other than the
effective caps in that case?
