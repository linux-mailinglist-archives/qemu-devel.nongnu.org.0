I've got only a few suggestions to improve to wording in the documentatio=

IMO better wording: "This is an optional, RW attribute."

^This sentence essentially duplicates the information from the first sent=
ence,
can we condense it into something like:

"It is used to check the migration compatibility between two mdev devices=
 of the
same mdev type. Typically, the target device has not been created yet at =
the
time of userspace using this attribute to check the migration compatibili=
ty."

I'd rephrase the ^last sentence differently:
"Therefore, userspace is only expected to verify that the mdev types of t=
he
respective devices match and then use the migration_version attribute to
confirm migration compatibility between the source and target mdev device=
s."
