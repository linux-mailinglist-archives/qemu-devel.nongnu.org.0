No, haveing osxsave and ospke was a mistake in the first place (they are
not CPU features at all; they are more like a special way to let
unprivileged programs read some bits of CR4).  For pconfig, it's just
very unlikely.

I think I wasn't very clear, I meant "unsupported by QEMU" when I said
"absent".  Libvirt on the destination knows that from
query-cpu-model-expansion, so it can leave off pconfig if it is not
supported by the destination QEMU.
