Oh, that would be a nice feature.  But while we don't have it,
the following proposal would work too.

Agreed.

Sounds good to me.

The above proposals are cool, I don't think they are
overthinking.

I only meant that we shouldn't be looking to a formal definition
of "slow", because "what exactly is a slow job?" isn't the
important question we should be asking.  "How to avoid timeouts
on CI jobs" is the important question, and your proposals above
help us address that.
