Sets up and arms a bear trap, I'm afraid.

We can rely on code review to ensure a handler we want to
coroutine-enable does not access @cur_mon.  But how can we ensure no
uses creep back?  Not even on error paths, where testing tends to be
ineffective?

@cur_mon goes back to Jan's commit 376253ece48 (March 2009).  Meant to
be merely a stop gap:

    For the case that monitor outputs so far happen without clearly
    identifiable context, the global variable cur_mon is introduced that
    shall once provide a pointer either to the current active monitor (whil=
e
    processing commands) or to the default one. On the mid or long term,
    those use case will be obsoleted so that this variable can be removed
    again.

It's been eleven years, and we haven't really gotten closer to getting
them "obsoleted".  I can't stop you if you want to try.  Myself, I'd
rather give up and eliminate the Monitor * parameter passing.

This goes back to

commit 4ad417baa43424b6b988c52b83989fd95670c113

    error: Print error_report() to stderr if using qmp

    monitor_printf will drop the requested output if cur_mon is qmp (for
    good reason). However these messages are often helpful for debugging
    issues with via libvirt.

    If we know the message won't hit the monitor, send it to stderr.

Use of error_report() in QMP context is wrong more often than not.
Still, spewing the message to stderr is less bad than throwing it away.

It has seen other users over the years.

error_printf_unless_qmp() is a convenient way to print hints for humans.
In HMP context, you reach the human by printing to @cur_mon.  Outside
monitor context, you reach the human by printing to stdout or stderr.
In QMP context, we're talking to a machine.

> Is cur_mon used much in other functions called by QMP handlers?

Marc-Andr=C3=A9 pointed to the file-descriptor passing stuff.

To be sure that's all, we'd have to review all uses of @cur_mon.

I've seen coroutine implementations for C that provide coroutine-local
variables of sorts by managing a thread-local opaque pointer.
