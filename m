I=E2=80=99m using no cache, the above tests were done with aio=3Dnative; I=
=E2=80=99ve sent
another response with aio=3Dthreads numbers.

I=E2=80=99m running qemu directly as follows:

x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 \


    -serial stdio \
    -cdrom ~/tmp/arch.iso \
    -m 4096 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -drive \
  if=3Dnone,id=3Dt,format=3Dqcow2,file=3Dtest/test.qcow2,cache=3Dnone,aio=
=3Dnative \
    -device virtio-scsi \
    -device scsi-hd,drive=3Dt \
    -net user \
    -net nic,model=3Drtl8139 \
    -smp 2,maxcpus=3D2,cores=3D1,threads=3D1,sockets=3D2 \
    -cpu SandyBridge \
    -nodefaults \
    -nographic

The full FIO command line is:

fio --rw=3Drandwrite --bs=3D4k --iodepth=3D8 --runtime=3D1m --direct=3D1 \
    --filename=3D/mnt/foo --name=3Djob1 --ioengine=3Dlibaio --thread \

    --output=3D/tmp/fio_result --fallocate=3Dnone
