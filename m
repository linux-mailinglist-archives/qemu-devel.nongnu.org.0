Based on what we've deprecated so far: most, for a large value of
"most".

Makes sense.

Makes sense, too.

Makes sense, too.

Logging the complete QMP traffic can be invaluable when troubleshooting,
and is unlikely to make users report the warnings to libvirt developers.
But that's a different log / a higher debug level.

That way is madness :)

PATCH 15 makes deprecation visible in introspection.  Like all of this
series, it's limited to commands and events.  Extending to arguments and
return values feels feasible, and I'm willing to do the work.

Argument *values* are a different ballgame.  Schema support for "this
argument is deprecated" is straightforward (tack feature "deprecated" to
it).  Support for "this argument value is deprecated" is not (except for
enumerations, where we can tack feature "deprecated" to the enumeration
value).  Same for return values, combinations of arguments, and so
forth.  Not sure how relevant these are in practice.

I'm not sure how useful the "deprecated" feature will be for guiding
decisions on which interface to use.  I imagine there's typically a list
of interfaces libvirt can use, ordered by "desirability", and the most
desirable interface known to work gets used.  If $new_way is workable,
you use it, else you fall back to $old_way.  Whether $old_way is
deprecated is immaterial.

The "deprecated" feature could be used for dynamic checking, i.e. check
the commands sent to QEMU against the output of query-qmp-schema.  But
that merely duplicates the check QEMU does when it receives it.

Static checking would be more interesting, if we can pull it off.

Understood.

Thanks!
