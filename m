Not sure what you mean by "sorry"... thanks for joining. :)

It's unclear to me how this relates to this use case, perhaps that's
not clear. The idea is that on various cloud deployments, a host could
be temporarily unavailable. Imagine that a network cable snapped. A
management layer could then restart the unreachable VMs elsewhere (as
part of High Availability offerings), but it needs to ensure that
disconnected host is not just going to come back from the dead with
older incarnations of the VMs running. (Imagine that someone replaced
the broken network cable.) That would result in lots of issues from
colliding IP addresses to different writers on shared storage leading
to data corruption.

The ask is for a mechanism to fence the host, essentially causing all
(or selected) VMs on that host to die. There are several mechanisms
for that, mostly requiring some sort of HW support (eg. STONITH).
Those are often focused on cases where the host requires manual
intervention to recover or at least a reset.

I'm looking to implement a mechanism for self-fencing, which doesn't
require external hardware and cover most failure scenarios (from
partially/totally broken hosts to simply a temporary network failure).
In several cases rebooting the host is unnecessary; just ensuring the
VMs are down is enough. That's almost always true on temporary network
unavailability (eg. split network).

Only when this feature is needed (which isn't the case for most
people), there would be an extra thread (according to the latest
proposal) which is mostly idle. It would wake up every few seconds and
stat() a file, which is a very lightweight operation. That would not
measurably impact/jitter other work.

I hope the above clarifies the idea.
