In the perfect world I think we need both because they satisfy different
scenarios.

There are people who are so paranoid they don't want the insecure code
compiled at all. They want a binary guaranteed to only have the trustworthy
code.

Then there are the people who just want protection against making silly
mistakes in their configuration, but want to be able choose between the
features at runtime.

For security researchers reporting issues, I think we already do enough
by documenting what we consider in / out of scope.  In most cases we
can quickly identify whether the reported flaw is in or out of scope.
So I wouldn't think too much about what to do for security researchers.

It is more productive to focus on what our real users needs.

Daniel
