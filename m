Should we remove the Armbian based tests? I don't have any problem,
as long as the requisites for adding a test are clearly documented
(as there are not obvious to all).

What I'd really like is to have the test logic in mainstream (not
the test artifacts). That way maintainers can "pass" their tests
when passing maintenance, or if one stop contributing, the tests
are still usable by anyone in the community.

Some closed-source binaries are available publicly, and we can
verify their hash.
Is it acceptable to add test + hash in mainstream, so any developer
in possession of such binaries is free to run the tests? There
should not be any licensing issue.

I would like to avoid "black box" devices we are afraid to modify
because very few people can test them.

Example of tests I'd like to add:

Thanks,

Phil.
