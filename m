Bisecting showed that this is the bad commit:

    b55f54bc965607c45b5010a107a792ba333ba654 exec: flush CPU TB cache in
breakpoint_invalidate

And I can indeed confirm that this commit is much slower than the
previous one, e18e5501d8ac692d32657a3e1ef545b14e72b730.

Title:
  Windows XP takes much longer to boot in TCG mode since 5.0

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Since upgrading from 4.2 to 5.0, a Windows XP VM takes much longer to
  boot.

  It hangs about three minutes on "welcome" screen with the blue
  background, while previously the total boot time was less than a
  minute.

  The issue only happens in TCG mode (not with KVM) and also happens
  with the current master which includes the uring patches (7d3660e7).

  I can reproduce this issue with a clean XP install with no flags other
  than `-m 2G`. After booting, the performance seems to be normal.
