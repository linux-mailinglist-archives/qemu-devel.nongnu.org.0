v1->v2:

  - removed patch on new git infrastructure section
  - added a patch that adds two files in Malta section

The goal of this series is to:

  * reduce the amount of "unmainatined" files (not having their
    maintainer in "MAINTAINERS")
  * reduce the amount of nominally maintained files, but unmaintained
    in reality
  * increase the role of non-mips open source participants in
    maintaining and reviewing mips content

I contacted most of the involved persons regarding these changes.
I am asking all to accept new roles, since really there seems to
be no better option than this. Please help QEMU maintainance, and
best wishes to all in future activities and enavours!

I am fine with Philippe and Herve sending direct pull requests from
coresponding areas to Peter.

Aleksandar Markovic (5):
  MAINTAINERS: Add a section on UI translation
  MAINTAINERS: Adjust maintainership for Fulong 2E board
  MAINTAINERS: Adjust maintainership for Malta board
  MAINTAINERS: Adjust maintainership for R4000 systems
  MAINTAINERS: Add two files to Malta section
