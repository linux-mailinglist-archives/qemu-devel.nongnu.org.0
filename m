I did not doubt that NFS does not support O_NOATIME, what I said was that I 
thought using O_NOATIME on NFS would return EPERM, but ...

... I tried this as well, and you are right, O_NOATIME is indeed simply 
*silently* dropped/ignored by NFS (i.e. without raising any error).

Good point!

That was my initial tendency yesterday, but your arguments now convinced me 
that the implied re-run, in the way your provided patch already does, is in 
this particular case the better choice.

Making that a configurable option would render this issue unnecessarily 
complicated and probably even contra productive for other users which might 
stumble over the same issue.

Just do me a favour: you already thoroughly explained the issue in the commit 
log, that's good, but please also add a short comment in code why the rerun is 
required, because it is not obvious by just reading the code. Finding that 
info from git log becomes tedious as soon as code is refactored there.

Aside of the missing comment in code:
