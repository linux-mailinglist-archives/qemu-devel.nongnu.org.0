Thanks for the answer,

indeed the second cluster of the board has been halted when I was
starting gdb the "normal" way - not adding the second inferior. In my
own research I did not find out about these inferiors, so I was
wondering why "info threads" did only show one cpu. Maybe gdb could
inform the user about unattached inferiors when using "info threads"
