In a very specific case, namely where the compressed size is larger than
the uncompressed size.  It would be a whole different story to only
compress the first write to a given cluster but not any following one.

I=E2=80=99m not sure whether that qualifies because the user is simply
responsible to ensure that the target is empty.

Otherwise, you could also argue that backup doesn=E2=80=99t necessarily cre=
ate a
real backup because with sync=3Dtop it won=E2=80=99t copy unallocated clust=
ers, so
if the target already has data in such a place, it won=E2=80=99t be overwri=
tten.

Furthermore I=E2=80=99d argue this would hardly be an accident.  Both
drive-backup with mode=3Dexisting and qemu-img convert -n are most likely
not used blindly but only when the situation requires it.

My point is that using compress=3Don can be an accident because people see
that option and think =E2=80=9CThat sounds useful!=E2=80=9D without reading=
 the warning.

I disagree that 1A is broken, and I disagree a generic option would not
be worse.  I still believe a simple generic option is prone to
accidental misuse.

Well, you say it isn=E2=80=99t needed.  I suppose if it were supported, peo=

would indeed use it.

First, it is not a simple boolean option.  This patch brings
implementation with it that converts writes to compressed writes and
sets a request alignment.  I actually think it=E2=80=99s better to do thing=
s
like that in a dedicated block driver than in the generic block layer code.

Second, we already this basically this for copy-on-read (which is also a
boolean option for -drive).

(FWIW, I=E2=80=99d prefer if detect-zeroes were a block driver instead of
generic block layer code.)

I don=E2=80=99t know whether the limitations can be captured in three words=
, but
it would at least make users pay closer attention to what the option is
really doing.

OTOH, the only downsides to a dedicated block driver to me appear that
it=E2=80=99s more cumbersome to use (which I actually consider a benefit) a=
nd
that it requires the usual filter driver boilerplate =E2=80=93 but that can=
 be
copied from other drivers[1].

(The benefits are that we don=E2=80=99t need to modify generic code and tha=
t
people need to read into the filter and its caveats before they can use it.=
)

[1] Actually, we could provide default implementations somewhere and
make block filters use them.  That should reduce the boilerplate size.
