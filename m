I'd agree, if removing nonsense would break VMBus detection (does it?).
if something is that doesn't make sense but has to stay because it is need
to make windows happy, that's fine , just add annotate is with comment,
so it won't confuse anyone why that code exists there later on.

I suggest to:
 1. try dropping _PS* & _STA as it doesn't actually does anything and _PS3 is plain wrong
 2. drop one IRQ, newer hyper-v seems to be doing fine with only one
 3. it's not ISA device, I'd suggest to move into _SB scope
 4. I don't know much about IRQs but
       git grep DEFINE_PROP_ | grep -i iqr
    yields nothing so I'm not sure if it's acceptable. Typically it's board that assigns
    IRQ and not device, for Sysbus devices (see: sysbus_init_irq/sysbus_connect_irq).
    So I'd leave it upto Paolo or someone else to decide/comment on.
