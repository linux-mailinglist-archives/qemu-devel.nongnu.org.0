There is no "version 2" of the "Lesser" General Public License. It is
either "GPL version 2.0" or "Lesser GPL version 2.1". This patch replaces all
occurrences of "Lesser GPL version 2" with "Lesser GPL version 2.1" in comment section.
Also, It came to notice that some of the files that were edited for the change
were not following latest comment rules. For example using "//" to mark comment
instead of "/*". That is also fixed in this patch.

This patch is divided in 5 parts, directory wise, in order to make reviewing process easier.
Below listed are the parts of the patch, where asterisk denotes the part you are currently viewing.

	[ ] Files in authz/backends/block/linux-user/tests/migration directory (82 Files)
	[ ] Files in hw/include/disas (100 files)
	[*] Files inside target/ 'alpha,arm,cris,hppa,i386' (96 files)
	[ ] Files inside target/ 'lm32,microblaze,mips,ppc,rx,sparc,tilegx,tricore,xtensa' (63 files)
	[ ] Files in ui/util/include/scripts and QEMU root directory (76 Files)

Below is how the license version was corrected:

1. To find the number of file having "Lesser GPL version 2 ":
	grep -l Lesser $(grep -rl "version 2 " * ) > result.dat
   Total of 417 files were found (After manually exluding the files like COPYING and COPYING.LIB from the result)

2. To find the number of occurences of "version 2 " in the resulted files:
	egrep -c "version 2 " $(cat result.dat)
   410 files had "version 2" occurence 1 time (name of those files was saved in one_timers.dat)
   and in 7 files "version 2" occurences were multiple times.

3. Files having occurence exactly 1 time were corrected using below command:
	sed -i "s/version 2 /version 2.1 /g" $(cat one_timers.dat)
   For rest of 7 files, correction was done manually.
