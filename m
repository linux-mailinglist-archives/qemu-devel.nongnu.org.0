Hm, actually, now that you mention bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter(),
quorum was the first driver to declare itself a filter, so strictly
speaking, if there is an inconsistency, it's the other uses that are
abusing the field...

Huh? This is just quoting the contract from your code?

Then that should probably be spelt out in the contract. Probably even
explicitly "NULL if there is either no filtered child or multiple
filtered children".

What do I have to look at to see whether something is an R/W filter or
not? qcow2 matches your criteria for an R/W filter. You say that it's
not useful, so it's not an R/W filter anyway. But where in the code
could I get this information?

This just doesn't make sense to me. If a driver matches the criteria for
an R/W filter, then it should be one. If qcow2 should not be considered
a R/W filter, then the criteria must be changed so that it isn't.

Hm - does this imply that .is_filter =3D=3D this is a R/W filter? Because
this was never spelt out, neither in code comments nor in commit
messages.

If we called R/W filters just "filters" (which makes it obvious how it
relates to .is_filter) and COW nodes something that doesn't include the
word "filter", things might become a lot clearer.

I was thinking per-child, actually, because you declare one BdrvChild
filtered and another not filtered.

But by now I think most of the confusion is really just a result of COW
being considered a filter in some respects (mainly just the names of the
child access functions), but not in others (like .is_filter).

What prevents a driver from being
(4) COW filter and R/W filter (e.g. qcow2 if it were useful)?

I mean, conceptually, not in the implementation.

I guess it boils down to me just not being able to get behind the
concept that COW is some sort of filter (especially when other things
like an external data file aren't).

Good. Or, well, good enough at least. ;-)

bdrv_filter_or_cow_child() is not a pretty name, but as long as we can't
think of anything that accurately covers both in a single word, it will
do the job...
