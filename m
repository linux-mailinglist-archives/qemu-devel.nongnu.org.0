  https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#choosing-a-versioning-scheme

Semver is the recommended approach, but they explicitly list date
based versioning as a valid alternative

  "Semantic versioning is not a suitable choice for all projects, 
   such as those with a regular time based release cadence and a 
   deprecation process that provides warnings for a number of 
   releases prior to removal of a feature."

That paragraph describes QEMU's scenario.

NB, historically we've made arbitrary changes to the python code
since it was not considered public API. If we make it official
public API, then we would actually need to start following our
deprecation process for the python code too.

I don't think it is that big a deal, and there is clear benefit to
having the python code version match the QEMU version that it is
the companioon to.

Ultimately the versioning scheme just impacts on the version string
conditionals people list for their dependancies. Apps consuming QEMU
can handle any of the version schemes without much difference.
