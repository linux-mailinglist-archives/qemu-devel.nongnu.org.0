Useful comment.

But looking at just the code (even without comments), this is safe - 
pre-patch, the only way to get to the out: label without a 'goto' is on 
the success path, at which point we can deduce that object_unref() is 
called exactly once whether on the success path or on the local_err 
path, at which point moving the label up and making the object_unref() 
unconditional is the same semantics.  With that hoisted, error_propagate 
is the only thing remaining under an 'if (local_err)' guard, and it is 
safe to call that when there is no error.  No semantic change, at which 
point all that remains to review is the accuracy of the comment.
