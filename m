That's an interesting idea, firmly relegating any "human friendly"
targetted CLI to a separate program, that in turn invokes this
low level QEMU binary. I do like the simplicity of this and the
strict division of the layers it provides us, as it will help keep
us honest when designing human friendly interfaces.

To be clear, I do think the QEMU project should be delivering a
nice simple human targetted interface, and ideally using the
'/usr/bin/qemu' binary name, and able to deliver users a machines
with a modern hardware config that can evolve over time.

Right, I'm not saying vl.c hasn't improved, but we're never going
to get out of the peculiar historical startup ordering rules we
have today by incremental fixes, without breaking people.
