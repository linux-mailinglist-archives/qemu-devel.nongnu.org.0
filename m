Sorry, I meant to say:

However, I don't think that several differences (in this series, I
think, altogether 7 lines) that would originate from difference of
names (QEMU vs. kernel) would be any significant obstacle for a
potential future attempts to do comparison QEMU checkpatch vs kernel
checkpatch.
