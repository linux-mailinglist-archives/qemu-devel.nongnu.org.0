Title:
  Compilation on MSYS2/MinGW-w64 fails with error: "No rule to make
  target capstone.lib"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I submitted this bug to Capstone directly but I figured it'd be useful
  to post it here too. The IS_MINGW check in the Makefile for Capstone
  fails under MSYS2 MinGW-w64 because cc --version doesn't have mingw in
  the output anymore:

  $ whereis cc
  cc: /mingw64/bin/cc.exe

  $ cc --version
  cc.exe (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 8.3.0

  Really simple patch:

  diff --git "a/Makefile" "b/Makefile"
  index 063f50db..1d9f042e 100644
