Requiring management application developers to figure out this possible
compatibility based on prod specs is really unrealistic. Product specs
are typically as clear as mud, and with the suggestion we consider
different rules for different types of devices, add up to a huge amount
of complexity. This isn't something app developers should have to spend
their time figuring out.

The suggestion that we make use of vendor proprietary helper components
is totally unacceptable. We need to be able to build a solution that
works with exclusively an open source software stack.

IMHO there needs to be a mechanism for the kernel to report via sysfs
what versions are supported on a given device. This puts the job of
reporting compatible versions directly under the responsibility of the
vendor who writes the kernel driver for it. They are the ones with the
best knowledge of the hardware they've built and the rules around its
compatibility.
