Right. We don't support reverse step/next/continue for remote targets. I 
think this would be the most appropriate way to implement this feature 
in GDB. But it is not trivial.

Checkpoints are an old mechanism for saving a snapshot from a process, 
but they don't support threaded inferiors and they need to be able to 
call fork.

That would be an easy and quick way to allow GDB to control things in 
QEMU, but I wouldn't say it is the best. Monitor commands are basically 
a bypass of the RSP where GDB sends/receives commands to/from the remote 
target.

GDB would need to be aware of such snapshots for them to be useful. 
Otherwise GDB wouldn't be able to use them to restore state.
