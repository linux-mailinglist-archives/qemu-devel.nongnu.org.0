You should know then that the korrekt way to write it would be:

itmap
is absolutely verboten!=E2=80=9C

Well, BDB is free.  That path has worked fine for BlockDriverStates.

I just thought people named their functions whatever they felt like at

HBitmaps are generally used to track dirty areas, so I=E2=80=99d find thi=
s a
misnomer.  BDBitmap would be OK.  The =E2=80=9Cblock=E2=80=9D part should=
 be in there
somewhere.
