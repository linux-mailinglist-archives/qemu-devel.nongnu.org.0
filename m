I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s any better to completely forbid it tha=
n to just
recommend in the spec that software should not set this field to zlib to
ensure backwards compatibility.

I see the point of forbidding it, but if I were to know nothing of qcow2
and read the spec, I guess I=E2=80=99d find it a bit weird to read =E2=80=
=9CIf this
field is not present, the compression type is zlib; if it is, it is not
zlib, but the specified value.=E2=80=9D  I=E2=80=99d ask myself why it is=
n=E2=80=99t simply =E2=80=9CThe
compression type is given by this field, it defaults to zlib.=E2=80=9D
