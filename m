If we make in-tree ./configure create a GNUmakefile shim that 
auto-forwards to build/, it would also be possible to create symlinks to 
the various targets that will live in build.  I recently switched my 
qemu playground to use VPATH builds, but with symlinks such as qemu-img 
-> build/qemu-img, I can still use my muscle memory of an in-tree build 
for normal development.

With symlinks, it is possible to give much more than 'make' the illusion 
of working in-tree.  It then boils down to a question of how many 
symlinks are worth creating.
