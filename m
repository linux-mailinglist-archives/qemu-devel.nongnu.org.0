34.5.1 Initial SMM Execution Environment
After saving the current context of the processor, the processor initialize=
s its core registers to the values shown in Table 34-4. Upon entering SMM, =
the PE and PG flags in control register CR0 are cleared, which places the p=
rocessor in an environment similar to real-address mode. The differences be=
tween the SMM execution environment and the real-address mode execution env=
ironment are as follows:
=E2=80=A2 The addressable address space ranges from 0 to FFFFFFFFH (4 GByte=
s).
=E2=80=A2 The normal 64-KByte segment limit for real-address mode is increa=
sed to 4 GBytes.
=E2=80=A2 The default operand and address sizes are set to 16 bits, which r=
estricts the addressable SMRAM address space to the 1-MByte real-address mo=
de limit for native real-address-mode code. However, operand-size and addre=
ss-size override prefixes can be used to access the address space beyond
                                         ^^^^^^^^
the 1-MByte.

we could map at 30000 not 64K required for save area but 128K and use
2nd half as secure RAM for stack and intermediate data.

Firmware could put there pre-calculated pointer to TSEG after it's configur=
ed and locked down,
this way relocation handler won't have to figure out TSEG address on its ow=
n.

It also could execute INIT reset, which leaves initialized SMM untouched
but otherwise CPU would be inactive.

Let me prepare a QEMU branch with something usable for you.

To avoid inventing mgmt API for configuring SMRAM at 30000,
I'm suggesting to steal/alias top or bottom 128K of TSEG window to 30000.
This way OVMF would be able to set SMI relocation handler modifying
TSEG and pass TSEG base/other data to it as well.
Would it work for you or should we try more elaborate approach?

in case of broadcast SMI (btw does OVMF use broadcast SMIs?) several CPUs c=
ould end up
with the same SMBASE within SMRAM
  1: default one: in case the 2nd CPU enters SMM after the 1st CPU saved ne=
w SMBASE but before it's called RSM
  2: duplicated SMBASE: where the 2nd CPU saves its new SMBASE before the 1=
st calls RSM

while the 2nd could be counteracted with using locks, I don't see how 1st o=
ne could be avoided.
May be host CPU can send 2nd SMI so just relocated CPU could send an ACK fr=
om relocated SMBASE/with new SMI handler?
