The abstraction serves several purposes.

First, it means that we don't need #ifdefs wrt GNUTLS in every piece of
QEMU code that involves TLS. They are isolated in the crypto/ code only.

Related to that, it means that anything that touches GNUTLS APIs directly
gets funnelled via the crypto maintainer for review.

It is easy to mis-use many of the GNUTLS APIs, and so the abstraction
serves to apply/enforce a more desirable usage policy on the rest of
the QEMU code, making it harder to screw up TLS.

Much of this is based on learning from libvirt code where the usage of
GNUTLS was not nearly so well encapsulated and increased burden.

Daniel
