I made the change; see gitlab commits or wait for v2 to see if it reads 
better to you.

We'll get to them in due time. For now, please admire the lipstick.

Secretly, asserts can be disabled in Python just like they can in C code.

My habit: if it's something that should already be true given the nature 
of how the code is laid out, use an assertion. If I am preventing an 
erroneous state (Especially from callers in other modules), explicitly 
raise an exception.

(See the gitlab branch for the updated version of this patch, which has 
changed the code slightly.)

increase and decrease it is.
