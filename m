Yes, exactly.  This is to work around the hang we are seeing when we
try to use these new VMs.

Good point, we will locate the log file there.

We were trying to follow the existing code, which is using latin1.
For example, console_wait() or console_consume() are using latin1.
However on further inspection we see that console_send() is using utf-8.
We will look at changing these latin1 cases to be utf-8.
I also found a case in get_qemu_version() we will change to utf-8 also.

I think that covers what we are trying to achieve here.
The logging to file is a nice to have, but
the draining of the output from QEMU is the main objective here.
We will do a bit more research here to seek out a cleaner way to achieve th=
is,
but certainly we would also be interested if any python experts have a
view on a cleaner approach.
