Re-adding qemu-devel - please don't take mailing list threads private.

The SPICE server library is linked directly to QEMU so g_printerr should
work fine from SPICE code in the same way as QEMU code.  If you're not
seeing the results, then my guess would be that the QEMU you are launching
is not actually using the SPICE library you built with debugging. It is
probably still using the SPICE library from the OS distro.
