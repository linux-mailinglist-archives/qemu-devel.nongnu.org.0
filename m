Note that due to a bug in the kernel handling of Mem_Enable
in the CXL Device DVSEC a fix is needed to sucessfully use these
patches with Linux.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cxl/CAPcyv4gFWw9s6r9kUoL-_P9qnaZSJBMz+EcmfY+0g1NHrJQx7Q@mail.gmail.com/T/#t

Note the issue was detected using this emulation.

Changes since v9:

Thanks to Tong Zhang and Markus Armbruster for review of v9.
- Fixed return of all 1s on HDM decoder not matching.
- Off by one error in an assert for register writes.
- Write masks for both PCI config space structures and
  registers in MMIO space. These were partly queued up
  for a future patch set, but after review comment from
  Tong, I decided it was best to put these in place from
  the start.  Note I was a bit undecided on whether to drop
  review tags for this (it's quit a bit of code, but very
  simple).  Alex, and Adam if you want to take another look
  at patch 2 in particular that would be great. 
- Tag from Markus added.
- Fix for wrong setting of Mem_Enable as described in the
  thread linked above.

The series can be applied in parts if that makes sense:

Possible partial sets:
1-15 (end with the test of the pxb-cxl host bridge)
16-22 (end with the test for root port and type3 device)
23-39 (end with tests on x86 pc for CFMWS including BIOS table updates)
40-41 (arm64 virt support + simple test case)
42 (documentation - we could pull this forwards to before the arm support)
43-45 (switch support)

gitlab tree at gitlab.com/jic23/qemu cxl-v10-draft-2

As before that tree has additional patches on top that will form
part of future postings. This time it has SPDM support via
a socket connection to DMTF/spdm_emu / libspdm. I'll send an RFC
on that topic as it's a discussion that can go on in parallel.

Several people have asked about contributing additional features.
As those come in I'll apply them on top of this series and handle
rebases etc as necessary whilst we seek to get this first set
of patches upstream.

Updated background info:

Looking in particular for:
* Review of the PCI interactions
* x86 and ARM machine interactions (particularly the memory maps)
* Review of the interleaving approach - is the basic idea
  acceptable?
* Review of the command line interface.
* CXL related review welcome but much of that got reviewed
  in earlier versions and hasn't changed substantially.

TODOs:

* Volatile memory devices (easy but it's more code so left for now).
* Hotplug?  May not need much but it's not tested yet!
* More tests and tighter verification that values written to hardware
  are actually valid - stuff that real hardware would check.
* Testing, testing and more testing.  I have been running a basic
  set of ARM and x86 tests on this, but there is always room for
  more tests and greater automation.
* CFMWS flags as requested by Ben.
* Parititioning support - ability to change the balance of volatile
  and non volatile memory on demand.
* Trace points as suggested my Mark to help with debugging memory
  interleaving setup.

Why do we want QEMU emulation of CXL?

As Ben stated in V3, QEMU support has been critical to getting OS
software written given lack of availability of hardware supporting the
latest CXL features (coupled with very high demand for support being
ready in a timely fashion). What has become clear since Ben's v3
is that situation is a continuous one. Whilst we can't talk about
them yet, CXL 3.0 features and OS support have been prototyped on
top of this support and a lot of the ongoing kernel work is being
tested against these patches. The kernel CXL mocking code allows
some forms of testing, but QEMU provides a more versatile and
extensible platform.

Other features on the qemu-list that build on these include PCI-DOE
/CDAT support from the Avery Design team further showing how this
code is useful. Whilst not directly related this is also the test
platform for work on PCI IDE/CMA + related DMTF SPDM as CXL both
utilizes and extends those technologies and is likely to be an early
adopter.
Refs:
CMA Kernel: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210804161839.3492053-1-Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com/
CMA Qemu: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1624665723-5169-1-git-send-email-cbrowy@avery-design.com/
DOE Qemu: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/1623329999-15662-1-git-send-email-cbrowy@avery-design.com/

As can be seen there is non trivial interaction with other areas of
Qemu, particularly PCI and keeping this set up to date is proving
a burden we'd rather do without :)

Ben mentioned a few other good reasons in v3:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210202005948.241655-1-ben.widawsky@intel.com/

What we have here is about what you need for it to be useful for testing
currently kernel code.  Note the kernel code is moving fast so
since v4, some features have been introduced we don't yet support in
QEMU (e.g. use of the PCIe serial number extended capability).

All comments welcome.

Additional info that was here in v5 is now in the documentation patch.

Thanks,

Jonathan
