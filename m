If I'm interpreting your reply & the quoted text orrectly, the version
string isn't really a version string in any normal sense of the word
"version".

Instead it sounds like string encoding a set of features in some arbitrary
vendor specific format, which they parse and do compatibility checks on
individual pieces ? One or more parts may contain a version number, but
its much more than just a version.

If that's correct, then I'd prefer we didn't call it a version string,
instead call it a "capability string" to make it clear it is expressing
a much more general concept, but...

..even if the huge amount of flexibility is technically relevant from the
POV of the hardware/drivers, we should consider whether management apps
actually want, or can use, that level of flexibility.

The task of picking which host to place a VM on has alot of factors to
consider, and when there are a large number of hosts, the total amount
of information to check gets correspondingly large.  The placement
process is also fairly performance critical.

Running complex algorithmic logic to check compatibility of devices
based on a arbitrary set of rules is likely to be a performance
challenge. A flat list of supported strings is a much simpler
thing to check as it reduces down to a simple set membership test.

IOW, even if there's some complex set of device type / vendor specific
rules to check for compatibility, I fear apps will ignore them and
just define a very simplified list of compatible string, and ignore
all the extra flexibility.

I'm sure OpenStack maintainers can speak to this more, as they've put
alot of work into their scheduling engine to optimize the way it places
VMs largely driven from simple structured data reported from hosts.

Daniel
