We say that we need to own the iothread mutex for any reset, so global
should be ok. Thought, I just checked, it's only mentioned in the
documentation not in the header file. I should probably add a comment
there too along with the link to the documentation file.

If we want to drop the iothread mutex constraint. I think we need to
carefully check there is no hidden problem. In particular in hold and
exit phases we allow to have external effects like setting gpios and we
have no way to control what it provokes.

You're right it is just for assert: to avoid any miss-use of the api
which could lead to being in bad reset state. So we can indeed drop it.

It refers to the assert(type == RESET_TYPE_COLD).
I added theses because we cannot just add items in the enum to have
working multiple reset types.
A comment like this will be more clear:
/*
 * TODO: Additional reset types need support in phases handling
 * functions (resettable_phase_enter/hold/exit()) before allowing more
 * enum entries. Remove the following assert when it is done.
 */

I'll do that and fix all the typos

Thanks for the review,
