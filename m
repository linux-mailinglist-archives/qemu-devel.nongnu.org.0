I'm not sure. Of course I'd need to experiment with it to be sure, but
I'm reluctant to go through that exercise, because I believe that a
deferred validation will result in less specific errors messages. For
example, how would the validator know in which order the sve<N> properties
were provided? Which is necessary to complain that one length is not
allowed when another has already been disabled, or vice versa.

Also with deferred validation I think I'd need more vq states, at least
for when KVM is enabled. For example, if 384-bit vector lengths are not
supported on the KVM host, but the user does sve384=on, and all we do
is record that, then we've lost the KVM unsupported information and won't
find out until we attempt to enable it later at kvm vcpu init time. We'd
need a kvm-unsupported-user-enabled state to track that, which also means
we're not blindly recording user input in cpu_arm_set_sve_vq() anymore,
but are instead applying logic to decide which state we transition to.

Thanks,
drew
