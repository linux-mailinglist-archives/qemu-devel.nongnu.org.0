Alex corrected me on IRC, qtest is irrelevant here.
The problem is he disables the timer twice.

So maybe something like:

 static void npcm7xx_timer_pause(NPCM7xxTimer *t)
 {
     int64_t now;

+    if (!timer_pending(&t->qtimer)) {
+        return;
+    }
     timer_del(&t->qtimer);
     now = qemu_clock_get_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL);
     t->remaining_ns = t->expires_ns - now;
     g_assert(t->remaining_ns > 0);
 }
