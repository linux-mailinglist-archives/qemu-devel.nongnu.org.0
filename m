Hello, Peter.
For this implemenation rt=5Fsigqueueinfo()/rt=5Ftgsigqueueinfo() were u=
sed to multiplex signals that are out of the host range. This enabled t=
he use of a wider signal range with rt=5Fsigqueueinfo(), rt=5Ftgsigqueu=
einfo(), as well as kill() (for pid > 0) and tgkill(). A process can no=
w use these system calls to send a range of signals which weren't suppo=
reted before to itself or others threads or processes.

The tkill() system call and kill() with the argument pid <=3D 0 couldn'=
t be implemented simply using this method because it requires acquiring=
 information about, and sending simultaneous signals to multiple thread=
s or processes and these functionalities are out of the scope of rt=5Fs=
igqueueinfo()/rt=5Ftgsigqueueinfo().

This patch set was primarily focused on expanding the range of real-tim=
e signals and making them usable but some limitations still remain. For=
 example, the priority of those real-time signals, as defined by POSIX,=
 doesn't depend on the actual signal number but on the host signal nube=
r which is used for multiplexing.
As it now is, the functionaly is only enabled for signals that are high=
er-numbered then the host signals but I don't see a conceptual problem =
in expanding and testing the implenentation to include other signals (e=
.g. the signals that NPTL uses).

Regards,
Milo=C5=A1
