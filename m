Nothing a helper function can't solve IMHO, I would convert this to a num=
ber,
and then check bitwise the bit 2, assuming that is the dirty bit)
Again, note that my approach to code is to make it as easy as possible fo=
r the
next guy to change, so I am noticing such places. Eventually someone of u=
s,
will be that next guy. Then again, I don't mind leaving this as is, just =
noting this.

I guess so, won't argue about this one.
