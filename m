Hm, I see. The next best thing would then probably having a bool in
BlockDriver that enables the fallback.

Because we can't actually truncate there. We can only do the fake thing
and claim we have truncated even though the size didn't change.

But actually, while avoiding the fake truncate outside of image creation
would avoid confusing situations where the user requested image
shrinking, gets success, but nothing happened, it would also break
actual resizes where the volume is resized externally and block_resize
is only called to notify qemu to pick up the size change.

So after all, we probably do need to keep the hack in bdrv_co_truncate()
instead of moving it to image creation only.
