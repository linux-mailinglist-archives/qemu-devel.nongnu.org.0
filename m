I'v been wondering about this during the week-end. If this is=20
problematic to add the tests in the QEMU repository, we can add the=20
tests in another repository. The problem will be to keep it sync with=20
QEMU. If we add it as a QEMU submodule, it is the same as continuing=20
adding the tests in the main tree.

Avocado don't have problem browsing tests in various directories, the=20
problem is we need to import avocado_qemu=20
(tests/acceptance/avocado_qemu) which imports QEMUMachine from qemu.machi=
ne.

Cleber, we once talked about having the main repository producing=20
python-qemu and python-qemu-acceptance-testing packages. How do you want=20
to proceed? Extract theses files from the main repo and have it consumes=20
the packages? I'm afraid that doesn't scale properly with distributions.
Also, updating them to improve the testing will be slow/painful.

I now realize this is probably not the clever path to continue, but I'm=20
currently out of ideas to unblock the testing process.

Peter what do you think, do you think of other alternatives we can=20
investigate?

Thanks,

Phil.
