That's because the maintenance interrupt is only used in KVM to trigger
an exit if nothing else causes one, and we end-up suppressing the cause
of the maintenance interrupt (by turning the VGIC off) before actually
coming to a point where we'd handle it.

The lack of MI would at worse delay the injection of new virtual 
interrupts,
not something you'd notice unless you start looking very closely at the
delivery latency.

Thanks,

         M.
