Thank you for the write up Peter!

My first reaction to the 'hole' idea was that it's rather redundant and
sticking to the current concept where 'everything missing is a hole' is
sufficient. I, however, didn't think about dirty bitmap at all so maybe
it is worth considering.

As an in-KVM solution to the problem I could suggest an enhanced version
of KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION taking multiple regions (or even the whole
memmap for the guest) and we would process it in one shot. We can either
do it in an incremental form (add this, remove that) or require to
supply the full set so KVM will start with dropping everything. We can
also exploit Paolo's idea and make the call return dirty bitmaps of the
removed slots, however, this complicates things from both API (like if I
want to remove two slots and add three -- where would the dirty bitmap
go?) and QEMU PoV (as we don't necessarily want to consume dirty bitmap
when we do the update). So I'd stick with the 'incremental' idea.

Honestly, I'm not fully convinced we need an in-KVM idea. We'll still
have to kick all vCPUs out to do the update (for shorter period compared
to in-QEMU solution but still) so in case we are concerned about e.g. RT
workloads we should be as I don't see a way out: latency spikes are
inevitable.
