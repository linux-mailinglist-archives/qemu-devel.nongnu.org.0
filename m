That is a bit overboard, no?

All I'm asking for is:

  (a) A header field telling what kind of payload has been sent,
      for both requests and replies.
  (b) A header field telling what size the payload has.

That hardly is a different level of complexity.  And that isn't up for
negotiation.

If you absolutely don't want ack all requests, ok.  Not sending a reply
in case there is no payload to send back and no error to report is
something I can live with.

May I suggest QMP instead?

Seriously:  If you want reuse something, just use the vhost-user wire
format.  Which is essentially what I'm asking for, plus an additional
flags field in the header.

cheers,
