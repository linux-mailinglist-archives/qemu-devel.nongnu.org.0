Ah OK, so it's not really about blocking it completely; just delaying it
a bit; in that case add_blocker is the wrong thing.

Maybe the right thing is to do something just like
MIGRATION_STATUS_WAIT_UNPLUG, it's right near the start of the thread.
Again it's job is just to make the migration wait while it does some
