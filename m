I wonder if a tests/ subdirectory instead of the -test suffix would
organise things a bit better.

Occasionally they were useful when something went wrong during the test
run and I only wanted to repeat the part after it happened. But it's a
rare case and we don't have a clear order any more with arbitrary test
names (which are an improvement otherwise), so we'll live with it.

Maybe mention here that the file can be executed standalone, even if
it'S not used by check yet.

A little bit of bikeshedding: As this can be executed as a standalone
tool, would a name like findtests.py be better?

We have more groups than just these. We could either try and document
all of them here, or we could only keep auto/quick/disabled which have a
general meaning rather than defining an area of code that they test. If
we do the latter, I would clarify that this is not an exhaustive list,
and remove "img" from this section.

As this is a new code file, would you mind adding type hints from the
start?

You're using f strings in the later patches. Wouldn't it be more
consistent to use them here, too?

I think unhandled options shouldn't be considered an error and we
shouldn't even try to find and display any tests then. I'd either print
the help text or have an error message that refers to --help.
