I don't see how this is sensible. QMP commands are something that I
reuse even less than VM configurations, so creating a one-off file for
each would take me a lot more time and I would still have to type the
same JSON code that I have to type with -qmp stdio.

The reason it is and should be an interactive shell is that I'm
interacting with it. Switching back and forth between a text editor and
a shell to actually send the command to QEMU would make things only even
more cumbersome than they already are.

If I wanted to program a QMP client, I would use Python. For me,
conditionals and loops are completely out of scope for a QMP shell. I
just want an easy way to tell QEMU to do something specific.

A command history already exists for qmp-shell. It's better than bash
because it doesn't mix QMP history with whatever else I do on my
computer.

Autocomplete in qmp-shell doesn't exist, as far as I know, but if
implemented, it could be a lot more useful than bash completion because
it could offer key completion based on the QMP schema.

This is in fact a big part of the problem that qmp-shell really needs to
solve before it can replace HMP: How to make writing commands at least
almost as simple as with HMP. If I can just press tab a few times to
cycle through the available options for the command, that would already
be a massive improvement over writing JSON manually (which you would
still have to do with your text-file based approach, without any
QMP-specific support).

The other part that it needs to solve is how to be available by default
without specifying anything on the command line. Basically, if I press
Ctrl-Alt-2, I want to get to a monitor shell. If that shell is
implemented internally or by an external Python process, I don't mind.

Speed would be the least of my concerns. This is about manual use, and
it already takes me a while to type in my commands.

Just to compare, this is what the human user oriented flow looks like
today:

1. qemu-system-x86_64 -M pc-q35-5.0 -drive if=3Dvirtio,... -cdrom ...

2. <Press Ctrl-Alt-2 to get to the HMP shell>
   (qemu) drive_add ...
   <Press Ctrl-Alt-1 to get back to the guest>

3. <Press Ctrl-Alt-2 to get to the HMP shell>
   (qemu) device_del ...
   <Press Ctrl-Alt-1 to get back to the guest>

This is what we're competing with, and honestly I don't see how your
qemu-runtime-*/qemu-client based flow comes even close to it in terms of
usability.

QMP, JSON and YAML may be nice machine interfaces, but having nice
machine interfaces doesn't mean that you shouldn't also have something
that is suitable for humans. qmp-shell is trying to be that, and while
it leaves much to be desired in its current state, replacing it with
even more machine-friendly stuff that is cumbersome for humans isn't the
right answer.
