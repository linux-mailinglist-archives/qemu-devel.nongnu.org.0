Title:
  test-char fails if host has no network interfaces

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  # ./tests/test-char =

  Unexpected error in inet_parse_connect_saddr() at util/qemu-sockets.c:421:
  # =

  # address resolution failed for 127.0.0.1:42275: Name or service not known
  # =


  Aborted (core dumped)

  # ip a
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group=
 default qlen 1000
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

      inet6 ::1/128 scope host =

         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

  =

  This seems to be related to use of AI_ADDRCONFIG in qemu-sockets.c inet_p=
arse_connect_saddr, dropping it fixes the test. 'man getaddrinfo' makes it =
sound like AI_ADDRCONFIG requires the host to have a non-loopback ipv4 or i=
pv6 address available

  This host setup may seem niche, but it is what the 'mock' RPM build
  tool has by default. In Fedora we run the test suite during the RPM
  build, so the failing test causes a bit of pain for certain workflows
