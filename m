Hey Stefan,

Sorry it=E2=80=99s not clear. but these files are referenced in =
Makefile.target.

These stub functions are only used by the remote process, and not by
QEMU itself.

Our goal is to ensure that the remote process is building the smallest
set of files necessary and these stub functions are necessary to meet
that goal.

For example, the remote process needs to build some of the functions
defined in =E2=80=9Chw/core/qdev-properties-system.c=E2=80=9D. However, =
this file
depends on audio.c (references audio_state_by_name()), which is not
needed for the remote process. The alternative to stub functions would
be to compile audio.c into the remote process, but that was not =
necessary
in our judgement. When the project started out, we spent a lot of time
figuring out which functions/files are necessary for the remote process, =
and
we stubbed out the ones which are needed to resolve dependency during
compilation, but not needed for functionality.

audio.c is just an example of tens of other places where we needed to
make similar judgements.

Would you prefer if we moved these stub functions into a separate
library (instead of stub-obj-y) which is only linked by the remote =
process?
