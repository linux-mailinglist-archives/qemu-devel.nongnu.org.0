Honestly I forgot the story why we filtered out these features upon
eVMCS enablement in KVM. As there are no corresponding eVMCS fields,
there's no way a guest can actually use them.

I'm going to check that nothing breaks if we remove the filter. I'll go
and test Hyper-V 2016 and 2019.

This is not required when enabling eVMCS on a genuine Hyper-V because it
correctly filters out unsupported features, however, to not break
KVM-on-KVM-using-eVMCS case we'll have to move the filter from host to
guest.

Thanks!
