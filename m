readdir_many() is written intended as general purpose directory retrieval 
function, that is for other purposes in future in mind, yes.

What I don't do is adding code which is not explicitly needed right now of 
course. That would not make sense and would make code unnecessarily bloated 
and of course too complicated (e.g. readdir_many() is currently simply 
directly calling v9fs_readdir_response_size() to decide whether to terminate 
the loop instead of taking some complicated general-purpose loop end 
"predicate" structure or callback as function argument).

But when it comes to the structure of the code that I have to add NOW, then I 
indeed take potential future changes into account, yes! And this applies 
specifically to the two changes you requested here inside readdir_many(). 
Because I already know, I would need to revert those 2 changes that you 
requested later on. And I don't see any issue whatsover retaining the current 
version concerning those 2.

Best regards,
Christian Schoenebeck
