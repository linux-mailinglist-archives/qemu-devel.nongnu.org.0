Lame.

Okay for us as long as the pointer chasing stays off the hot paths.  But
that's not obvious.

Peter challenged this idea.

Also lame.  I figure code adaption will involve pointer chasing.  Again,
beware of hot paths.  This one feels less likely to be a problem,
though.

Never understood our need for them for longer than half a day after
getting it explained to me.  I guess that's my fault.  Anyway, the less
we use them, the better.

Hacks exploiting deprecated GObject features would be a bad idea.
Perhaps we can hack something up that doesn't.

I hated them from day one, tried to kill them, lost the argument.

Hard or not?

What to do?

Our naming rules and conventions are weakly documented.

So most QOM properties would be based on a GObject property, but some
wouldn't be, correct?

Yes.
