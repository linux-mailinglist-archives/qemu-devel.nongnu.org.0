It is I think supposed to be an SD card. The modelling
may well be odd -- it's a qomification of a pre-existing
abstraction layer that predates QOM and qbus.

I suspect this is because the requirement to change SD
card contents existed and was implemented via changing
the block backend before the concept of a hot-pluggable
QOM object even existed. So now we have something we
wish to maintain back-compat for (in terms of monitor
commands to change/eject doing what they've always done),
some SD controllers which haven't been entirely QOMified
(I see Philippe just posted a series to do that cleanup,
which is great), and some parts of the code which have been
updated but by people (ie me) who understand the QOM parts
of things but don't have any understanding of the operations
the block layer provides and so converted the device/SD code's
API to the rest of QEMU but left its interaction with the block
layer using the same APIs that the pre-QOM code used.

The thing at the other end of the TYPE_SD_BUS is the SD controller
(ie the bit of hardware which presents a registers-and-interrupts
interface to the system on one end and has an SD card slot on the
other end). The link between them has operations like "do command",
"read data", "write data", "get readonly status", which are abstractions
of the h/w operations on the pins between an SD controller
and the SD card. It also has an operation for "tell the controller
I'm actually an inserted card". So the "sd-card" device implements
the logic that in real h/w really is inside the microcontroller
on the SD card (and so is identical for all SD cards regardless
of machine type), and the sd controller device implements the logic
that's in the sd controller chip in the machine proper (which
can vary a lot between machines, from very-simple "software
does all the work and the controller just waves the wires up and
down" to much more sophisticated setups).
