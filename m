There's VM snapshotting as well where things are not as simple. Host reboot is a bit of a challenge when your TPM 2 emulator doesn't support permanent AND volatile state marshalling and unmarshalling. Upgrading the reference model has also been a challenge in the past where it couldn't read old state anymore when new pieces were added to the state. These were areas where efforts went into libtpms for example. This is not to say that everything is perfect with libtpms and swptm since they have thier own challenges but they have at least resolved some of the issues.

We already have a working TPM 2 emulator that does support VM suspend/resume/snapshotting and migration. If you want to become maintainer of your backend model and everything associated with it, please add yourself to the MAINTAINERS list.
