KVM Forum 2023
June 14-15, 2023
Brno, Czech Republic
https://kvm-forum.qemu.org/
###########################

KVM Forum is an annual event that presents a rare opportunity for 
developers and users to discuss the state of Linux virtualization 
technology and plan for the challenges ahead. Sessions include updates 
on the state of the KVM virtualization stack, planning for the future, 
and many opportunities for attendees to collaborate.

This year's event will be held in Brno, Czech Republic on June 14-15, 
2023.  It will be in-person only and will be held right before the 
DevConf.CZ open source community conference.

June 14 will be at least partly dedicated to a hackathon or "day of 
BoFs". This will provide time for people to get together and discuss 
strategic decisions, as well as other topics that are best solved within 
smaller groups.
