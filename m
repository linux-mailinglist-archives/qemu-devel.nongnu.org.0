User namespaces has always been a one TODO item. Few challenges are
how to manage uid/gid mapping for existing directories which will be
shared. We will have to pick a mapping range and then chown the
files accordingly. And chowning itself will require priviliges.

Now Stefan is adding support to run virtiofsd inside container. So
podman should be able virtiofsd inside a user namespace (And even
give CAP_SYS_ADMIN). That way we don't have to worry about setting
a user namespace and select a mapping etc. But persistent data
volumes will continue to be an issue with user namespace, right?

How are you dealing with it in podman. Containers running in 
user namespace and with volume mounts.
