Public bug reported:

While running the acceptance tests on s390x, the arm tests under
qemu/tests/acceptance/boot_linux_console.py will timeout, except the
test using u-boot. All the arm tests run without problems on x86 and
ppc.

This test boots the kernel and wait for a kernel panic to make sure it
can boot that kind of kernel on the host running the test. The URL for
the kernels are available inside the python test code, but I'm listing
them here:

s/fa030bd77a014a0b8e360d3b7011df89283a2f0b/spi.bin

I tried to manually investigate the problem with the first kernel of the
list. The command I used to try to boot it was:

/home/linux1/src/v4.2.0-rc3/bin/qemu-system-arm -serial stdio -machine virt=
 -kernel /home/linux1/venv/python3/data/cache/by_location/1d5fdf8018e79b806=
aa982600c0866b199946efc/vmlinuz
-append "printk.time=3D0 console=3DttyAMA0"

On an x86 machine, I can see it boots and ends with a kernel panic as
expected. On s390x, it just hangs.

I also tried to debug with gdb, redirecting the monitor and the serial
console to other terminal sessions without success.

QEMU version is the latest as of today,tag v4.2.0-rc4, commit
1bdc319ab5d289ce6b822e06fb2b13666fd9278e.

s390x system is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.7 running as a z/VM
6.4.0 guest at IBM LinuxONE Community Cloud.

x86 system is a Fedora 31 running on Intel i7-8650U.
