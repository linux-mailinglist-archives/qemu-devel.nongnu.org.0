hi Alex
could you help clarify whether my understandings below are right?
In future,
1. for mdev and for passthrough device withoug hardware ability to track
dirty pages, the vendor driver has to explicitly call
vfio_pin_pages()/vfio_unpin_pages() + a flag to tell vfio its dirty page set.

2. for those devices with hardware ability to track dirty pages, will still
provide a callback to vendor driver to get dirty pages. (as for those devices,
it is hard to explicitly call vfio_pin_pages()/vfio_unpin_pages())

3. for devices relying on dirty bit info in physical IOMMU, there
will be a callback to physical IOMMU driver to get dirty page set from
vfio.
