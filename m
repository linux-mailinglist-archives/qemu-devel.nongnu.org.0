Correct.  A common member (whether it's local or from the base) is in
SchemaInfoObject.members[].  Moving it to all the variants moves it to
the variant types' .members[].

QMP's backward compatibility promise does not include "introspection
value won't change".  Still, such changes can conceivably confuse
clients.  Care is advisable.  But it's not a hard "no".
