It might be helpful to add here the concrete details of how to do that,
so people don't have to look up what an incomplete type is:

"That is, you should define the 'typedef struct SomethingIf SomethingIf'
so that you can pass around 'SomethingIf *si' arguments, but not define
a 'struct SomethingIf { ... }'. The only things you can validly do with
a 'SomethingIf *' are to pass it as an argument to a method on its correspo=
nding
SomethingIfClass, or to dynamically cast the interface pointer to a pointer
to the concrete object which is implementing the interface."

?

...though that last part is then kind of awkwardly similar to this sentence=
.
There's probably better wording possible than what I suggest above.
