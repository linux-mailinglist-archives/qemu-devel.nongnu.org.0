I though it could be useful to warn the users when QEMU had to fix up some 
values to notify them that what they get may not be what they expect and 
can then know why. If the message really annoys you you can remove it but 
I think it can be useful. I just think your real problem with it is that 
Error can't support it so it's easier to remove the warning than fixing 
Error or use warn_report instead.

The memory size that triggers the warning is specified by the user so the 
user can do someting about it.

I agree with that and also hate Windows's habit of trying to be more 
intelligent than the user and prefer the Unix way however the average 
users of QEMU (from my perpective, who wants to run Amiga like OSes 
typically on Windows and for the most part not knowing what they are 
doing) are already intimidated by the messy QEMU command line interface 
and will specify random values and complain or go away if it does not work 
so making their life a little easier is not useless. These users (or any 
CLI users) are apparently not relevant from your point of view but they do 
exist and I think should be supported better.

What was broken in this patch? Isn't freeing the previous warning when 
adding a new one or combining them as you say below (although I don't 
really get what you mean) would fix it without removing fix ups? It's only 
unused now because in previous patches you've removed all usages: first 
broke memory fixup because of some internal QEMU API did not support 
fixing up memory size so instead of fixing that API removed what did not 
fit, then now removing type fix ups because it's not fitting Error API.

Originally it did work well and produced usable values for whatever number 
the user specified and it was convenient for users. (Especially the 
sam460ex is a problematic case because of SoC and firmware limits that the 
user should not need to know about.)

I've tried to use error so the board code can decide what's an error and 
what's a warning but if this cannot be done with this QEMU facility I 
don't know a better way than using warn_report for warnings.
