qemu/libvirt is not the only client of NBD.  In fact, the nbdkit and 
libnbd projects exist to make it easier to utilize NBD from more places.

This is a non-argument.  When configured correctly at the NBD server, 
the NBD_OPT_STARTTLS option is the _only_ option accepted by a client, 
at which point you are right back into TLS code (from gnutls or 
elsewhere) and using the existing TLS libraries to establish the 
connection - but that is the SAME thing you would have to do even if 
there were a way to connect to an NBD server that doesn't even start 
with plaintext handshaking.

If you are going to make a change in this area, it will need to be 
agreed on in the upstream NBD list, where _all_ implementations of NBD 
(both client and server) can weigh in; qemu will not change in a vacuum 
without upstream protocol concurrence.

It is very easy to write both servers and clients that require a 
transition from plaintext into TLS before any serious traffic is sent.
