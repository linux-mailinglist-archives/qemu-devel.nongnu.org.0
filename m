I see.  I didn't consider that.

One advantage of my manual fixing is a clearer record of the flaws in
git.  It should also keep your work simpler, which is always a good idea
for massive, mechanical patches.

I went for the minimal fix.

I believe returning something useful is better.  It also matches the
GError conventions.  Deviating from them in this point was a mistake.

Touching up functions to return something useful by hand is a lot of
work, though: functions have many returns, and we have many functions in
need of this touch-up.  Some clever Coccinellery might be able to pull
it off.  I haven't tried.

However, your clever "auto propagation" Coccinellery makes such a change
less compelling, because it hides the propagation.

Thanks!
