Paolo motived me to salvage this (other!) previous series fromi
Samuel Ortiz (NEMU project).

v1 cover from Samuel [1]:

  This patchset allows for building and running ARM targets with TCG
  disabled. It splits the target/arm/helper.c file into logical TCG and
  non TCG dependent files so that one can build and run QEMU binaries wit=
h
  or without TCG enabled.

  The rationale behind this work comes from the NEMU project where we're
  trying to only support x86 and ARM 64-bit architectures, without
  including the TCG code base. We can only do so if we can build and run
  ARM binaries with TCG disabled.

v2:

Most of the patches from v1 got adapted, except the "Move all
interrupt handlers" patch, because Peter disagreed with it.
See threads:
 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-11/msg03908.html
 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg07304.html
Anyway this is not a blocking issue, and can be done once this series
get merged.

This is a kind of series you don't want to rebase (as in, the quicker
it get merged, the saner). It is also one of my most painful QEMU
series, and really wish it was worthwhile.

The diffstat is pretty decent.

Regards,

Phil.
