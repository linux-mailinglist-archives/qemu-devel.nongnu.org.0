I suspect it's about sharing that memory in a discoverable way. Maybe it 
is also about the signalling channel defined in the device.

OTOH, when it's really about sharing everything, even bidirectional, 
that rather looks like a pragmatic shortcut, not a generic model.

The patches should clarify their use case a bit further, I think. The 
title suggests a generic sharing solution, but my impression is that it 
rather caters a specific case under specific boundary conditions.
