In the ieee6 test case it is attempting to write OFE, bit [10] which:

    This bit is RW only if the implementation supports the trapping of
floating-point exceptions. In an implementation that does not support
floating-point exception trapping, this bit is RAZ/WI.

    When this bit is RW, it applies only to floating-point operations.
Advanced SIMD operations always use untrapped floating-point exception
handling in AArch32 state

This might be a broken test.

Title:
  Regressions on arm-linux-gnueabihf target with some GCC tests

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  Hi,

  After trying qemu master:
  commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
  Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
  Author: Peter Maydell <email address hidden>
  Date: Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

  even with the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1834496,
  I've noticed several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GC=
C testsuite.
  I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed s=
hared libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

  All tests used to pass w/o error, but with a recent qemu, all of them
  make qemu crash.

  This was noticed with GCC master configured with
  --target arm-none-linux-gnueabihf
  --with-cpu cortex-a57
  --with-fpu crypto-neon-fp-armv8

  Thanks
