We don't really need to use a union.  I should probably change that.  I think
AJB had the same question vs one of the previous revisions.

We know they're not used at the same time because bank_fieldoffsets is only
used *before* the structure is duplicated and added into the hash table
(overwriting .fieldoffset depending on the bank as they are duplicated), and
orig_{read,write}fn are only used *after* the structure has been added to the
hash table.

When there is no .writefn, we use raw_write, which uses fieldoffset.
