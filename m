not necessarily, even if it's pain to check for earliest spec where
feature appeared, it's the best and the least ambiguos comment format to
refference spec, i.e. (do not count on chapter/table numbering/naming being
stable accross versions)

/* Spec name + ver: chapter/table where the feature is described */

something like:

/* ACPI 1.0b: 16.2.5.4 Type 2 Opcodes Encoding: DefObjectType */                 
Aml *aml_object_type(Aml *object)

all versions are at (starting from 1.0)
https://uefi.org/acpi/specs

so far that worked well, effect of requiring spec+version was less
questions during review as reviewer doesn't have to guess where
it's documented.
