Intented use of -compat deprecated-input=3Derror,deprecated-output=3Dhide i=
s
"testing the future": make QEMU behave as if the deprecated features
were already gone.  Can be useful when you want to test code that deals
with the anticipated future *now*.

It can also be used to ferret out unknown uses of deprecated interfaces:
run test suite with it, see what fails.  But as you note, the
deprecated-output=3Dhide part is somewhat problematic in that role.

QEMU already reports its events via introspection.  What's missing is an
event subscription mechanism.  Should be feasible.

Additional benefit: can reduce I/O.

If deprecated-input=3Derror makes subscribing to a deprecated event fail,
we don't need deprecated-output=3Dhide for events.

But events are not the only output: there's also command returns.

Consider query-cpus-fast.  Returns list of CpuInfoFast.  CpuInfoFast
member @arch is deprecated.  deprecated-output=3Dhide should hide it,
except it's not implemented in this series.

This is also "a fairly passive impact on libvirt", I'm afraid.

We have some 40 events, and having libvirt subscribe to the ones it
actually uses is obviously practical.

I doubt the subscription idea scales up to return values.
