So it's been a little while and I've been trying some different
approaches.  I think the problem I am having is because I don't have the
required kernel modules loaded.  When I run lsmod I only see the following
two modules loaded:

Module                  Size  Used by
nfsd                  100940  11
exportfs                6723  1 nfsd

The archlinux website says the following modules need to be running:

kvm_intel             245760  0
kvmgt                  28672  0
mdev                   20480  2 kvmgt,vfio_mdev
vfio                   32768  3 kvmgt,vfio_mdev,vfio_iommu_type1
kvm                   737280  2 kvmgt,kvm_intel
irqbypass              16384  1 kvm

Granted that I am running on a powerpc processor not an intel processor,
the modules that I myself to need to load will be a little different from
that.  But I can't find those modules to load on my device.  For example, I
can't find a kvm.ko file on the device despite the fact that I was able to
find the kvm directories I mentioned earlier.  Did I have to compile those
modules myself?  In the kvm module directory there is C code and a
makefile, but just running make doesn't work.

Note that I'm using a Yocto Linux system that I myself didn't build.  My
coworker built the Linux system on SD card and was in the process of trying
to figure out if kvm was actually enabled on the system or not before he
left the company.  I'm learning about the system as I go.
