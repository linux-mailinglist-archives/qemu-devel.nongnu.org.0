I think we should hold old code to the same standard.  Anything that's
not compiled now either gets fixed or deprecated.  If it's still unfixed
at the end of the deprecation grace period, it goes.

How do we track compliance?  It's not obvious to (ignorant) me what
features exactly each CI compile enables.  Without that, it's not
obvious whether any CI run enables use of a certain library.

Native tool chain in CI also satisfies "must be compiled in CI".

Non-virtual host in CI also satisfies "must be compiled in CI".

Feels like a no-brainer, to be honest.

Spot the weasel words!  ;-P

We've been pushing, but not evenly.  It's basically up to maintainers,
and their expectations on testing vary.

That makes Macs a secondary host at best.  If it breaks, it breaks.  If
somebody fixes it, nice, if not, *shrug*.  Don't expect git-bisect to
work.
