I'm fine with accepting only node names.  But unless we're fairly
certain node names will do, we should try to pick an interface that can
be extended to drive IDs painlessly.

The common pattern appears to be

    # Either @device or @node-name must be set but not both.
    #
    # @device: the name of the device to get the image resized
    #
    # @node-name: graph node name to get the image resized (Since 2.0)
    #
    [...]
                '*device': 'str',
                '*node-name': 'str',

For snapshot-save & friends, I can see two reasonably consistent ways:

1. Have two optional lists, must specify exactly one of them.

2. Change the list element from 'str' to a struct with the two optional
members, must specify exactly one.

The second way lets you mix drive IDs and node-names freely.  Do we want
to?

If yes, we can still use a variation of the first way: accept *both*
lists.

Permitting mixing makes it possible to specify the same device twice.
Could be silently accepted, or made a hard error.  Matter of taste.
