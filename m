Both fine.

This is a bug.

If that was required, my doc comment would demand it.

If you construct a hint with multiple calls, individual calls need not
terminate with a newline, but the resulting hint still should.

I readily admit that my doc comments sometimes require a "lawyerly"
reading :)

That's the intended behavior.

Would also be workable, if slightly less flexible.

Yes, error_setg() and error_append_hint() differ on newlines.

error_setg() constructs an error message.  These get reported in a rigid
format that does not afford line breaks in the middle.

error_append_hint() builds up a hint.  Hints are free-form text.
Embedded line breaks are fine.

In both cases, I decided not to treat newline at the end any different
from newlines anywhere else.  Thus, no newlines at all with
error_setg(), and newlines after every line including the last one with
error_append_hint().

Correct.

Hope this helps!
