I wrote that one, and I think changing it from strong to emphasis is an
improvement.  Let's point to it in the commit message, and call it a
day.

I understand the difficulty of parsing rST (Paolo called it "the Perl of
markup languages" for a reason).  What I don't yet understand is (1) why
we need to recognize the document structure of doc comments, and (2) why
we can do that by recognizing '=3D' markup, but ignore the native rST
document structure markup.
