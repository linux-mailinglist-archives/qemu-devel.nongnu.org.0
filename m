Should we put the documentation of machine options under this directory ?=

There, I could put the 'info pic' documentation.

ecs

and there, the low level information on the XIVE controller.

and finally, there, some of the documentation on QEMU modeling. =20

the information related to one topic in one place.=20

Can manuals reference each another ?=20
