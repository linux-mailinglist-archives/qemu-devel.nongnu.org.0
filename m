I think I agree with Eduardo it's very important to handle this corner
case correctly. Fast networking outside migration is why people use
failover at all.  Someone who can live with a slower virtio would use
just that.

And IIRC this corner case is exactly why libvirt could not
implement it correctly itself and had to push it up the stack
until it fell off the cliff :).
