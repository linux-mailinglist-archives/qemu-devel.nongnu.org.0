Thanks Philippe for sharing this, and I agree completely, it is very draining.

The effort of making tests happy that run in artificial environments in particular often feels to me
as too disconnected from actually ensuring that there is no real run time regression.

qtest_enabled() (implicitly, or explicitly via open-ended else statements) is another painful variable to keep in mind in cpu and machine code, so it is not helpful in my view.

I'll try to push more to get the tests running again, if you have any comment or idea, feel free to just point me in the right direction,
that is very valuable to me, even without working code.

Currently I am struggling with arm-cpu-features and other tests (device-introspect-test, qom-test, test-hmp).

I'll publish arm_cleanup_v5 soon,

Thanks a lot,

Claudio
