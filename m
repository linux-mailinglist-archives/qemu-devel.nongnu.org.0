KVM requires all VCPUs to have a PMU if one does. If the ARM ARM
says it's possible to have PMUs for only some CPUs, then, for TCG,
the restriction could be relaxed. I expect it will take more than
just removing the check for things to work though.

I don't know, but it doesn't sound like a configuration I'd like
to see.

It's purpose is to keep users from doing 'pmu=on' on 2.6 machine
types. On 2.7 and later machine types if you don't want a PMU
you should use 'pmu=off'.

Agreed. The function has the wrong name. mach-virt has many functions that
mix the initialization and fdt building together, but those functions are
named something like create_foo(). Patches welcome.

Thanks,
