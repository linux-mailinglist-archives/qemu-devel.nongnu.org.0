Commit 076a93d797 was one of the patchset where we want to provide
sensible IOTLB entries and also that should start to work with huge
pages.  Frankly speaking after a few years I forgot the original
motivation of that whole thing, but IIRC there's a patch that was
trying to speedup especially for vhost but I noticed it's not merged:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-06/msg00574.html

Regarding to the current patch, I'm not sure I understand it
correctly, but is that performance issue only happens when (1) there's
no intel-iommu device, and (2) there is iommu_platform=3Don specified
for the vhost backend?

If so, I'd confess I am not too surprised if this fails the boot with
vhost-vsock because after all we speicified iommu_platform=3Don
explicitly in the cmdline, so if we want it to work we can simply
remove that iommu_platform=3Don when vhost-vsock doesn't support it
yet...  I thougth iommu_platform=3Don was added for that case - when we
want to force IOMMU to be enabled from host side, and it should always
be used with a vIOMMU device.

However I also agree that from performance POV this patch helps for
this quite special case.

Thanks,
