So we only need clear flags for before the fp op that are running before
the read flags are
triggered?  So the key point is finding all the read flags op, and find the
latest clear flags op
before the latest fp op instuction that before the read flags. May this be
expressed in TCG ops?

<br>
whether or not we need to be able to calculate the flags for fpOpA will<br>
depend on if fpOpB completely resets the flags visible or if the result<br>
is additive.<br>
<br>
So in short I think there may be scope for using hardfloat but it will<br>
require knowledge of front-end knowing if it is safe to skip flag<br>
calculation in particular cases. We might even need support within TCG<br>
for saving (and marking) temporaries over potentially faulting<br>
boundaries so these lazy evaluations can be done. We can certainly add a<br=
>
fp-status less set of primitives to softfloat which can use the<br>
hardfloat path when we know we are using normal numbers.<br>

&gt;&gt; I am confusing why only=C2=A0 inexact=C2=A0 are set then we can us=
e hard-float.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The inexact behaviour of the host hardware may be different from the g=
uest architecture we are trying to emulate and the host hardware may not be=
 configurable to emulate the guest mode.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Have a look in softfloat.c and see all the places where float_flag_ine=
xact is set. Can you convince yourself that the host hardware will do the s=
ame?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; And PPC always clearing inexact=C2=A0 flag before calling to soft-=
float <br>
&gt;&gt; funcitons. so we can not optimize it with hard-float.<br>
&gt;&gt; I need some resouces about ineact flag and why always clearing ine=
xcat <br>
&gt;&gt; in PPC FP simualtion.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Because that is the behaviour of the PPC floating point unit. The inex=
act flag will represent the last operation done.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I am looking for two possible solution:<br>
&gt;&gt; 1. do not clear inexact flag in PPC simulation 2. even the inexact=
 are <br>
&gt;&gt; cleared, we can still use alternative hard-float.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; But now I am the beginner, Have no clue about all the things.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Well you&#39;ll need to learn about floating point because these are r=
ather fundamental aspects of it&#39;s behaviour. In the old days QEMU used =
to use the host floating point processor with it&#39;s template based trans=
lation.<br>
&gt; However this led to lots of weird bugs because the floating point answ=
ers under qemu where different from the target it was trying to emulate. It=
 was for this reason softfloat was introduced. The hardfloat optimisation c=
an only be done when we are confident that we will get the exact same answe=
r of the target we are trying to emulate - a &quot;faster but incorrect&quo=
t; mode is just going to cause confusion as discussed in the previous threa=
d. Have you read that yet?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; amd Richard&#39;s reply immediately below that. In short =
to optimise <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; FPU emulation we would either find a way to compute inexa=
ct flag <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; quickly without reading the FPU status (this may not be p=
ossible) <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; or somehow get status from the FPU but the obvious way of=
 claring <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the flag and reading them after each operation is too slo=
w. So <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; maybe using exceptions and only clearing when actually th=
ere&#39;s a <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; change could be faster.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As to how to use exceptions see this message in above thr=
ead:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc=
/2020-03/msg00005.htm" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://lists.n=
ongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-03/msg00005.htm</a><br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; l<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s only to show how to hook in an exception h=
andler what it <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; does needs to be implemented. Then tested and benchmarked=
.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I still don&#39;t know where are the extensive PPC floati=
ng point tests <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to use for checking results though as that was never answ=
ered.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Specifically for PPC we don&#39;t have them. We use the softfl=
oat test <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cases to exercise our softfloat/hardfloat code as part of &quo=
t;make <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; check-softfloat&quot;. You can also re-build fp-bench for each=
 guest <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; target to measure raw throughput.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However in short the problem is if the float_flag_ine=
xact is clear <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you must use softfloat so you can properly calculate =
the inexact <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; status. We can&#39;t take advantage of the inexact st=
ickiness without <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; loosing the fidelity of the calculation.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I still don&#39;t get why can&#39;t we use hardware via e=
xception handler <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to detect flags for us and why do we only use hardfloat i=
n some <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; corner cases. If reading the status is too costly then we=
 could <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; mirror it in a global which is set by an FP exception han=
dler. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Shouldn&#39;t that be faster? Is there a reason that can&=
#39;t work?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It would work but it would be slow. Almost every FP operation =
sets <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the inexact flag so it would generate an exception and excepti=
ons <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; take time to process.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; For the guests where we use hardfloat operations with inexact =
already <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; latched is not a corner case - it is the common case which is =
why it <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; helps.<br>
