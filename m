Could you delegate that part to QEMU, as in the v6 patches?  The
firmware would record the path<->ihandle association on open and close,
and then you can use that when GRUB does "read" and "write" to invoke
the appropriate driver.

Again, sorry if what I'm saying makes little sense.  The terminology is
certainly off.  What I mean is:

- read the device tree, instantiate all PCI and virtio drivers

- keep the device tree around for use while GRUB is running

- find and invoke GRUB

- on the OF entry point, wrap open and close + handle the disk and
network entry points, and pass everything else to QEMU.

They wouldn't with Alexey's code either, would they?  And it would be
yet another QEMU backend to hook into, while with firmware it would be
lots of code to write but super-boring and something that has been done
countless times.

Can you get that with SLOF?

Any reason to make it USB and not a virtio-blk device?  (On x86 these
days you only add USB storage disks to a VM in order to get drivers to
Windows).
