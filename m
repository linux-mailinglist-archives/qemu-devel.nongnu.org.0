Which ones exactly?
Do you want me to rebuild this set on top of those, or drop the docs for
now until after they're in (I'm happy for you to drop the docs patches
and merge the rest of this series, which would seem the quickest way).

I think it is actually specific to this virtiofsd implementation.

Yes it does, see 'virtiofsd: add man page' (patch 0094),
tools/virtiofsd/virtiofsd.texi

Note that doc I've added here doesn't define protocol or anything like
that between qemu and the guest; it's purely a doc talking about what
someone using that daemon sees.

Ah, happy to fix that.
