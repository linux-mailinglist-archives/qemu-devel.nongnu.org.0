This would require management tools to automatically do this or we would
break any users that don't manually invoke QEMU. I don't think this is a
realistic option, especially since "management tools" must probably
include all those one-off shell scripts that people use.

I would have considered this as part of the bug rather than a desirable
future behaviour. blk_check_byte_request() tries to catch any request
going past EOF, it just doesn't know anything about request_alignment.
