Ah, ok.

Yes, that sounds good, and we even already have a spot for it in the
sprs array.

At first I was thinking we'd need to fiddle about with adjusting it
afterwards to account for the migration downtime (as we do for tb),
but then I realised that it probably makes more sense *not* to count
the migration downtime against purr and spurr, which makes it even
easier.

Ok, sounds good, therefore:
