Make sense, clang-format can also only formatting the changed lines,
checkpatch also does what? do you means about the MAINTAINER? that can be
preserved
we can use clang-format as a part of checkpatch.
The current problem with checkpatch is that is doesn't understand C well.
Sometimes will arise werid errors.

For example, what's does this means?

25/30 Checking commit 9e2a36e4c279 (plugin: Getting qemu-plugin.h can be
included in multiple source file)
ERROR: storage class should be at the beginning of the declaration
#74: FILE: include/qemu/qemu-plugin.h:432:
+#define qemu_plugin_decl_symbol(symbol_name) extern symbol_name##_t
symbol_name

total: 1 errors, 0 warnings, 88 lines checked

Patch 25/30 has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
