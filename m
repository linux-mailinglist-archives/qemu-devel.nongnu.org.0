This all boils down to the semantics of "dual"... "XICS AND XIVE" or "any
of XICS or XIVE" ?

We already have a precedent when using pre-power9 compat mode. If the
user passes ic-mode=3Ddual,max-compat-cpu=3Dpower8, we internally convert
"dual" to act as "xics". The rationale is that a guest running in
power8 architected mode isn't supposed to know about XIVE at all.

Should we forbid this config and exit QEMU instead ?

This is the logical consequence of turning "dual" into "xics".

>=20

Yeah. If the semantics of "dual" is to always advertise XICS AND XIVE, and =
we
keep the current fallback behavior, then we need each implementation to have
proper init/teardown support as well as proper rollback on error paths.

This is definitely not the case: rollback is missing in both in-kernel=20
XICS and XIVE code and the emulated XICS and XIVE don't have teardown.

This can generate a variety of bugs, including QEMU crashes... the old KVM =
case
is just one of them, but there might be others.

Yeah, probably many other patches...

The real problem is when you don't pass kernel_irqchip at all. Combined
with "dual", this gives a fair number of cases. Do we want to support
all possible transitions ?

>=20

Using KVM XICS is indeed better than QEMU XIVE... but IIUC what David
is saying, kernel-irqchip semantics are:

- on: user favors performance, at the expense of a reduced spectrum
      of usable hosts

- absent: user favors being able to start the VM on a wider spectrum
          of hosts, at the possible expense of performance

- off: user wants the VM to start on any host, doesn't care for
       performance at all

So the only way to have 1. KVM XIVE 2.KVM XICS would be to pass "on".
