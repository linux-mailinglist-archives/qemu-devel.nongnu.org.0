I'm glad you like how it turned out.  Now to fix the problems ;)

Yes.  That, or "${cmd#'{'}" should also work.

And I should therefore fix the filter to display it as something more=20
stable (perhaps nbd:HOST:PORT).  But I also agree that the hard-coded=20
value is pre-existing broken, so a separate patch here to improve it is=20
warranted.

Agreed. I will rebase a v3 on top of your pending series.

Yep, I'll have to improve the filtering.  I'll make sure I run -qed=20
tests before posting v3.

or _filter_imgfmt.  It should not be hard to turn on extra filters, such=20
that this looks more like:

'snapshot-file': 'TEST_DIR/t.IMGFMT.overlay', 'format': 'IMGFMT', ...
