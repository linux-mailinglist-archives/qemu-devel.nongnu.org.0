There is no "version 2" of the "Lesser" General Public License.
It is either "GPL version 2.0" or "Lesser GPL version 2.1".
This patch replaces all occurrences of "Lesser GPL version 2" with
"Lesser GPL version 2.1" in comment section.

This patch contains all the files, whose maintainer I could not get
from ‘get_maintainer.pl’ script.
