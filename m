Or even LESS overhead.  Heap allocationhave unspecified contents=20
requiring runtime effort (true, some implementations of malloc() handle=20
large allocations specially as anonymous mmap initially backed by=20
/dev/zero, so that those allocations start life 0-allocated, but you=20
can't rely on that optimization), while .bss is required by the C=20
language to be 0 initialized (and you CAN rely on the OS implementing=20
that as efficiently as possible, generally by starting with COW mapping=20
initially backed by the zero page).

In fact, on nbdkit, we hit an interesting case where using .bss instead=20
of .rodata is actually beneficial:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2019-July/msg00074.html
Marking a large array that will always consist only of zero bytes as=20
const actually pessimized the image size and load time, because the=20
addition of const moved the array from .bss into .rodata.

Yes. Smaller data structures allow for smaller binaries and faster loading.
