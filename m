Introduce cpu properties to give fine control over SVE vector lengths.
We introduce a property for each valid length up to the current
maximum supported, which is 2048-bits. The properties are named, e.g.
sve128, sve256, sve384, sve512, ..., where the number is the number of
bits. See the updates to docs/arm-cpu-features.rst for a description
of the semantics and for example uses.

Note, as sve-max-vq is still present and we'd like to be able to
support qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion with guests launched with e.g.
-cpu max,sve-max-vq=3D8 on their command lines, then we do allow
sve-max-vq and sve<N> properties to be provided at the same time, but
this is not recommended, and is why sve-max-vq is not mentioned in the
document.  If sve-max-vq is provided then it enables all lengths smaller
than and including the max and disables all lengths larger. It also has
the side-effect that no larger lengths may be enabled and that the max
itself cannot be disabled. Smaller non-power-of-two lengths may,
however, be disabled, e.g. -cpu max,sve-max-vq=3D4,sve384=3Doff provides a
guest the vector lengths 128, 256, and 512 bits.

This patch has been co-authored with Richard Henderson, who reworked
the target/arm/cpu64.c changes in order to push all the validation and
auto-enabling/disabling steps into the finalizer, resulting in a nice
LOC reduction.

+defaults, it would seem we need to disable many SVE vector lengths, rather
+than only enabling the two we want.  This isn't the case, because, as
+disabling many SVE vector lengths would be quite verbose, the `sve<N>` CPU
+properties have special semantics (see "SVE CPU Property Parsing
+Semantics").
+
+SVE CPU Properties
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+There are two types of SVE CPU properties: `sve` and `sve<N>`.  The first
+is used to enable or disable the entire SVE feature, just as the `pmu`
+CPU property completely enables or disables the PMU.  The second type
+is used to enable or disable specific vector lengths, where `N` is the
+number of bits of the length.  The `sve<N>` CPU properties have special
+dependencies and constraints, see "SVE CPU Property Dependencies and
+Constraints" below.  Additionally, as we want all supported vector lengths
+to be enabled by default, then, in order to avoid overly verbose command
+lines (command lines full of `sve<N>=3Doff`, for all `N` not wanted), we
+provide the parsing semantics listed in "SVE CPU Property Parsing
+Semantics".
+
+SVE CPU Property Dependencies and Constraints
+---------------------------------------------
+
+  1) At least one vector length must be enabled when `sve` is enabled.
+
+  2) If a vector length `N` is enabled, then all power-of-two vector
+     lengths smaller than `N` must also be enabled.  E.g. if `sve512`
+     is enabled, then the 128-bit and 256-bit vector lengths must also
+     be enabled.
+
+SVE CPU Property Parsing Semantics
+----------------------------------
+
+  1) If SVE is disabled (`sve=3Doff`), then which SVE vector lengths
+     are enabled or disabled is irrelevant to the guest, as the entire
+     SVE feature is disabled and that disables all vector lengths for
+     the guest.  However QEMU will still track any `sve<N>` CPU
+     properties provided by the user.  If later an `sve=3Don` is provided,
+     then the guest will get only the enabled lengths.  If no `sve=3Don`
+     is provided and there are explicitly enabled vector lengths, then
+     an error is generated.
+
+  2) If SVE is enabled (`sve=3Don`), but no `sve<N>` CPU properties are
+     provided, then all supported vector lengths are enabled, including
+     the non-power-of-two lengths.
+
+  3) If SVE is enabled, then an error is generated when attempting to
+     disable the last enabled vector length (see constraint (1) of "SVE
+     CPU Property Dependencies and Constraints").
+
+  4) If one or more vector lengths have been explicitly enabled and at
+     at least one of the dependency lengths of the maximum enabled length
+     has been explicitly disabled, then an error is generated (see
+     constraint (2) of "SVE CPU Property Dependencies and Constraints").
+
+  5) If one or more `sve<N>` CPU properties are set `off`, but no `sve<N>`=
,
+     CPU properties are set `on`, then the specified vector lengths are
+     disabled but the default for any unspecified lengths remains enabled.
+     Disabling a power-of-two vector length also disables all vector
+     lengths larger than the power-of-two length (see constraint (2) of
+     "SVE CPU Property Dependencies and Constraints").
+
+  6) If one or more `sve<N>` CPU properties are set to `on`, then they
+     are enabled and all unspecified lengths default to disabled, except
+     for the required lengths per constraint (2) of "SVE CPU Property
+     Dependencies and Constraints", which will even be auto-enabled if
+     they were not explicitly enabled.
+
+  7) If SVE was disabled (`sve=3Doff`), allowing all vector lengths to be
+     explicitly disabled (i.e. avoiding the error specified in (3) of
+     "SVE CPU Property Parsing Semantics"), then if later an `sve=3Don` is
+     provided an error will be generated.  To avoid this error, one must
+     enable at least one vector length prior to enabling SVE.
+
+SVE CPU Property Examples
+-------------------------
+
+  1) Disable SVE::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve=3Doff
+
+  2) Implicitly enable all vector lengths for the `max` CPU type::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max
+
+  3) Only enable the 128-bit vector length::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve128=3Don
+
+  4) Disable the 512-bit vector length and all larger vector lengths,
+     since 512 is a power-of-two.  This results in all the smaller,
+     uninitialized lengths (128, 256, and 384) defaulting to enabled::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve512=3Doff
+
+  5) Enable the 128-bit, 256-bit, and 512-bit vector lengths::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve128=3Don,sve256=3Don,sve512=
=3Don
+
+  6) The same as (5), but since the 128-bit and 256-bit vector
+     lengths are required for the 512-bit vector length to be enabled,
+     then allow them to be auto-enabled::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve512=3Don
+
+  7) Do the same as (6), but by first disabling SVE and then re-enabling i=
t::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve=3Doff,sve512=3Don,sve=3Don
+
+  8) Force errors regarding the last vector length::
+
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve128=3Doff
+     $ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu max,sve=3Doff,sve128=3Doff,sve=3Do=

+SVE CPU Property Recommendations
+--------------------------------
=20
-The example above disables the PMU for the `max` CPU type.
+The examples in "SVE CPU Property Examples" exhibit many ways to select
+vector lengths which developers may find useful in order to avoid overly
+verbose command lines.  However, the recommended way to select vector
+lengths is to explicitly enable each desired length.  Therefore only
+example's (1), (3), and (5) exhibit recommended uses of the properties.
