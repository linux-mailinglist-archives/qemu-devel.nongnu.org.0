I think theoretically the Marvell Discovery II chip can support dual CPU 
and meybe even a G5, this is described in its docs. However in practice 
this was never implemented for Pegasos2 and there was only either a G3 or 
G4 single CPU card available for it. It probably does not make much sense 
to emulate anything else than the G4 version as that's what has the most 
features that guest OSes can use. The current emulation is just enough for 
that and I don't plan to implement more of the MV64361 chip to emulate non 
existent SMP configs as probably nothing would run on it anyway so it does 
not worth the extra effort.

Maybe interesting for history behind Pegasos2 only but otherwise probably 
not too relevant to how it was actually implemented at the end which is 
what counts if you want to run existing guests OSes. This doc seems to 
describe a system that wasn't implemented but instead a similar system was 
made from off the shelf components available at the time so for emulation 
a better reference are the docs of those chips.
