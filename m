My concern is that libslirp is just showing us one known example of
the problem. QEMU links to many more external libraries, which might
exhibit similar issues. If we need to rebuild all the dependancies
with CFI too, to be confident that the combined work will operate
correctly, then this is quite a significant implication. Overall I
think this is going to be a problem for the changes of distros adopting
the use of CFI, especially if they're not using CLang as their toolchain.

Daniel
