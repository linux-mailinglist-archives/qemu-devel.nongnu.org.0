Once you make the recorder a trace backend, whatever the recorder does

I'm not sure I get the parenthesis.

I guess "simple" doesn't format either, but it still writes to disk.

The combination of "always on" and "minimal overhead" is obviously
useful.

I'm hardly an expert on tracing in QEMU, I merely use it from time to
time.  I am the QMP maintainer, though.  Adding new commands for every
new thing is easy.  Proper integration takes thought.  And that's what
we're doing.

As far as I can tell, QEMU has no concept of a "trace" in the sense of
your definition.  There are only individual trace events.  Enabled trace
events emit via the enabled trace backends.  Simple & stupid.

Enabled trace events get emitted to the configured backends, which can
do whatever they want with the events.

Current trace backends emit to a single destination (log: stderr,
simple: a file, ftrace: the kernel, nop: the bit bucket, you get the
idea), but that's detail.

My (possibly naive) expecation for a recorder backend: as always, only
the enabled trace events get emitted to the recorder backend.  All of
"circular buffer (always), display if tracing is active, copy if sharing
is active" happens within the backend.  In particular, enabling a trace
event cannot control the "tracing is active" bit.  It effectively
controls the "is recorded in a circular buffer" bit.  Correct?

I guess much of the confusion comes from the fact that trace backends
are just that, but the recorder is more.

Trace backends emit trace events.

The recorder can *also* emit trace events.  But it primarily records.  I
figure users commonly record more events than they trace.

If you do the recorder as a trace backend, then the existing UI to
control what's being traced becomes UI to control what's being recorded
by the recorder and traced by everything else.  Confusing, and we're
short one UI to control what's being traced by the recorder.

Perhaps doing the recorder as a trace backend is simply a bad idea.
Perhaps it should be integrated in the trace subsystem differently, so
that trace-enable continues to control what's being traced for all
backends.

Perhaps the recorder should emit the events it traces to a trace
backend.

No, but by configuring two trace backends, you ask each one to do its
thing.  If "its thing" includes printing to stderr for both, then
getting events printed twice is exactly what you asked for.

Christophe, leave that windmill alone!  I'm over here!  ;)

I'm not trying to shoot down commands specific to trace backends.  I'm
trying to understand how the proposed recorder backend interacts with
the existing tracing UI and infrastructure, so I can figure out how to
best fit it with the existing UI and infrastructure.

QEMU's tracing subsystem consists of a common, backend-independent part
and backends.

Command trace-event controls one aspect of the common part: whether to
hand the trace event to the backend or not.  The backend has no say in
that.

Command trace-file controls one aspect of the backend: writing output to
a file.  Only the simple backend makes use of it, but that's detail.

You tell me the recorder backend needs to expose more configuration to
really make sense.  The question isn't whether that's true (I trust you
on that), it's how to best integrate it with what we have.

You're talking about the configuration file specified with trace
events=...

The existing UI for the recorder library is different.  Hardly a
surprise.

Consistency between the existing UI for the common part and the new UI
for the recorder backend is quite desirable.  I'm not making it a hard
requirement.  I would like to see concrete ideas on how to get it,
though.
