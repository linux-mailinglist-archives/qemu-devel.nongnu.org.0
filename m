If we ever enhance TCG... until this get done, I concur with David's
idea of just printing a warning. System emulation+TCG is more a CI
or developer thing: we just want FWNMI not to break anything, even
if it doesn't work. KVM is the real life scenario we want to support.
If the feature is valuable, and I think it is, it should be the
default otherwise fewer people will have a chance to take benefit
from it.
