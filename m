I shared the same concern. As device emulator (QEMU), you know where 
guest would reject or delay - it's even agnostic bios/grub should 
respond to hot plug or not. You don't even know whether guest has the 
support for ACPI hotplug, surprise removal, do you? How QEMU infer what 
is the right disposition by telling apart these guest states?
