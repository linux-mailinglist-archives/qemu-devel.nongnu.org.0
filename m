Yes, that's been my view. These tools *are* new and they *do* change 
often. Chasing a wide compatibility window with them is prohibitively 
difficult. Luckily, they're not needed for running the packages at all.

If I do add linting to 'make check', it is going to be through a virtual 
environment that deploys *specific versions* of these tools, and it will 
happen transparently. The VM tests already do this.
