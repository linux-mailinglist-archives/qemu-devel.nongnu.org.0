Defining it to be x86_64 semantics is effectively saying "we're not going
to do anything and it is up to other arch maintainers to fix the inevitable
portability problems that arise".

Since this is a new protocol should we take the opportunity to model it
explicitly in some common standard RPC protocol language. This would have
the benefit of allowing implementors to use off the shelf APIs for their
wire protocol marshalling, and eliminate questions about endianness and
alignment across architectures.
