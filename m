Hi,
I can still trigger stack-overflows, heap-UAFs and heap-overflows in the
code, but Mark's patches fixed some of the issues. I didn't want to
flood the issue-tracker with further problems in this code, since it
isn't clear what the security expectations are for this device. Of
course it is only a matter of time until someone sends more reports to
qemu-security.

Mark, do you want me to provide more reproducers for this device?
-Alex

Title:
  QEMU: use after free vulnerability in esp_do_dma() in hw/scsi/esp.c

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the am53c974 SCSI host bus
  adapter emulation of QEMU. It could occur in the esp_do_dma() function
  in hw/scsi/esp.c while handling the 'Information Transfer' command
  (CMD_TI). A privileged guest user may abuse this flaw to crash the
  QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service or
  potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.

  This issue was reported by Cheolwoo Myung (Seoul National University).

  Original report:
  Using hypervisor fuzzer, hyfuzz, I found a use-after-free issue in
  am53c974 emulator of QEMU enabled ASan.

  It occurs while transferring information, as it does not check the
  buffer to be transferred.

  A malicious guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU
  process resulting in DoS scenario.

  To reproduce this issue, please run the QEMU with the following command
  line.

  # To enable ASan option, please set configuration with the following
  $ ./configure --target-list=3Di386-softmmu --disable-werror --enable-sani=
tizers
  $ make

  # To reproduce this issue, please run the QEMU process with the following=
 command line
  $ ./qemu-system-i386 -m 512 -drive file=3D./hyfuzz.img,index=3D0,media=3D=
disk,format=3Draw \
  -device am53c974,id=3Dscsi -device scsi-hd,drive=3DSysDisk \
  -drive id=3DSysDisk,if=3Dnone,file=3D./disk.img

  Please find attached the disk images to reproduce this issue.
