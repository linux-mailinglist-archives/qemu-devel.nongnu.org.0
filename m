Agree.

I guess that depends on what this interoperability capability does for
QMP *input*.

For *output*, QEMU has to encode a number either as JSON number or as
JSON string

For *input*, QEMU could accept either.  Or it could accept only the
encoding it produces on output.

Got a preference?

Sucks :)

But then JSON does.
