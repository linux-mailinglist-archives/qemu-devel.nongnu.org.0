Ah, I missed that trick.  But it is nice, and indeed...

...we can now hit a request that is not cluster-aligned.

Hmm. In the pre-patch code, qcow2_co_pwrite_zeroes() calls 
qcow2_cluster_zeroize() which can fail with -ENOTSUP up front, but not 
after the fact.  Once it starts the while loop over clusters, its use of 
zero_in_l2_slice() handles compressed clusters just fine; as far as I 
can tell, only your new subcluster handling lets it now fail with 
-ENOTSUP after earlier clusters have been visited.

But isn't this something we could solve recursively?  Instead of 
returning -ENOTSUP, we could have zero_in_l2_slice() call 
bdrv_pwrite_zeroes() on the (sub-)clusters associated with a compressed 
cluster.
