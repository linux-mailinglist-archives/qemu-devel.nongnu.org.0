I still prefer the v3 approach that reflects the actual dependencies in
the code. With the priorities approach, we try to represent a tree of
devices (a structure we already have) with an additional flat list of
numbers. While these numbers can actually provide all the information
that we need in practice in this specific case, it still feels a bit
hacky and might not be extensible to future cases.

But in the end, if Paolo feels strongly that for whatever reason
propagating events through the real device tree isn't good, let's get
the bug fixed with whatever hack it takes.
