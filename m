I haven't took a deep look at that series. Technically dirty bitmap=20
could be shared between device and driver, then there's no system call=20
in synchronization.

Yes, it depends on the behavior of vIOMMU driver, e.g the frequency and=20
granularity of the flushing.

Note that the HVA to GPA mapping is not an 1:1 mapping. One HVA range=20
could be mapped to several GPA ranges.

Or provide GPA to HVA mapping as vhost did. But a question is, I believe=20
device can only do dirty page logging through IOVA. So how do you handle=20
the case when IOVA is removed in this case?
