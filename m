The reboot-timeout one was accidental - it was a documented qemu
feature; just no one noticed it when the input check was added.
Officially if we actually want to deprecate a feature we should actually
follow qemu's deprecation guidelines.

Yes that should happen;  with deprecated devices it's easier than more
subtle features like command line things;  I'm not sure how that gets
introspected.  I thought libvirt already asked qemu for a list of
devices, so I'm confused why libvirt didn't spot it before starting the
VM in 1745868.
