I haven't seen enough analysis to declare boot time optimization done.
QEMU startup can be profiled and improved.

The numbers show that removing PCI and ACPI makes things faster but
this doesn't justify removing them.  Understanding of why they are
slow is what justifies removing them.  Otherwise it could just be a
misconfiguration, inefficient implementation, etc and we've seen there
is low-hanging fruit.

How much time is spent doing PCI initialization?  Is the vmexit
pattern for PCI initialization as good as the hardware interface
allows?

Without an analysis of why things are slow it's not possible come to
an informed decision.
