Do you need a copyright and license header here? Especially if this is not 
all your original work but based on previous code (don't know if it is 
just saying in case as I know Mark also had some similar patches before 
but not sure how are those related if at all). If this contains code from 
somewhere else then license and author of that code may need to be 
included too.

Replacing with %lu may fix 32bit build but would break 64bit one. Use 
HWADDR_PRIx format string instead to print hwaddr but others will probably 
tell to remove DPRINTFs alltogether when they are not needed any more and 
replace the remaining few useful ones with traces if debugging is still 
needed. I don't mind DPRINTFs that much at least until things are stable 
enough but once the code is stable most DPRINTFs may not be needed any 
more.

I can't really review the actual patch because I don't know audio in QEMU.
