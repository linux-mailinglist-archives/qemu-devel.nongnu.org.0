I think we shouldn't really call this "allocating" because we don't
actually reserve space for it yet. On a filesystem, you get a large file
size, but it's almost completely sparse. On block devices, it depends on
whether the storage has thin provisioning.

Actually, this is not much less, but just split in two places. You still
have the 500 GB data file. The metadata is small, but it was already
small before:

536953094144 - 536870912000 = ~78 MB.

Not exactly sure why it's more than the 64 MB you get for an external
data file, maybe some alignment thing, but not significant anyway.
