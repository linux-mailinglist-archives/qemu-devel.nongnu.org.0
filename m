I don't think it would be unreasonable to require a cluster size that is
a multiple of the logical block size of your host storage if you want to
use O_DIRECT.

But we have unaligned images in practice, so this is pure theory anyway.

It's not nice, but I think we already have this kind of behaviour for
unlocking failures. So yes, that sounds like an option.

Automatically resizing the image file is obviously harmless for qcow2
images, but it would be a guest-visible change for raw images. It might
be better to avoid this.
