Thanks Phil - I understand that a set of 42 patches for a 25 year old disk controller 
is never going to be the top of most people's review list, and some parts are almost 
impossible to review unless you have a good understanding of the datasheet.

I'll see if Laurent has any comments over the next few days, but other than that I'd 
be inclined to send a v3 followed soon by a PR to avoid me having to update these 
regularly (I already see a slight conflict with Paolo's SCSI error handling changes, 
for example).


ATB,

Mark.
