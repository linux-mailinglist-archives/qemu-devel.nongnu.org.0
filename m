This is always the case, we always need to support old code for 2
versions when we add
new code. This is even worse. It makes sense only if this enables
stuff which is not possible
with qemu-img.

One case that we did not handle yet is copying bitmaps down after
"qemu-img commit",
which should be solved now in libvirt when using blockCommit(). If use
libvirt also for
cold-commit by running qemu paused, it makes sense to add this.

Another case we did not handle yet is backing up non-running vms,
which will also work
transparently if we run the vm paused just for the backup. So using
paused vm via
libvirt seems like a good direction.

We don't copy images in parallel yet. Currently we just copy the image
one by one,
starting at the base image in the chain. If we start to copy in
parallel, we will run multiple
qemu-img processes, each copying one layer in the chain. It should be
possible since
only the destination image is writable,  and qemu does not need to
read the backing file
not on the source or destination. I think we tried this but maybe it
was before qemu-img
added locking.

We use qmp for testing our nbd client, it is awesome. This is another optio=
n
we need to consider.
