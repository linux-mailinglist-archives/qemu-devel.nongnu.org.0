This is an oversight on my part - I didn't realize Debian releases
were supported for such a short time in parallel.

There should be a general statement that, no matter what else the
policy states, we do *NOT* support any distro that has been end of
life by its vendor.

I guess this is ok, since this. is still quite a long life time of
support for distros. eg RHEL has a 3-4 year gap between major
releases, that gives 4-5 years for each release being supported by
QEMU. Other LTS distros are similar
