From: Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@redhat.com>

The qtest and libqtest doc comments will be parsed to generate
API documentation, so move QTest documentation to its own
document where the API and format documentation and will be
included.

+========================================
+QTest Device Emulation Testing Framework
+========================================
+
+QTest is a device emulation testing framework.  It can be very useful to test
+device models; it could also control certain aspects of QEMU (such as virtual
+clock stepping), with a special purpose "qtest" protocol.  Refer to the
+documentation in ``qtest.c`` for more details of the protocol.
+
+QTest cases can be executed with
+
+.. code::
+
+   make check-qtest
+
+The QTest library is implemented by ``tests/qtest/libqtest.c`` and the API is
+defined in ``tests/qtest/libqtest.h``.
+
+Consider adding a new QTest case when you are introducing a new virtual
+hardware, or extending one if you are adding functionalities to an existing
+virtual device.
+
+On top of libqtest, a higher level library, ``libqos``, was created to
+encapsulate common tasks of device drivers, such as memory management and
+communicating with system buses or devices. Many virtual device tests use
+libqos instead of directly calling into libqtest.
+
+Steps to add a new QTest case are:
+
+1. Create a new source file for the test. (More than one file can be added as
+   necessary.) For example, ``tests/qtest/foo-test.c``.
+
+2. Write the test code with the glib and libqtest/libqos API. See also existing
+   tests and the library headers for reference.
+
+3. Register the new test in ``tests/qtest/Makefile.include``. Add the test
+   executable name to an appropriate ``check-qtest-*-y`` variable. For example:
+
+   ``check-qtest-generic-y = tests/qtest/foo-test$(EXESUF)``
+
+4. Add object dependencies of the executable in the Makefile, including the
+   test source file(s) and other interesting objects. For example:
+
+   ``tests/qtest/foo-test$(EXESUF): tests/qtest/foo-test.o $(libqos-obj-y)``
+
+Debugging a QTest failure is slightly harder than the unit test because the
+tests look up QEMU program names in the environment variables, such as
+``QTEST_QEMU_BINARY`` and ``QTEST_QEMU_IMG``, and also because it is not easy
+to attach gdb to the QEMU process spawned from the test. But manual invoking
+and using gdb on the test is still simple to do: find out the actual command
+from the output of
+
+.. code::
+
+  make check-qtest V=1
+
+which you can run manually.
