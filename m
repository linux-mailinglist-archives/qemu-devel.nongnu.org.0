Title:
  qemu-img created VMDK files lead to "Unsupported or invalid disk type
  7"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Using qemu-img version 3.1.50 (v3.1.0-13607-geb2db0f7ba-dirty) on a
  Windows 10 machine.

  Converting a VHD to VMDK.
  qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=3Dbu=
slogic -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

  I have also tried:
  qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=3Dbu=
slogic,hwversion=3D6 -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

  Attaching the VMDK to a VM in VMware produces the following error when
  powering on.

  Power On virtual machine:Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or inva=
lid disk type 7. Ensure that the disk has been imported.
  Target: MyVM1
  vCenter Server: VCENTER
  Error Stack
  An error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM MyVM1.
  Failed to start the virtual machine.
  Module DevicePowerOn power on failed. =

  Unable to create virtual SCSI device for scsi0:1, '/vmfs/volumes/5cca0155=
-bdddf31d-2714-00215acbeb1e/AppD-VM01/AppDdisk1-VM01.vmdk' =

  Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or invalid disk type 7. Ensure t=
hat the disk has been imported.

  =

  If I do not specify the adapter type, it creates an IDE VMDK which works =
perfectly.
