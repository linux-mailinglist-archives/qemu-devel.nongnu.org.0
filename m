Hi; I read through these patches last week, but I didn't reply
then because although there are some aspects to the design that
I don't like, I don't have a clear idea of what a better approach
to the problems it's trying to solve would be. However I didn't
want to go home for the end of the year without providing at
least some response. So I'm going to lay out the parts I have
issues with and perhaps somebody else will have a good idea.

The first part that I dislike here is that this is implementing
an entire ABI which in real hardware is provided by firmware. I
think that QEMU's design works best when QEMU provides emulation of
hardware or hardware-like facilities, which guest code (either
in the kernel, or firmware/bios running in the guest) can then
make use of. Once we start getting into implementing firmware
interfaces directly in QEMU this rapidly becomes a large amount
of work and code, and it's unclear where it should stop. Should
we implement also the equivalent of firmware for omap boards?
For imx* boards? For the raspberry pi? For xilinx boards?
Are we going to end up reimplementing more of ARM Trusted Firmware
functionality inside QEMU? The code to implement firmware-equivalent
ABIs in all these boards would I think quickly become a large part
of the codebase.

My second concern is that to do the things it wants to do,
the implementation here does some pretty invasive things:
 * intercepting interrupt lines which ought to just be
   emulated hardware signals between devices and the GIC
 * capturing register values of other CPUs, and arbitrarily
   stopping those other CPUs and making them run other code
   at a later point in time
I'm really uncomfortable with what's just an 'emulated firmware'
interface for one specific board model doing this kind of thing.

Finally, the stated rationale for the patchset ("we'd like an
emulated NMI equivalent") doesn't really feel to me like it's
strong enough to counterbalance the amount of code here and
the degree to which it's moving us into a swamp I'd prefer
it if we could stay out of.

I'd be much happier with a design where QEMU provides simple
facilities to the guest and the guest firmware and kernel
deal with making use of them. I appreciate that it's not
clear how that would work though, given that in real hardware
this works by the firmware running at EL3 and KVM not
providing a mechanism that allows guest code that runs at
a higher (effective or emulated) privilege level than the
guest kernel...

thanks
