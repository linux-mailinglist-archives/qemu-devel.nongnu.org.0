I understand restricting the API so that the system state cannot be
changed, only inspected.  I should have been more specific in my question.
I am attempting to create a plugin that tracks all memory accesses, so I
can emulate cache behavior.  The reason I would like to read the registers,
is because many load/store instructions depend on register values, which I
can only be sure of at run-time.
Some of the concepts you mentioned I am not very familiar with; I am simply
emulating an ARM A9 processor in bare-metal mode, to give you a point of
reference of my use case.

Could you please point me towards this tree?  I haven't run across it yet
in my investigating of all of this.

I'd be happy to look into ways to implement this functionality.  However, I
just started using Qemu this year, so these things sound like they would
have a steep learning curve for me.
The gdbstub approach seems like it would provide the most introspection
ability.  What would you suggest as a starting point for looking into this?
All of this being said, if you think my project is too complicated, to
implement a cache emulator with TCG plugins, then I could always try just
hacking together some custom helper functions.
