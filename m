Could you update tests/test-replication.c to test the extra steps?

> It's a bit more than that. Pacemaker itself is an Cluster Resource Manager, you can think of it like sysvinit but for clusters. It controls where in the cluster Resources run, what state (master/slave) and what to do in case of a Node or Resource failure. Now Resources can be anything like SQL-Server, Webserver, VM, etc. and Pacemaker itself doesn't directly control them, that's the Job of the Resource Agents. So a Resource Agent is like an init-script, but cluster-aware with more actions like start, stop, monitor, promote (to master) or migrate-to.
