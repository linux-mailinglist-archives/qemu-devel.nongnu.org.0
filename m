Richard, Philippe,

A commit message along the line that Philippe put together would be OK.

I can talk about this commit only - if other submaintainers are fine with
empty commit messages in key files for their target, that is their
business. I am certainly opposed to any empty commit messages in MIPS
files, and please, Richard, include a decent commit message for this
commit. I don't think I am asking much.

Thanks,
Aleksandar
