I think this is to switch into resuming mode, the data will follow

I think also:

0/0/1 --> 0/1/0 If user chooses to go directly to stop and copy

0/0/0 and 0/0/1 should be reachable from any state, though I could see
that a vendor driver could fail transition from 1/0/0 -> 0/0/1 if the
received state is incomplete.  Somehow though a user always needs to
return the device to the initial state, so how does device_state
interact with the reset ioctl?  Would this automatically manipulate
device_state back to 0/0/1?

I think we must unless we require the user to transition from 0/0/1 to
1/0/0 in a single operation, but I'd prefer to make 0/0/0 generally
available.  Thanks,
