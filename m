Hi,

Another option is to allow the user to pass along a DTB overlay with the
generic loader option (or with a separate option as Alistair suggested).
With overlways we wouldn't need all the command-line options to enable
construction of dtb fragments, it would be more or less transparent to
QEMU. There may be limitations with the overlay flows that I'm not aware
of though...

Cheers,
Edgar
