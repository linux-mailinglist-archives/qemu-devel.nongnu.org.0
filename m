If you want a good example for a real world use case where we could
improve things then I suggest looking at compilers.

They are frequently instantiated once per compilation unit and once done
all the JIT translations are thrown away. While the code-path taken by a
compiler may be different for every unit it compiles I bet there are
savings we could make by caching compilation. The first step would be
identifying how similar the profiles of the generated code generated is.
