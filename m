Well if you have an existing application that uses abstract sockets,
and you want to connect QEMU to it, then QEMU needs to support it,
or you are forced to interject a proxy between your app and QEMU
which is an extra point of failure and lantency. I was interested
in whether there was a specific application they were using, but
that is largely just from a curiosity POV. There's enough usage of
abstract sockets in apps in general that is it clearly a desirable
feature to enable.

Even if no external app is involved and you're just connecting
together 2 QEMU processes' chardevs, abstract sockets are interesting
because of their differing behaviour to non-abstract sockets.

Most notably non-abstract sockets are tied to the filesystem mount
namespace in Linux, where as abstract sockets are tied to the network
namespace. This is a useful distinction in the container world. Ordinarily
you can't connect QEMUs in 2 separate containers together, because they
always have distinct mount namespaces. There is often the ability to
share network namespaces between containers though, and thus unlock
use of abstract sockets for communications.
