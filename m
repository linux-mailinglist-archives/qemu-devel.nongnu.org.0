Calling it a "myth" from from that one data point is not really credible.

No language is perfect & such that it can eliminate all possible CVEs.
Rust *can*, however, eliminate a very large set of bugs which lead to=20
memory corruption in unchecked languages like C/C++.  You'll still have
CVEs to deal with, but they'll be different classes of bugs, or rare
edge cases like the one you show above.

Daniel
