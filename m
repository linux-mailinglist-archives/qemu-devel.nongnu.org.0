Old guests boot fine with the new WAET table.
We are running with this table in production for many years with many 
Windows XP guests (and much more esoteric guests)

Just to verify, I've just now run it with a WinXP SP3 VM and it works 
just fine.
So should I remove the flag completely or remain with the current 
functionality I have that makes sure WAET is only exposed on new 
machine-types?
