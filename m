Hmmm wait a second. The ARMv8 ARM says, about ID_ISAR0_EL1:

So this means that (aa32 && !arm_div) *does* conform to the architecture
manual! And then, I understand where the bug is.

As I wrote above, the current C expression stands for:

  aa32 --> arm_div

which -- we see from the ARMv8 ARM -- is wrong.

Upon re-reading the commit message more carefully:

    on a host that doesn't support aarch32 mode at all, neither arm_div
    nor jazelle will be supported either

it's clear that the intent was *not* the implication encoded in the
source. Instead, the intent was the *reverse* implication, namely:

  !aa32 --> !arm_div    [1]

Or, equivalently (because, (A --> B) =3D=3D=3D (!A --> !B)):

  arm_div --> aa32      [2]

Now, if you encode any one of these (equivalent) formulae in C, with the
logical OR operator, you get:

- Starting from [1]:

  (A     --> B)        =3D=3D=3D (!A   || B)
  (!aa32 --> !arm_div) =3D=3D=3D (aa32 || !arm_div) =3D=3D=3D (!no_aa32 |=
| !arm_div)

- Starting from [2]:

  (A       --> B)    =3D=3D=3D (!A       || B)
  (arm_div --> aa32) =3D=3D=3D (!arm_div || aa32) =3D=3D=3D (!arm_div || =
!no_aa32)

You can see that, regardless of whether we start with [1], or
equivalently, [2], we end up with the exact same predicate, logically
speaking. The final expressions only differ in C with regard to the
order of evaluation / shortcut behavior. We can pick whichever we prefer
(for whatever other reason).

FWIW, the language of the original commit message corresponds to [1].
So, if we want to stick with that, then the patch we need is:

If you guys agree, I can formally submit this patch.
