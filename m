The value simply is that in the future if www.devicetree.org is gone or 
the document is moved without redirect and the URL just gives you 404 or 
server not found then you can still know what the comment means if it says 
that according to OF PPC binding, Section 8.2.2. Initial Stack this should 
be the correct size. This is clear even when the URL is not available but 
with just the URL like above it's hard to verify if that case.
