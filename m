If all we need is a one-time seed then virtio-rng is possibly overkill as
that provides a continuous stream. Instead could QEMU read a few bytes
from the host's /dev/urandom and pass it to EDK via fw_cfg, which can
use it for the CSPRNG seed. EDK would have to erase the fw_cfg field
to prevent the seed value leaking to the guest OS, but other than that
its quite straightforward.
