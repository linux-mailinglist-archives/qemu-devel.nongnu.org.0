There have been quite a lot of QEMU-related talks at KVM Forum this
year - let's provide a summary for the people who could not attend.

 Note: For some talks it's hard to decide whether they really fit the
 QEMU blog or not. I've assembled the list below by quickly skimming
 through the schedule and the videos, and that's what I came up with ...
 If you think any of the other talks should be mentioned here, too,
 please let me know.
