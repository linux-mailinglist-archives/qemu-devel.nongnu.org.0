The "effective" value of an individual ZCR_ELx.LEN field is a bit
nonsensical: the effective vector length comes from the minimum
LEN value at any relevant EL (depending on which ELs are implemented,
which security state you're in, VHE controls etc.).

This is tedious to compute, so I'd expect you want to cache it,
recomputing it only when a ZCR_ELx.LEN changes or when you switch to a
different EL.


The architecture says:

"For all purposes other than returning the result of a direct read of
ZCR_EL1 then this field behaves as if it is set to the minimum of the
stored value and the constrained length inherited from more privileged
Exception levels in the current Security state, rounded down to the
nearest implemented vector length."

I think the behaviour of a direct read is implied: the LEN bits yielded
by an MRS should contain exactly what was last written to them via MSR.
