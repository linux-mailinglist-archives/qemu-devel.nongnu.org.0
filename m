We recently fixed bug #1696773 which was a cause of various crashes or
other problems when trying to run go binaries under linux-user,
including "go build hello.go". So I strongly suspect this is a duplicate
of that bug. Could you test with the QEMU v4.1.0 rc3 or later, please?

Title:
  go build fails under qemu-ppc64le-static (qemu-user)

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I am using qemu-user (built static) in a docker container environment.
  When running multi-threaded go commands in the container (go build for
  example) the process may hang, report segfaults or other errors.  I
  built qemu-ppc64le from the upstream git (master).

  I see the problem running on a multi core system with Intel i7 processors.
  # cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2760QM CPU @ 2.40GHz

  Steps to reproduce:
  1) Build qemu-ppc64le as static and copy into docker build directory name=
d it qemu-ppc64le-static.

  2) Add hello.go to docker build dir.

  package main
  import "fmt"
  func main() {
  	fmt.Println("hello world")
  }

  3) Create the Dockerfile from below:

  FROM ppc64le/golang:1.10.1-alpine3.
  COPY qemu-ppc64le-static /usr/bin/
  COPY hello.go /go

  4) Build container
  $ docker build -t qemutest -f Dockerfile ./go =


  5) Run test
  $ docker run -it qemutest

  ----
  Note the results may differ between attempts,  hangs and other faults som=
etimes happen.
  ----
  If I run "go: single threaded I don't see the problem, for example:

  /go # GOMAXPROCS=3D1 go build -p 1 hello.go =

  /go # ./hello
  hello world

  I see the same issue with arm64.  I don't think this is a go issue,
  but don't have a real evidence to prove that.  This problem looks
  similar to other problem I have seen reported against qemu running
  multi-threaded applications.
