I'm not sure what do you mean as this was about a memory leak in via-isa 
used only by PPC pegasos2 and MIPS fuloong2e machines. None of the 4xx 
machines are involved. Fixing this properly would ideally need changing 
the i8259 model which is also used by a lot of other non-PPC machines that 
I can't test and don't want to break so I just did what all other similar 
code calling i8259_init does. This was just found out with the via model 
but I think it's not specific to PPC.

That said there may be other unrelated clean up opportunities in the 4xx 
machines but this thread wasn't about that.
