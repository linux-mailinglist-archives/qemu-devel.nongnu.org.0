Which is a bug that=E2=80=99s been know for a long time, and the primary ca=
use
for the =E2=80=9CDeal with filters=E2=80=9D series.

One thing to note is that all user-creatable filter drivers currently
use =E2=80=9Cfile=E2=80=9D, so this would change them all.

The idea of just using backing for filters just always seems to me like
trying to take the easy way out.  It seems to me like many things around
filters are broken because we weren=E2=80=99t careful enough when introduci=
ng
them (mostly a combination of =E2=80=9Clet=E2=80=99s see whether it just wo=
rks=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cit
seems to mostly work=E2=80=9D), and the =E2=80=9CDeal with filters=E2=80=9D=
 series attempts to
rectify that.  As evidenced by the reviews that required even more
preliminary work (like the still on-list and under-discussion
BdrvChildRole series), there is really a ton of design that should be
improved.

That makes me very hesitant to just switch filters over to backing,
because I feel that might alleviate some of the most pressing symptoms,
while not addressing the underlying issues.  And without symptoms that
hurt, nobody might want to fix the issues.  Basically, it feels like
more of the same =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s try whether it mostly works=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Cit seems to
mostly work=E2=80=9D.

(Also, my na=C3=AFve feeling is that if just treating backing and file the
same for filter drivers, the deal with filters series would be ten
patches long and v1 would have been uncontroversial.)
