Most of that could be done without jackd restart, but yeah I got your point. 
Thanks!

Agreed.

I look at your v5 a bit later.

Surpring that you never checked the min. latency there, as you nailed quite an 
ambitous jack driver into QEMU which I just realize now. Must have been 
splipped my awareness due to traffic.

Of course! :) I was shaking my head when distros started to pick PulseAudio as 
standard sound server. I never got that decision as JACK was always way 
superior than PA.

Probably the only issue for consumer use cases is JACK's habit to kick 
unreliable clients out of the graph. Even though this could be handled of 
course.

Yeah, looks good indeed!

Yeah, I raised my voice there as well now.
