We actually have documentation what it means:

 * BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED: the content of the block is determined by this
 *                       layer rather than any backing, set by block layer

Say we have a short overlay, like this:

base.qcow2:     AAAAAAAA
overlay.qcow2:  BBBB

Then of course the content of block 5 (the one after EOF of
overlay.qcow2) is still determined by overlay.qcow2, which can be easily
verified by reading it from overlay.qcow2 (produces zeros) and from
base.qcow2 (produces As).

So the correct result when querying the block status of block 5 on
overlay.qcow2 is BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED | BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO.

Interestingly, we already fixed the opposite case (large overlay over
short backing file) in commit e88ae2264d9 from May 2014 according to the
same logic.

I agree it's a bug.

Your fix doesn't look right to me, though. You leave the buggy behaviour
of bdrv_co_block_status() as it is and then add four patches to work
around it in some (but not all) callers of it.

All that it should take to fix this is making the bs->backing check
independent from want_zero and let it set ALLOCATED. What I expected
would be something like the below patch.

But it doesn't seem to fully fix the problem (though 'alloc 1M 1M' in
qemu-io shows that the range is now considered allocated), so probably
there is still a separate bug in bdrv_is_allocated_above().

And I think we'll want an iotests case for both cases (short overlay,
short backing file).
