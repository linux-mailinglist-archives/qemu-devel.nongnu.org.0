Mostly I just wanted to formalize mypy, pylint, flake8 et al across the
most important python bits in our tree so that when making changes for
testing it's easier to verify that I didn't break something else.

Easiest way to get the right structure that these tools expect is to
make a real package ...

So here we are. And also Philippe asked nicely.

It's not (from my POV) very complex to do a namespace. I have some plans
to move e.g. qapi into qemu.qapi, and some of our other tools into
qemu.tools.

Some of these packages can be published externally, some can remain in
the tree.

but -- maybe namespaces ARE complicating matters in ways I don't
understand yet. I'll be open about it. The thought was mostly about
keeping flexibility with just installing the bits and pieces that you
want/need.

whether a venv or a user installation, it's the same thing, really: the
user needs to set up and be in that environment to use the python tools
in the tree.

Once we're there, we may as well formalize the VENV to make it easier to
set up and use.

Ah, yeah. If we're going this far, I'd prefer using a VENV over
modifying the user's environment. That way you can blast it all away
with a `make distclean`.

Maybe the "make develop" target could even use the presence of a .venv
directory to know when it needs to make the environment or not ...

Joking nitpick: There is no intended way to use Python! :)

Still, the sys.path hacks -- worse than being "unpythonic", actively
seem to get in the way of pylint, flake8, mypy et al which do provide us
with legitimate and serious value.

So, sad to say, but we might lose the ability to run these python
scripts ad-hoc out of the tree (with no setup) in order to gain a more
robust python CI regime.

I think it's a fair trade-off, but we'll see if that's born out in review.

I am proposing only that we use semver to track the API version of the
SDK itself.

So that could be:

A) 1.x, 2.x, 3.x (etc) with absolutely no connection to the intended
QEMU support version. It either works or it doesn't. It might not work
very spectacularly. Major semver bumps indicate a breaking change to the
library API.

B) 1.5.0.0, 1.5.1.0, 1.5.2.0 (etc) where the major version still
describes the API, but the remainder of the version describes the
intended target QEMU.

Or, we could do:

C) 5.0.0, 5.1.0, 5.2.0, etc. where it tracks the QEMU version verbatim,
end of story.


I don't like (C) very much, because it violates some prevailing idioms
about python package versioning. A or B seem better, but do run us into
potential trouble with people having mismatched versions.

I'd take A or B. (B) is a little chatty but gives some good information
and allows you to pin versions effectively, so I think I'm leaning
towards that one right now.

Well, whatever we do right now, I think I do really want to make sure we
are publishing under 0.x to really give the illustration that we are NOT
promising even the illusion of stability right now.

I tried to make note to the develop case in several places; for the
purposes of this email I wanted to demonstrate what installing and using
it as a user would look like.

For those unaware of the distinction:

- install does a real bona-fide installation.
- develop installs a forwarder package that references the living
development files, so the package contents (but NOT its metadata!) are
always up to date with your development files.

For QEMU developers, installing with develop is going to be the smart
way to go. When your git tree is updated, your package will be updated
along with it. You can do it once and then probably forget about it.
