as far as we have cpu_class_by_name, we have to watch over that
new patches/targets won't add some custom handling/fallbac/whatnot.

On contrary -device works just with type names for all devices,
applying the same to -cpu which is basically translator
   model->type[,-global type.foo,...]
would be consistent with -device and less confusing for everyone
(not counting significant code reduction).
It would certainly simplify contributing new targets as contributor
won't have to care about cpu model naming and do something about it.

This option wasn't considered before because we didn't have deprecation
back then, but now it opens possibility to simplify qemu and consolidate
naming. (we probably would be able to fold '-cpu help' into '-device help'
as well).
