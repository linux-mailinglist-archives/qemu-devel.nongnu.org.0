It's a property of the exported object, but I guess it doesn't really
correspond to any concrete field. I'll remove \field.

The uuid can be passed to a second device controlled by a different
driver, so I think 'driver' by itself is ambiguous. I'm using guest as
a shorthand for 'system which includes the drivers and software which
sits on top of the drivers', and that meaning does seem to be
compatible with language in the rest of the spec. If that shorthand
isn't acceptable, I can rewrite the sentence passively as '... a uuid
which can then be passed to a second device ...'.

> Also - what are guest and host here?

There are a number of places in the virtio spec where 'guest' is used
to refer to the system where drivers run and where 'host' is used to
refer to the system where devices run. I guess those terms aren't
concretely defined within the spec, but they do seem to have a well
understood meaning. Or is the guest/host language discouraged in new
additions to the spec?
