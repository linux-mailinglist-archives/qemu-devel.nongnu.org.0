That's true, I always forget about .. (though you'd still have to add
Some() for now-optional fields).

Yes, for some APIs you can always add hand-written, more idiomatic
versions.  Or you could mark them as fixed-arguments in the schema and
let the code generator do that (but then you need to add a compatibility
check).  But that would be an explicit choice, not something required by
the transport.

No, only tries to be a good network RPC; not a particularly efficient
one, but future-proof.  And it mostly succeeds at that---with one
notable exception: JSON parsers that mess up with numbers bigger than 2^53.

Marc-André, we are totally in agreement about that!  The problem is that
you have already decided what the solution looks like, and that's what
I'm not sure about because your solution also implies completely
revisiting the schema.

I say there are many candidates (the ones I know are Protobuf and
Flexbuffers) for serialization and many candidates for transport (REST
and gRPC to begin with) in addition to the two {QMP,JSON} and
{DBus,DBus} tuples.  We should at least look at how they do code
generation before deciding that JSON is bad and DBus is good.

Problem is, "more careful consideration when making changes" is not a
small thing.  And other RPCs have evolved in a completely different
space (REST APIs for web services) that have chosen the same tradeoffs
as QMP, so why should we not learn from them?
