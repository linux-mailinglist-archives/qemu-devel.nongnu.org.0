IIUC, we're grouping together all users of a specific mdev_type, but
support a variety of sub-configurations? Does that include parameters
or not? If not, shouldn't we already be covered by mdev_type?

I'm trying to figure out what that means for the mdevs I'm most
familiar with, ccw and ap. Both of them currently support a single
mdev_type.

For ccw, there are some things that I could imagine as parameters, like
the device number, or channel paths. Maybe we could include the channel
path type (FICON, ...) in the migration device model? We should not
include device numbers etc. in the device model.

For ap, we have matrices covering tuples (APQNs) derived from a
cross-product of card/domains configure via sysfs attributes. I think
later modification of these is desired. I think we also might be able
to mix-and-match different types within the same matrix, so not sure if
we can put these into any device model. In fact, I'm a bit at a loss
how the device model for ap would look like (other than simply
'matrix'). Can we deal with dynamic parameters?
