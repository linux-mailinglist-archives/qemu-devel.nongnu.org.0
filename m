Should we include a version number on experimental versions?

LLVM requires users to fully specify the version, when using
experimental versions.
This may be a useful stereotype also for QEmu, as it ensures that
users are aware that the underlying specification version has changed
(e.g., when someone requests x-zbb-0p92 and our implementation moves
to x-zbb-0p93 (there was a difference in encoding of the
minimum/maximum operations in-between)), an error will be raised early
instead of having a computation go wrong later.
