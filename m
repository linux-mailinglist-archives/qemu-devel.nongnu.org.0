Hmm this should work.. Still it's a workaround, seems out of the concept of permission system..

I think, that the problem is that .bdrv_top_child_perm can't return an error.
The handler answers the question:

- Hi, we are your owners and we want the following cumulative permissions on you. Then, which permissions do you want on your child?

And the handler can't answer: "Hi, you guys want too much, I refuse to play by your rules"..
