To put this in context for other people reading, virt-v2v uses this
sort of situation:

<pre>

                          |                                  |

  | server     |            |          |        |          |

             VMware proprietary      NBD over Unix skt
             protocol over TCP
</pre>

The problem being addressed is that the whole task can run for many
hours, and a single interruption in the network between virt-v2v and
the remote VMware server can cause the entire process to fail.
nbdkit-retry-filter[0] attempts to address the problem by allowing the
VMware side of the protocol to be restarted without qemu-img seeing
any interruption (nor any error) on the NBD connection.

Note that of the three nbdkit plugins we currently use (vddk[1], curl
and ssh) at least two of them have the property that closing and
reopening the plugin handle (which is what nbdkit-retry-filter does)
reconnects to the remote server.  To take nbdkit-ssh-plugin as a
specific example[2], the .open callback calls ssh_connect() and the
.close callback calls ssh_disconnect().  VDDK works the same way.  I'm
a bit unclear on nbdkit-curl-plugin because IIRC underlying HTTPS
connections may be managed in a pool inside Curl.

I get that this is different from the retry filter, but isn't this
just working around behaviour in qemu's NBD client?  Couldn't qemu's
NBD client be changed to reconnect on EIO?  Or retry?  (Optionally of
course, and this would be orthogonal the current patch.)

We'd certainly need a new nbdkit_* API, rather like the way we added
nbdkit_shutdown to make nbdkit-exitlast-filter possible.  However I'm
still unclear if the new filter's behaviour would be necessary.
