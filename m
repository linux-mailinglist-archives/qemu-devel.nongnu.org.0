Yes we can fix that, but I'm still not sure whether changing the
interface of address_space_get_iotlb_entry() to cover adhoc regions is
a good idea, because I think it's still a memory core API and imho it
would still be good to have IOTLBs returned to be what the hardware
will be using (always page aligned IOTLBs).  Also it would still be
not ideal because vhost backend will still need to send the MISSING
messages and block for each of the continuous guest memory ranges
registered, so there will still be misterious delay.  Not to say
logically all the caches can be invalidated too so in that sense I
think it's as hacky as the vhost speedup patch mentioned below..

Ideally I think vhost should be able to know when PT is enabled or
disabled for the device, so the vhost backend (kernel or userspace)
should be able to directly use GPA for DMA.  That might need some new
vhost interface.

For the s390's specific issue, I would think Jason's patch an simple
and ideal solution already.

Thanks,
