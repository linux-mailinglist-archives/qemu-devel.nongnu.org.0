How does "host" work for TCG on x86?

We seem to have a disagreement here about what 'max' is intended
for and what its semantics for. That seems unfortunate...

For Arm, "max" is absolutely something we want to expose to
end users. It's the easiest way for a user to say "give me
something that's going to work". "host" doesn't work on TCG,
only with KVM.

No, definitely not. Experimental features should never be
enabled by default -- the user must explicitly opt into them
so they are aware that they're using something that might
change behaviour or go away in a future QEMU version.

Also, from my point of view "max" is not for the benefit
of management software in particular. It's a convenience
for users primarily (and also for management software if
it doesn't want to care whether it's running KVM or TCG).

If management software wants a way to ask "what features
might be valid" we should provide them with one which
doesn't require those features to be enabled-by-default
in the 'max' CPU.
