Widening the integer property sounds good to me. I just hadn't thought of
it (implementation tunnel vision affecting my user interface design).
Andrea also mentioned that as a possibility in a reply to the series. I
think we can leave the property as a uint64_t right now and then, when/if
it needs to expand past 64 bits we can change the property to a string
and start parsing arbitrarily large integers from it. The internal state,
'uint64_t sve_vls_map' can easily be changed to a 'uint64_t sve_vls_map[]'
at that point too. How's that sound?

The 'not usable with -cpu host' was a choice, not a limitation to deal
with. The problem with sve-max-vq is that it doesn't provide enough
information by itself. Multiple vector sets with the same max-vq can be
valid. For migration of KVM guests the exact set needs to be explicitly
requested to ensure the host supports it. For TCG it may be nice to
model sets besides the everything up to max-vq set that sve-max-vq would
choose. sve-max-vq could be used with -cpu host the same way I've
implemented it for -cpu max, which is to take the fully supported vector
set from the KVM query and use that one, but I didn't want to encourage
its use with AArch64's primary KVM cpu type (even if it's -cpu host and
thus not a great choice for migration anyway).

Thanks,
