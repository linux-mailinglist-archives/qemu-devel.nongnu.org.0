Aleksandar, your message is hard to read, because you sent Content-Type:
multipart/alternative, and both the test/html and the test/plain
alternative ride roughshot over the quoted text's line structure.
Quoted patches become unreadable garbage.  Please check your e-mail
setup.

I take that as a "no".

The preferences of "many" (whoever they may be) are a lot less relevant
than the specific project's prevailing style.  "git-grep ' case .*/\*'"
shows thousands of hits.

If you want to pursue this change, please put it in a separate patch,
so this one is really about fixing "errors and warnings reported by
'checkpatch.pl -f'", as your commit message promises.

Please tone down the aggression a notch.

Philippe merely observed a trade-off.  We deal with such trade-offs all
the time.  When your reviewer challenges one, you consider it (unless
you did that already), then tell him what you concluded.

"Tu quoque" is not a proper reply to such an observation (or to anything
else for that matter).  When you have an issue with Philippe's patches,
address it in review of Philippe's patches.

Thank you.
