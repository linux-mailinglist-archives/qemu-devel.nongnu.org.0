Thanks a lot Alex for your review.

If I can leverage your TCG knowledge a bit more, as I forgot a lot about it,

have you noticed in "i386: split tcg btp_helper into softmmu and user parts"
and "i386: split smm helper (softmmu)"

those new

#ifndef CONFIG_USER_ONLY?

Basically we remove some preamble stuff that would end up calling empty stubs for user mode,
but do you think there could be some other consequence I am not seeing?

Maybe there is even more that could be removed in the code immediately preceding those CONFIG_USER_ONLY?

In particular I am referring to patches:

  i386: split tcg btp_helper into softmmu and user parts
  i386: split smm helper (softmmu)

I am commenting those patches now inline, so that it is easier to see what I am talking about.

Again, thanks a lot!

Claudio
