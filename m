I feel a bit bad about it not being an implicit node.  But I know you

and because
libvirt doesn=E2=80=99t use backup (yet), probably nobody cares.

Reasonable, even more so as I suppose BCS.source should eventually be a
BdrvChild of backup-top.

What looks wrong is that the sync_bitmap is created on the source (=E2=80=
=9Cbs=E2=80=9D
in backup_job_create()), but backup_cleanup_sync_bitmap() still assumes
it is on blk_bs(job->common.blk) (which is no longer true).

Well, but the op blocker belongs to the source, which should be covered
by internal permissions.  The fact that it now shows up as a file-posix
error thus shows that the conflict also moves from the source to the
target.  It=E2=80=99s OK because we actually don=E2=80=99t have a conflic=
t on the source.

But I wonder whether it would be better for test_dismiss_collision() to
do a blockdev-backup instead where we can see the collision on the target=
=2E

Hm.  On second thought, why do we even get a conflict on the target?
block-copy does share the WRITE permission for it...

Nice.

I don=E2=80=99t have much to object (for some reason, I feel a bit uneasy=
 about
dropping all the request waiting code, but I suppose that is indeed
taken care of with the range locks now).

This order is weird because backup-top still has a pointer to the BCS,
but we have already freed it at this point.

Which is OK because backup-top does not share the WRITE permission.  But
it is organized a bit weirdly, because it=E2=80=99s actually block-copy h=
ere
that relies on the WRITE permission not to be shared; which it itself
cannot do because backup-top needs it.

This of course results from the fact that backup-top and block-copy
should really use the same object to access the source, namely the
backing BdrvChild of backup-top.

Maybe there should be a comment somewhere that points this out?

I feel like it would still be simpler to keep the separate fail path and
just duplicate the bdrv_co_unlock(lock) call.

Is this guaranteed to be NULL when not specified by the user?
