See below, making this work on the hypervisor side would be much cleaner
IMHO, but most probably not possible due to guest integrity.

FWIW, "Free page reporting" will (never) work with PV, where there is
basically no manual "deflation" step anymore.

Well, it is mostly architecture independent until now ...

SEV even pins all guest memory, so it's useless and would be even
dangerous to use.


Some thoughts:


1. I would really prefer if there is a way to zero-out+share a page and
zero-out+unshare a page triggered by the hypervisor. Then only the
hypervisor has to do "the right thing" when
inflating/deflating/rebooting etc. I know we can "unshare all" via the
UV - we e.g., have to do that on reboots. But I assume this might mess
with "guest integrity" (being able to zero out random guest pages
technically) and is therefore not possible.


2. Have some other way to communicate "careful, ballooning won't work".
E.g., the guest detecting *itself* that it is running inside a PV
environment and not loading virtio-balloon until it properly
shares/unshares. Again, piggy-backing on IOMMU/VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
somehow feels wrong.


E.g., once you would support inflation/deflation in virtio-balloon, free
page reporting could not be supported. So it's more than just a single
arch specific inflation/deflation callback.


And virtio-mem [1] will have similar issues once we want to use that on
s390x. But there, an arch-specific share/unshare callback should be
sufficient most probably. Still, there would have to be a way to block
it on s390x PV until implemented. Ideally it will be the same as for
virtio-balloon.

Again, being able to do that in the hypervisor instead of in the guest
would be much cleaner.
