I was thinking about that myself.  It isn=E2=80=99t that bad, because you=
 aren=E2=80=99t
doing the full block_status dance but just checking allocation status,
which is reasonably quick (it just needs to look at the image format
metadata, it doesn=E2=80=99t go down to the protocol layer).

But it=E2=80=99s probably not so good to halt the monitor for this, yes.

Before that event, the bitmap can still be usable, as long as all
=E2=80=9Cunknown=E2=80=9D areas are set to dirty.  Sure, your resumed bac=
kup will then
copy too much data.  But who cares.

So I don=E2=80=99t think you even need an event.

Yes, that was my first idea, too.  But I didn=E2=80=99t even write about =
it,
because of...

=2E..exactly this.

I don=E2=80=99t think it=E2=80=99s all that bad.
