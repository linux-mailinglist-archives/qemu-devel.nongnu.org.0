Yes, the second patch introduced the input ring buffer to store remaining
bytes while monitor is suspended.

QMP input scheme:
1. monitor_qmp_can_read returns a number of bytes, which it's ready to receive.
   Currently it returns 0 (if suspended) or 1 otherwise.
   In my patch: monitor_qmp_can_read returns a free size of the introduced
   ring buffer.

2. monitor_qmp_read receives and handles input bytes
   Currently it just puts received bytes into a json lexer.
   If monitor is suspended this function won't be called and thus it won't
   process new command until monitor resume.
   In my patch: monitor_qmp_read stores input bytes into the buffer and then
   handles bytes in the buffer one by one while monitor is not suspended.
   So, it allows to be sure that the original logic is preserved and
   we won't handle new commands while monitor is suspended.

3. monitor_resume schedules monitor_accept_input which calls
   monitor_qmp_handle_inbuf which tries to handle remaining bytes
   in the buffer. monitor_accept_input is a BH scheduled by monitor_resume
   on monitor's aio context. It is needed to be sure, that we access
   the input buffer only in monitor's context.

Example:
1. QMP read 100 bytes
2. Handle some command in the first 60 bytes
3. For some reason, monitor becomes suspended after the first command
4. 40 bytes are remaining
5. After a while, something calls monitor_resume which handles
   the remaining bytes in the buffer (implicitly: resume -> sched bh -> buf)

Actually, QMP continues to receive data even though the monitor is suspended
until the buffer is full. But it doesn't process received data.

Regards,
Yury
