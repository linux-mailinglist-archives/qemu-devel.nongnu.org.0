This isn't using the normal DBus instance. It needs a new isntance of
dbus-daemon to be spawned for each VM IIUC.

There's two distinct aspects here

 - Whether to use a bus vs peer-to-peer
 - What protocol to run over the wire

DBus defines a low level wire protocol. It just happens that it is
commonly used in bus topology, but it is fine being used peer-to-peer
instead.

IOW, we could use Dbus as the wire encoding, and still have a direct
FD betwwen QEMU & the helper program, without needign dbus-daemon
present.

IIRC, that's the default DBus message size limit. You can choose to
raise that in the client & server impl if desired, or alternatively
just pass back a memfd() handle with the DBus relpy, over which to
access the bulk data out of band.
