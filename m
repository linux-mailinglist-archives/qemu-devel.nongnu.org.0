You used to be able to load the "bios" etc and follow the boot flow [0].
This no longer works, and has not for at least a year. I assume it still
works if you check out the (fossilised) versions mentioned in that doc.
Think I said it last time I sent patches, but we had some floating around
internally that I know /did/ work at some point about this time last year
but I was never able to figure out the correct alignment of the stars to
get working myself. It required pretty decent changes to the sdhci driver,
which, I'm hoping cease to be required with the v2022.10 reference
design that I mentioned else where in this patch.
But one problem at a time ;)

I just copy pasted what was already here. Follow on patch for the
conversions since most of what's in this file is effectively
unimplemented?
