Thanks for your review.

The system headers bits/mman.h (which is included by sys/mman.h)

don't define MAP_SYNC and MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE on linux.

They're defined in linux-headers/asm-generic/mman-common.h ( which is 
included by linux/mman.h).

Another MAP_* macros are defined in both header files.

As you mentioned, if don't include linux/mman.h, just defines as following:

#ifndef MAP_SYNC
#define MAP_SYNC 0
#endif

The MAP_SYNC is always 0 since MAP_SYNC isn't defined in system header.

Thanks,

Jingqi
