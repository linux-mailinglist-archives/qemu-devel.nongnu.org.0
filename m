v4:
- improve the code left and right
- use the MIGRATION_FLAG_SYNC
- use qerrors properly
- pass errors everywhere (no more printfs)
- create cleanup/save operations
- merged zlib patches into one
- general patches alreody on the migration pull request.
- commented all the methods.

ToDo: Didn't add the sztd compression because I changed the zlib
      code/methods quite a bit.
      My understanding is that all the issues are gone.

v3:
- improve the code
- address David and Markus comments
- make compression code into methods
  so we can add any other method ading just three functions

Please review, as far as I know everything is ok now.

Todo: Add zstd support

v2:
- improve the code left and right
- Split better the zlib code
- rename everything to v4.1
- Add tests for multifd-compress zlib
- Parameter is now an enum (soon will see sztd)

ToDo:
- Make operations for diferent methods:
  * multifd_prepare_send_none/zlib
  * multifd_send_none/zlib
  * multifd_recv_none/zlib
- Use the MULTIFD_FLAG_ZLIB (it is unused so far).

Please review and comment.

v1:

This series create compression code on top of multifd.  It is still
WIP, but it is already:
- faster that current compression code
- it does the minimum amount of copies possible
- we allow support for other compression codes
- it pass the multifd test sent in my previous series

Test for existing code didn't work because code is too slow, I need to
make downtime 10 times bigger to make it to converge on my test
machine.  This code works with same limits that multifd no-

ToDo:
- move printf's  to traces
- move code to a struct instead of if (zlib) inside the main threads.
- improve error handling.

Please, review and coment.

Juan Quintela (6):
  migration-test: introduce functions to handle string parameters
  migration: Make multifd_save_setup() get an Error parameter
  migration: Make multifd_load_setup() get an Error parameter
  migration: Add multifd-compress parameter
  migration: Make no compression operations into its own structure
  migration: Add zlib compression multifd support
