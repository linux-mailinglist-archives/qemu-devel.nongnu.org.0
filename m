We should be careful with config files, because the configuration parser 
can become a real mess. There are 2 kinds of config files:

1. Imperative: an equivalent of QAPI/QMP command script. (eg like CLI 
config files Markus proposed). These are easy to handle because they 
follow the QMP flow. We do one command after the other, the ordering of 
tasks is clear.

2. Descriptive: A description of the configuration where we describe the 
components and the wiring. This can be really complicated because we 
easily end up with ordering/determinism issues when instantiating them 
afterwards. For example the  configuration parser may have to solve : 
Which device do I create first ? I don't think a configuration parser 
should have to solve such issues, but I'm not sure if we can avoid it.
