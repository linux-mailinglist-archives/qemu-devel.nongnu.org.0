Really appreciated that you re-start this work.

I tested your branch and some update.

Guest: https://github.com/Linaro/linux-kernel-warpdrive/tree/sva-devel 
<https://github.com/Linaro/linux-kernel-warpdrive/tree/sva-devel>
Host: 
https://github.com/eauger/linux/tree/will-arm-smmu-updates-2stage-v10 
<https://github.com/eauger/linux/tree/will-arm-smmu-updates-2stage-v10>
qemu: https://github.com/eauger/qemu/tree/v4.2.0-2stage-rfcv6 
<https://github.com/eauger/qemu/tree/v4.2.0-2stage-rfcv6>

The guest I am using is contains Jean's sva patches.
Since currently they are many patch conflict, so use two different tree.

Result
No-sva mode works.
This mode, guest directly get physical address via ioctl.

While vSVA can not work, there are still much work to do.
I am trying to SVA mode, and it fails, so choose no-sva instead.
iommu_dev_enable_feature(parent, IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA)

I am in debugging how to enable this.

Thanks
