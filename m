From: Thomas Huth <thuth@redhat.com>

The output of qemu-io changed recently - most tests have been fixed in
commit 36b9986b08787019ef42 ("tests/qemu-iotests: Fix output of qemu-io
related tests") already, but a qcow1, vmdk, and nbd test were still missi=
ng.

Fixes: 99e98d7c9fc1a1639fad ("qemu-io: Use error_[gs]et_progname()")
