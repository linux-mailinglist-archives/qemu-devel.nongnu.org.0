Can you please provide clear and exact reproduction instructions and
binaries for whatever the bugs you think you're seeing are? Bear in mind
that I know nothing at all about your guest binary or how it is supposed
to behave, and I am not going to build versions of your binary from
source. If I need to look at things via the gdb interface, give exact
sequences of gdb commands I need to use to reproduce the behaviour and
say what you were expecting the behaviour to be.

Title:
  qemu-system-aarch64: regression: TCG sometimes using wrong values for
  VBAR_EL2 despite it being correctly reported to GDB

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Affects 3.1.0 (latest stable release) and latest commit
  (893dc8300c80e3dc32f31e968cf7aa0904da50c3) but did *not* affect 2.11
  (qemu from bionic ubuntu LTS).

  With the following code and shell commands:

  test.s:

  .text
  mov x0, #0x60000000
  msr vbar_el2, x0
  dsb sy
  isb sy

  $ aarch64-none-elf-as test.s -o test.o
  $ aarch64-none-elf-objcopy -S -O binary test.o test.bin
  $ qemu-system-aarch64 -nographic -machine virt,virtualization=3Don -cpu c=
ortex-a57 -kernel test.bin -s -S

  vbar_el2 is still 0 after the code, instead of being the expected
  0x60000000. (see screenshot).

  This regression doesn't seem to happen for vbar_el1 &
  virtualization=3Doff.
