The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  [feature request] bind nat (-net user) to other interface (like
  eth0:2)

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  -net user mode is very nice because it does not require any changes in
  host system. However if host system has muplitple IPs You cant use it,
  or even switch to another. Qemu should be able to "bind" to eth0:1
  eth0:2 so that outgoing traffic uses this interface and thus other IP.
