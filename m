ARM KVM guests must be run with CPU host passthrough. This means the
host hardware and host kernel versions must be identical in order
to guarantee successful migrations.

That said, upgrading the host kernel without shutting down the guests
is a reasonable thing to try. Unfortunately, in this case, the only
way to do it would be to hack QEMU on the destination to allow this
extra register in KVM_GET_REG_LIST. It should be harmless, as it's
not used. Allowing it is similar to allowing the destination to have
a larger number of registers than the source in KVM_GET_REG_LIST (which
is why the failing test is <=, not ==).

I wouldn't post a real patch to resolve this issue, though, as everything
is working as expected. The failing test is failing because it detected
a risky migration. And, KVM's filtering of registers from KVM_GET_REG_LIST
is also correct, even if previous KVM versions didn't do that. With CPU
models you could request the reg list for a particular model and expect
it to be the same across all kernel versions that support it, but we
don't have those.

Thanks,
drew
