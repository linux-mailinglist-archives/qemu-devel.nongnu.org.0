Having qemu accept signed ints in place of large unsigned values is easy
enough. But you are right that it loses precision when doubles are
involved on the receiving end, and we cross the 2^53 barrier.

Particularly ugly as we turn 1<<55 from:

"value":36028797018963968

into

"value":[8388608,0]

and now both qemu and the client end have to agree that an array of two
integers is a valid replacement for any larger 64-bit quantity
(presumably, we'd always accept the array form even for small integer
values, but only produce the array form for large values).  And while it
manages just fine for uint64_t values, what rules would you place on
int64_t values? That the resulting 2-integer array is combined with the
first number as a 2's-complement signed value, and the second being a
32-bit unsigned value?

But less so than option 2.

"value":36028797018963968

vs.

"value":"36028797018963968"

is at least tolerable.

If we're going to negotiate something, I'd lean towards option 3
(anywhere the introspection states that we accept 'int64' or similar, it
is also appropriate to send a string value in its place). We'd also have
to decide if we want to allow "0xabcd", or strictly insist on 43981,
when stringizing an integer.  And while qemu should accept a string or a
number on input, we'd still have to decide/document whether it's
response to the client capability negotiation is to output a string
always, or only for values larger than the 2^53 threshold.

JSON requires decimal-only, but I'm okay if we state that when
negotiating the alternative representation, that we output hex-only.
(JSON5 adds hex support among other things, but it is not an RFC
standard, and even fewer libraries exist that parse JSON5 in addition to
straight JSON).

Same here.

Likewise - if we're going to bother with a capability that changes
output and allows the input validators to accept more forms, I'd prefer
a string form with correct sign over a negative integer that depends on
64-bit 2's-complement arithmetic to intepret correctly.
