I think the CC list is too short for this question. We should involve
the XFS people here.

Vladimir also said that qcow2 subclusters would probably also solve his
problem, so maybe reverting and applying the subcluster patches instead
is a possible solution, too?

We already have some cases where the existing handle_alloc_space()
causes performance to actually become worse, and serialising requests as
a workaround isn't going to make performance any better. So even on
these grounds, keeping commit c8bb23cbdbe32f is questionable.
