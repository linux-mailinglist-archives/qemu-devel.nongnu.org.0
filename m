I use this fairly often as its a useful debugging / experimentation
/ trouble shooting tool. There's similar ish functionality in
virsh qemu-monitor-command. I think there's scope of a supported
tool here that can talk to libvirt or a UNIX socket for doing
QMP commands, with a friendlier syntax & pretty printing.=20

In libvirt we've got this kind of problem already and have two different
approaches to tackling it.

For the really complex cases with lots of conceptual nesting, we would
end up using XML.

For the simpler case where its just a set of flat parameters, we have
something we call "virTypedParameters" which is effectively a poor man's
hash table where the keys are parameter names, and the values are a
union accepting different types.

In the Go APIs for libvirt though we end up mapping both those approaches
into Go structs. The key reason why we are able todo this in Go and not
C, is that we don't promise ABI compat in Go bindings. We'll extend the
structs at will, and some times a struct field gets turned into a nested
struct which is an API break too. With Go apps typically bundle all their
3rd party deps & often lock themselves to a specific release tag, so they
don't need ABI compat in the same way apps want at C level.

I think we need to re-think how we're attacking this problem, because
despite heroic efforts in developing QAPI & converting code it use it,
we've still not got the finish line in sight after 10 years.

As I mentioned in my other reply I think we should target the CLI as
something exclusively for humans, with convenient syntax and more
relaxed back compat requirements. ie don't guarantee perfect back
compat for the CLI - just modest effor to not gratuitously break it
without cause. Humans using the CLI can adapt if they hit obscure
quirks.

Our back compat pain with the quirks is because we have mgmt apps using
the CLI which can't tolerate semantic changes without warning. We can't
be more relaxed with CLI back compat without getting mgmt apps away
from using this CLI.  We can get mgmt apps off using the CLI until they
have an alternative they can use.

The hard part is that developing the QAPI alternative is that its impl
might accidentaly cause breakage in existing CLI before mgmt apps can
switch to the QAPI based approach.



I'm wondering if we need to think about a temporary *throwaway* fork of
QEMU. I wasn't involved in the work, but as an outside observer I think
it is interesting to see how the NEMU project fork ultimately led to QEMU
moving forward with a new KConfig approach, and the integration of microvm.
They had the freedom to develop these new approaches with zero regard
to back compat or broader QEMU needs that might otherwise hold back dev.
Once the forked impl was mostly done, "unknown problems" had largely become
"known problems", and the work could be integrated back into QEMU with
much less risk of disruption.


Could such a temporary fork approach help us solve the QAPI-ification
end goal ?  It doesn't have to be a separate project - it could be a
temporary qemu-qapi.git on qemu-project.org or github for experimentation,
but still under umbrealla of QEMU.

It would free us to implement an idealized 100% QAPI-ified config
approach in the shortest possible time, with zero regard to back
compat of the current CLI.

We could develop support for this in libvirt in parallel, letting
us test the combination to gain confidence in the result.

Essentially we'll be aiming to flush out all the "unknown problems"
that hold us back today. As we get confidence we'll be able to merge
it back into QEMU proper with much lower risk of introducing suprising
compat problems.

At some level you can consider each subsys maintainer's branch a fork,
but those branches are really focused on stable code that's ready to
merge. An NEMU like fork is more aggressive than that, as it provided
a focused place for *experimentation* with no regard for immediate
merge to GIT master. The cost of such a fork approach of course is
that of trying to keep up2date with development in QEMU git master.

The benefit of being able to cut the back-compat knot might still
make this a win, allowing completion of QAPI-ification in a faster
timeframe.

Daniel
