It is perfectly reasonable to check flags in this method.

Yes, this method is already taking an ERror **errp parameter and
reporting a user facing error. If we need to report different
message text for ENOBUFS, it should be done in this method too.

The reason QIO_CHANNEL_ERR_BLOCK is special is because we are
explicitly not treating it as an error scenario at all.  That's
different to the ENOBUFS case.

Now that I'm looking again, we should not really use poll() at all,
as GLib provides us higher level APIs. We in fact already have the
qio_channel_wait() method as a general purpose helper for waiting
for an I/O condition to occur.;

Sure, we could do   "ret > 0 == number of buffers that were copied"
as the API contract, rather than just treating it as a boolean.
