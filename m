This series adds a new "BITMAP" sync mode that is meant to replace the
existing "INCREMENTAL" sync mode.

This mode can have its behavior modified by issuing any of three bitmap s=
ync
modes, passed as arguments to the job.

The three bitmap sync modes are:
- CONDITIONAL: This is an alias for the old incremental mode. The bitmap =
is
               conditionally synchronized based on the return code of the=
 job
               upon completion.
- NEVER: This is, effectively, the differential backup mode. It never cle=
ars
         the bitmap, as the name suggests.
- ALWAYS: Here is the new, exciting thing. The bitmap is always synchroni=
zed,
          even on failure. On success, this is identical to incremental, =
but
          on failure it clears only the bits that were copied successfull=
y.
          This can be used to "resume" incremental backups from later poi=
nts
          in times.

I wrote this series by accident on my way to implement incremental mode
for mirror, but this happened first -- the problem is that Mirror mode
uses its existing modes in a very particular way; and this was the best
way to add bitmap support into the mirror job properly.

Summary:
- 01-03: refactor blockdev-backup and drive-backup to share more interfac=
e code
- 04-05: add the new 'bitmap' sync mode with sync policy 'conditional',
         which is functionally identical to 'incremental' sync mode.
- 06:    add sync policy 'never' ("Differential" backups.)
- 07-11: rework some merging code to facilite patch 12;
- 12:    add sync policy 'always' ("Resumable" backups)
- 13-16: test infrastructure changes to support patch 16:
- 17:    new iotest!
- 18:    minor policy loosening as a QOL improvement

Future work:
 - Update bitmaps.rst to explain these. (WIP, it's hard, sorry!)
 - Add these modes to Mirror. (Done*, but needs tests.)
 - Allow the use of bitmaps and bitmap sync modes with non-BITMAP modes;
   This will allow for resumable/re-tryable full backups.

Changes:
004: Fixed typo
     Change @conditional docstring
005: Moved desugaring code into blockdev.c, facilitated by patches 1-3.
006: Change @never docstring slightly.
007: Merge will clear the target bitmap when both components bitmaps are =
empty,
     and the target bitmap is not an alias of either component bitmap.
008: Check orig_size (logical size) instead of size (actual size) to enab=
le
         cross-granularity merging.
     Fix the sparse merge itself, based on the block/backup code.
     Clear the target bitmap before cross-granularity merge.
     Assert the size is itself equal when logical size and granularities =
are
         equal.
---: Dropped bdrv_dirty_bitmap_claim.
012: Rewrote the cleanup logic to hopefully be clearer.
     use merge intsead of dropped reclaim.
015: Changed docstring
     factored out filename pattern generation.
017: Fix mkpattern indent.
     Use integer division!!!
     Add parenthesis to boolean assignment
     Change test run ordering; update output to reflect this
     Use virtio-scsi-ccw when appropriate
     Update test output to reflect new test running order
018: Fallout from patches 1-3; restrictions only need loosened in one pla=
ce
         instead of two.

Changes not made:
- Allowing 'cancel' to skip synchronization on cancel:
  Decided against it, opting for consistency. The user asked for a sync,
  and it's simpler logistically to execute on that desire.
  Use the new mode carefully, please!
