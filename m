Thanks for doing that. This is typically the kind of effort I never
dared starting on my own.

Sort of but not exactly. The real parallelization, ie. doing parallel
processing with concurrent threads, doesn't take place on a per-request
basis. A typical request is broken down into several calls to the backend
which may block because the backend itself calls a syscall that may block
in the kernel. Each backend call is thus handled by its own thread from the
mainloop thread pool (see hw/9pfs/coth.[ch] for details). The rest of the
9p code, basically everything in 9p.c, is serialized in the mainloop thread.
