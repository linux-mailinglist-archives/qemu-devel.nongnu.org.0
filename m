When the COW areas are included, the size of an allocation can exceed
INT_MAX.  This is kind of limited by handle_alloc() in that it already
caps avail_bytes at INT_MAX, but the number of clusters still reflects
the original length.

This can have all sorts of effects, ranging from the storage layer write
call failing to image corruption.  (If there were no image corruption,
then I suppose there would be data loss because the .cow_end area is
forced to be empty, even though there might be something we need to
COW.)

Fix all of it by limiting nb_clusters so the equivalent number of bytes
will not exceed INT_MAX.
