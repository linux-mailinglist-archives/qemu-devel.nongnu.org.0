Virtio-mmio used to be necessary because "qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt"
lacked a PCI host originally. (The relevant commit is 4ab29b8214cc,
"arm: Add PCIe host bridge in virt machine", 2015-02-13; part of v2.3.0.)

Indeed I don't expect anyone to use virtio-mmio nowadays, and removing
it would simplify both our home-grown VIRTIO_DEVICE_PROTOCOL, and the
virtio drivers.

But it's extra work, not entirely risk-free (regressions), and I can't
tell if someone out there still uses virtio-mmio (despite me thinking
that would be unreasonable). I wouldn't like to see more work sunk into
it either way :)
