Well, adding a command can't hurt anyway, so doing both in parallel
seemed like a good option. :-)

Ah, so basically we don't fully check the correctness of the
introspection output, but just that two different generated files are
consistent with each other. Yes, makes sense.

I just didn't realise that the generated code is actually compiled and
linked to some other test cases. My expectation was the schema testing
was only in tests/qapi-schema/.
