OK, at least the series got some attention, be it on IRC or on the list. I
still find it odd that suddenly, after months and months of this series
practically sitting on the list, any suggestion couldn't first be discussed
here, so that we collectively find the best outcome. But, yes, I probably
produced much ado about nothing. I hope that this would soon result in
helping Michael complete the integration. Micheal, whatever I said
regarding patch 4, is only a suggestion - if others are fine with it, I am
fine too. Best luck to all involved! :)
