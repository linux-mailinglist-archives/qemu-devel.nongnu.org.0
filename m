It's used for the upper boundary in several loops in target/arm/kvm64.c

I don't think we need to implement an A64FX cpu model with this series,
although that's a nice idea for people that focus on TCG to do as a
follow-up series. This series fully enables the guest to use SVE on the
A64FX when KVM is enabled, without the need to special case it in any way.
