Do you guys know perhaps which module is reading the ACPI configuration 
for VMBus? vmbus.sys / vmbkmcl.sys / winhv.sys? is it the kernel or HAL?

I dont have any real HyperV Windows to play with...

Roman, do you remember when is this information being used? Do we need a 
full emulation setup (aka your hv-scsi / hv-net) patches in order to see 
Windows working this ACPI entry?

Thanks,
