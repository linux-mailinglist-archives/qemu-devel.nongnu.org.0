I=E2=80=99m a bit conflicted.  On one hand, I share your concern.  On the o=
ther,
I find it completely reasonable that drivers might want to do I/O when
permissions change.

Usually, this is done as part of reopen, like in qcow2 when a drive
changes from R/W to RO and caches need to be flushed.  But I actually
think it makes more sense as part of the permission system, because of
course a reopen is not the only time when permissions can change.

So that would be another alternative, to implement
.bdrv_reopen_prepare(), and to check reopen_state->perm there.  If
RESIZE is about to go away, then we truncate.  We could keep track of
whether we did any preallocations after the last such truncate, and if
we did, do another truncate on close.

This would cover reopen at least.  Seems better than nothing, but, well...

(One big problem I see with truncating in .bdrv_child_perm() is that
that function is in no way committing.  It=E2=80=99s just a request: =E2=80=
=9CIf your
parents need this of you, what do you need of your children?=E2=80=9D
But I think that could be addressed by doing it in .bdrv_set_perm()
instead.  Of note is that file-posix actually does do I/O in its
raw_set_perm() function, in that it commits to file locks.)

In theory, yes; in practice, exact=3Dfalse just means to ignore failures
due to unsupported sizes.  So in this example, the driver would have
resized to 5M because 2M is an impossible size, and thus the shrink on
close would just fail.

Same as above, in practice the only difference between exact=3Dfalse and
exact=3Dtrue is how failures are reported.

Yes, let=E2=80=99s just leave it as you wrote it.

(It=E2=80=99s a bit silly of me to argue based on how drivers handle exact=
=3Dfalse
