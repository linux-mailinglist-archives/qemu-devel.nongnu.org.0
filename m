Hmm, that didn't help, though it might make sense to keep it there anyway.

What the test case does is:

  1. Enable the timer (with zero expiration time) and reset it at the same =
time.
  2. Disable the timer zero cycles after it was enabled.

It also touches a bunch of other bits (including reserved bits), but
they should be irrelevant.

I think there are two issues here.

When the Reset bit is set, the Enable bit should be forced to zero.
This is easy to fix.

If the timer is enabled with zero expiration time, and immediately
disabled without advancing the virtual time, npcm7xx_timer_pause() is
called while the timer is active, but t->expires_ns =3D=3D
qemu_clock_get_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL). So t->remaining_ns becomes zero
and triggers the assertion.

If I revert a change that Philippe asked me to do earlier:

    timer_del(&t->qtimer);
     now =3D qemu_clock_get_ns(QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL);
     t->remaining_ns =3D t->expires_ns - now;
-    g_assert(t->remaining_ns > 0);
+    if (t->remaining_ns <=3D 0) {
+        npcm7xx_timer_reached_zero(t);
+    }
 }

it doesn't crash:

$ cat << EOF | ./qemu-system-arm -machine npcm750-evb -m 128M -qtest
stdio --trace npcm7xx_timer*
write 0xf0009040 0x4 0xc4c4c4c4

te 0
OK
[S +0.180927] OK
[I +0.181319] CLOSED
[I +4.003267] CLOSED

Note that the npcm7xx_timer_irq trace event is a sign of the first
bug, but fixing that might mask the second bug. If we write the same
pattern, only without the Reset bit, this would be the correct
behavior (and it still causes the v8 code to crash).

I think this device deserves a qtest. I wonder if we'd trigger the
assertion if we set a nonzero expiration time, but happen to clear the
Enable bit on the exact cycle it's supposed to expire. That would be a
more realistic scenario, as it wouldn't require multiple register
writes in the same virtual clock cycle.

I probably won't add the qtest to the same series, as I'd like someone
from Nuvoton to get a chance to review it first.
