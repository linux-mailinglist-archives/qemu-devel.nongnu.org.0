Thanks for your time on the discussion.

Well, I would say we saw two side of a coin. TCP connection isn't bidirecti=
onal
until accept() is called on server side. The connection isn't fully functio=
nal
until two directions are finalized. It would be unplug if the connection is=
 treated
as the cable :)

Yep, the point is to has user's buy-in and it seems an explicit option like
"allow-data-lost" fills the gap, but it seems Peter isn't reaching conclusi=
on
or decision yet. Lets see what's that finally :)

Thanks,
