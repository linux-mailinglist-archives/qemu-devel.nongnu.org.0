There is a long story why two write functions are needed.
i tried to use only one, but at the end I and Daniel both agreed
that its just better to have two functions.

The reason is that during creation, the luks BlockDriverState doesn't exist=
 yet,
and so the creation routine basically just writes to the underlying protoco=
l driver.

Thats is why the block_crypto_create_write_func receives a BlockBackend poi=
nter,
to which the BlockDriverState of the underlying protocol driver is inserted=
.


On the other hand, for amend, the luks block device is open, and it only kn=
ows
about its own BlockDriverState, and thus the io should be done on bs->file

So instead of trying to coerce a single callback to do both of this,
we decided to just have a little code duplication.

You are right! I made this change now and include
it in the next iteration of the patches.
