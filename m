Yeah, that does sound like a candidate for the cause. I wonder if that
was intentional in the GLib design or just an accidental impl they didn't
realize had performance implications. Might be worth filing a bug against
GLib if someone has free time & motivation to figure out a standalone
reproducer to demonstrate the performance difference in the GLib APIs.
