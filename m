Not really, but I have been using the accel class init function on x86 to register the TCG OPS,

and this instead requires a bit more thought for ARM,

because we currently register for the ARM M Profile the TCG Ops at arm_v7m_class_init time,
which is called already at select_machine() time,

so when we select the accelerator, and we call the tcg_cpu_class_init, we run the risk of overriding the existing tcg_ops,
with the current result that we have to do:

static void tcg_cpu_class_init(CPUClass *cc)
{
    /*                                                                                                                                      
     * do not overwrite the TCG ops, if already set by the                                                                                  
     * arm cpu class (this is the case for the M profile CPUs).                                                                             
     *                                                                                                                                      
     * Otherwise, provide the default ARM TCG behavior here.                                                                                
     */
    if (!cc->tcg_ops) {
        cc->tcg_ops = &arm_tcg_ops;
    }
}

It's a fine result for me, but we do have an "if" inside a class_init.

Ideas? Looks horrible?

THanks,

Claudio
