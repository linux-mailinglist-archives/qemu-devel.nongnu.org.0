This hunk seems okay.

if software doesn't know how to interpret the field, it may be safely 
ignored, other than preserving the field unchanged when rewriting the 
image header.

Missing:

If header_length excludes an optional field, the value of 0 should be 
used for that field.

We don't use the @header_length markup anywhere else in this file, 
starting to do so here is odd.

I would suggest a stronger requirement:

header_length must be a multiple of 4, and must not land in the middle 
of any optional 8-byte field.

Or maybe even add our compression type extension with 4 bytes of 
padding, so that we could go even stronger:

header_length must be a multiple of 8.

I don't think this belongs in the spec.  Ideally, we add fields so 
infrequently that backporting doesn't have to worry about backporting 
field 2 while skipping field 1.

Again, I don't think this adds anything.  Since we already documented 
fields are optional, and that if header_length is too short, the missing 
field is treated as 0, software that knows about a longer header_length 
will already handle it correctly.

I'm still not seeing the value in adding any of this paragraph to the 
spec.  Maybe in the commit message that accompanies the spec change, but 
the spec is clear enough if it documents how optional header fields are 
to be managed (treat as 0 if missing, preserve on write if unknown, and 
with a mandated alignment to avoid having to worry about other issues).
