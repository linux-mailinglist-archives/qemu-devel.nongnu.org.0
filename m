You're welcome ;)

Interesting.

Is coroutine-incompatible command handler code necessary or accidental?

By "necessary" I mean there are (and likely always will be) commands
that need to do stuff that cannot or should not be done on coroutine
context.

"Accidental" is the opposite: coroutine-incompatibility can be regarded
as a fixable flaw.

How widespread is coroutine-incompatibility?  Common, or just a few
commands?

If coroutine-incompatibility is accidental, then your code to drop out
of coroutine context can be regarded as a temporary work-around.  Such
work-arounds receive a modest extra ugliness & complexity budget.

If coroutine-incompatibility is rare, we'll eventually want "mark the
known-bad ones with 'coroutine': false" instead of "mark the known-good
ones with 'coroutine': true".  I'm okay with marking the known-good ones
initially, and flipping only later.

Inability to recognize coroutine-incompatibility by inspection worries
me.  Can you think of ways to identify causes other than testing things
to death?
