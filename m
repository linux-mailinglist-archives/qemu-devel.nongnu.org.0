>=20

	The purpose behind separating QEMU into multiple processes is
to provide an additional layer protection for the infrastructure against
a malign guest, not for the guest against itself, so preventing a server
that has been compromised by a guest from accessing all of guest memory
adds no additional benefit.  We don=E2=80=99t even have an IOMMU in our =
current
guest model for this reason.

	The implementation was stolen from vhost-user, with the =
exception
that we push IOTLB translations from client to server like VFIO does, as
opposed to pulling them from server to client like vhost-user does.

	That said, neither the qemu-mp nor MUSER implementation uses an
IOMMU, so if you prefer another IOMMU model, we can consider it.  We
could only send the guest memory file descriptors with IOMMU_MAP_DMA
requests, although that would cost performance since each request would
require the server to execute an mmap() system call.

>=20

	SCM_RIGHTS message controls allow sendmsg() to send an array of
file descriptors over a UNIX domain socket.

	We=E2=80=99re only supporting one device per socket in this =
protocol
version, so the device ID will always be 0.  This may change in a future
revision, so we included the field in the header to avoid a major =
version
change if device multiplexing is added later.

>=20

	Yes.  We will attempt to make the language clearer.

>=20

	The base offset refers to the sparse areas, where the sparse =
area
offset is added to the base region offset.  We will try to make the text
clearer here as well.

	MMIO was added to distinguish these operations from DMA =
operations.
I can see how this can cause confusion when the region refers to a port =
range,
so we can change the name to REGION_READ/WRITE.=20

>=20

	This is a bug in the doc.  As you said, the read field should
be the amount of data to be read.

>=20

	It is a GPA.  The device emulation code would only handle the =
DMA
addresses the guest programmed it with; the server infrastructure knows
whether an IOMMU exists, and whether the DMA address needs translation =
to
GPA or not.

>=20

	The client and server are equally trusted; the guest is the =
untrusted
entity.

	ok

	Groups and containers are host IOMMU concepts, and we don=E2=80=99=
t
interact with the host here.  The kernel VFIO driver doesn=E2=80=99t =
even need
to exist for VFIO over socket.  I think it=E2=80=99s fine to assume a =
1-1
correspondence between containers, groups, and a VFIO over socket =
device.

	Thanks for looking this over.
