My plan is to remove Python 2 support in QEMU 4.2 (making the
fallback to Python 2 a non-issue), and require Python >= 3.5.

Now, even if my plan is rejected and we keep supporting Python 2
when building QEMU 4.2, my suggestion for the iotest maintainers
is to make it require Python 3.5+ immediately, just like we do
for tests/acceptance.  I don't see why we should keep wasting our
energy supporting ancient Python versions in a test suite that is
not a requirement for building QEMU.
