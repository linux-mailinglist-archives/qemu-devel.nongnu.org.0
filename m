- Since [vmx|invtsc]_mig_blocker are both global in scope, isn't it possi=
ble you end up deleting one or both valid blockers that were created by a=
 previous invocation of kvm_arch_init_vcpu() ?  Seems to me that you woul=
d need something like an additional pair of local boolean variables named=
 created_[vmx|invtsc]_mig_blocker and condition the calls to migrate_del_=
blocker() accordingly. On the positive side, that would simplify some of =
the logic around when and if it's ok to jump to "fail" (and you wouldn't =
need the "fail2").

The example I was thinking about is a VM that is created with a bunch of=20
vCPUs -- all of which require installation of the blocker(s). Then at=20
some point in the future, a failed CPU hotplug attempt wipes out all the=20
pre-existing blockers and leaves the VM exposed.

But I agree that the problem wasn't introduced by this patch series and=20
so it is reasonable to argue that you shouldn't have to fix it here. As=20
