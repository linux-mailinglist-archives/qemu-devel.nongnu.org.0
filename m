!?

- you sent to me info on slack that I did not see until now, next time 
be sure I have acknowledged if it is important.

- You told me to dive into this patch quite abruptly, and it invested 
time to understand how the I/O works with PV, so sorry for the wrong time

- I see no problem with the questions from Thomas, may be you can 
explain this to me

- I have a lot of other things to do so I just close this thread after 
having answered to Thomas.
