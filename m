Pre-existing grammar nits, that you may want to touch up while reformatting:

Is th is 'as wide as a pointer' or 'no wider than a pointer'? In other 
words, can 'val' be a narrower type?

Is that all operations in this same section, or only the last set of two 
operations (atomic_mb_read/set)?  What is the appropriate code to use if 
a pointer is wider than int?

Missing semicolon after smp_mb()

'shall' is awkward (if this is not a formal RFC-style requirement), 
better for colloquial English is 'must' or 'should' (twice)

Reads better as:

QEMU's atomic_read/set implement C11 atomic relaxed semantics if the 
compiler supports it, and volatile semantics otherwise.
