Yeh it was getting hairy enough at the time, so I kept that restriction.

Right.

Yeh I think that's about right; you might have to watch out for cases
where the RAMBlock sizes are different because they've got rounded.

Precopy doesn't have to worry about it because it doesn't have to clear
out previously partially sent pages.

You'd have a situation where the source things page p+8k is dirty so
sends a discard for that; the destination can't do that - so what does
it do?  You need to get the source to discard on the largest granularity
of source and destination.

The other problem you have here is making sure that the source really
does send all the pages continuously starting from the right point so
that they all end up in one chunk on the destination and it can perform
a place;  for example imagine the source is doing a background
page transfer and is currently at x+1MB,  now it gets a request
from the destination for page y, so it switches to transmitting 'y'
which given the destinations request it will probably transfer
the whole of y - but x was partially transmitted which means
x won't have got placed on the destination.  I'd also worry about
whether the code on the source is OK if it gets a request for 'z'
while it's sending y, but it's probably ok because it has the
counter.

(I'm not sure if there are any changes needed in postcopy recovery -
that was more recent).

Note it's not just hugepages either; you get aarch and power systems
that can have configurable base page sizes, but it's rare to mix
them.
