So as I understand the proposal, the 16 bit limit comes about because
we want a round 4 byte reply, 16 bits are used by NBD_INFO_INIT_STATE
and that leaves 16 bits feature bits.  Therefore the only way to go
from there is to have 32 feature bits but an awkward unaligned 6 byte
structure, or 48 feature bits (8 byte structure).

I guess given those constraints we can stick with 16 feature bits, and
if we ever needed more then we'd have to introduce NBD_INFO_INIT_STATE2.

The only thing I can think of which might be useful is a "fully
preallocated" bit which might be used as an indication that writes are
fast and are unlikely to fail with ENOSPC.

Seems reasonable to me.
