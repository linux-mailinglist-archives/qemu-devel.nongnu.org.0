Same to you (my sorry excuse is KVM Forum).  Now we need to hurry to get
this fix into 4.2.  Let's try.

Let's rename to _cleanup_queue_and resume().  The plural is a remnant
from when we also had a response queue.  Gone since commit 27656018d86.

Comment lines should be wrapped around colum 70.

Now let me digest the comment.  Here's condition in
monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher():

    need_resume =3D !qmp_oob_enabled(mon) ||
        mon->qmp_requests->length =3D=3D QMP_REQ_QUEUE_LEN_MAX - 1;

"Same but before removing" is

       bool need_resume =3D !qmp_oob_enabled(mon)
           || mon->qmp_requests->length =3D=3D QMP_REQ_QUEUE_LEN_MAX;

That leaves the "also" part.  It's been too long since v1, I don't
remember a thing, and I'm too dense today to understand without more
help.  Can you help me some more?

CHR_EVENT_CLOSED

Suggest:

           /*
            * handle_qmp_command() suspened the monitor because the
            * request queue filled up, to be resumed when the queue has
            * space again.  We just emptied it; resume the monitor.
            */

If we want to record the issue that made us fix the missing resume, we
can add:

            * Without this, the monitor would remain suspended forever
            * when we get here while the monitor is suspended.  An
            * unfortunately times CHR_EVENT_CLOSED can do the trick.

Also update handle_qmp_command()'s comment:

    /*
     * Suspend the monitor when we can't queue more requests after
     * this one.  Dequeuing in monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher() or
     * monitor_qmp_cleanup_queue_and_resume() will resume it.
     * Note that when OOB is disabled, we queue at most one command,
     * for backward compatibility.
