Mmm. I wasn't sure to what extent glib expects the
GMainContext and GMainLoop to match up, so I was mostly
just copying from iothread.c.

So we're OK to not do this because tests/iothread.c's
main loop doesn't call g_main_loop_run(), and it doesn't
provide an iothread_get_g_main_context() ?

I'm kind of inclined towards being lazy and sticking with
what this patch has, because:
 * it matches the real iothread.c, which reduces the possiblity
   of future surprise bugs due to things not matching up
 * it's already been reviewed
 * it saves me having to do a respin and retest

But if people would prefer these bits deleted I'll stop
being lazy :-)

thanks
