Hi, Pankaj

I tried this series with v14 kernel driver, while getting some error on using
this. Not sure this is my error configuration.

The qemu command line is:

    -object memory-backend-file,id=mem1,share=on,mem-path=/dev/dax0.0,size=1G,align=2M 
    -device virtio-pmem-pci,memdev=mem1,id=nv1

The guest boots up and I can see /dev/pmem0 device. But when I want to
partition this device, I got the error:

    # parted /dev/pmem0 mklabel gpt
    Warning: Error fsyncing/closing /dev/pmem0: Input/output error

Also I see an error when running "ndctl list":

    libndctl: __sysfs_device_parse: ndctl0: add_dev() failed

Would you mind letting me know which part I am wrong?
