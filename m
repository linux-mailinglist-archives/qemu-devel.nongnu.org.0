Hm, yes, that's true. But I wonder if this is really something that the
permission system must catch. Like other graph manipulations, it's
essentially the user saying "trust me, I know what I'm doing, this node
makes sense in this place".

Because if you assume that the user could add a node with unsuitable
content and you want to prevent this, where do we stop?
blockdev-snapshot can insert a non-empty overlay, which would result in
visible data change. Should we therefore only allow snapshots when
shared writes are allowed? This doesn't work obviously.

So I'm inclined to say that this is the user's responsibility and we
don't have to jump through hoops to prevent every possible way that the
user could mess up. (Which often also result in preventing legitimate
cases like here a quorum of read-only nodes.)
