The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  qemu-img convert malfunction on macOS

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  On macOS 10.13.6, `qemu-img convert` failed to convert a qcow2 into a
  new qcow2 (for the purpose of shrinking the image).

  A 50GB (3.7GB allocated) qcow2 image was used as source. The qemu-img
  convert output was a 3.4MB file.

  qemu-img from HomeBrew were tested. Both 2.11.1 and 3.1.0_1 failed to
  convert a qcow2 image.
