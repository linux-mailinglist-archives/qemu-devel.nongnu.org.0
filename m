I haven't looked at the code yet, but as the last one was fine it's probably
OK.  My only issue here is the timing: it's after the soft freeze so if I
understand correctly we're not supposed to take any new features into 4.1.
That's kind of unfortunate because it's somewhat unobtrusive and super useful.

Peter: would you be OK taking this some time later this week?  I'd want to dig
through it and then bang on it a bit first.  If not then I'll queue it up for
4.2.
