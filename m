I'm attaching a patch (based on 0e3246263068). I'm not convinced that I
should take responsibility for this, given the lack of testability on my
end. So I'm not posting it stand-alone even as an RFC. I've built it and
have booted one of my existent domains with it, but that's all.

Thanks
Laszlo

Subject: [PATCH] coroutine-sigaltstack: overhaul SIGUSR2 treatment
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

(1) Disposition (action) for any given signal is global for the process.
    When two threads run coroutine-sigaltstack's qemu_coroutine_new()
    concurrently, they may interfere with each other: one of them may
    revert the SIGUSR2 handler to SIG_DFL, between the other thread (a)
    setting up coroutine_trampoline() as the handler and (b) raising
    SIGUSR2. That SIGUSR2 will then terminate the QEMU process abnormally.

    Outside of coroutine-sigaltstack, qemu does not use SIGUSR2 [*]. So
    move the pthread_sigmask() and sigaction() calls from
    qemu_coroutine_new() to coroutine_init(). This will keep the handler
    installed all the time, while also ensuring that all threads block
    SIGUSR2 all the time.

    [*] In user-mode emulation, the guest can register signal handlers for
        any signal but SIGSEGV and SIGBUS, so if it registers a SIGUSR2
        handler, that will interfere with coroutine-sigaltstack. However,
        we do not use coroutines for user-mode emulation, so that is fine.

(2) The temporary unblocking of SIGUSR2 in qemu_coroutine_new() with
    sigsuspend(), which implements the synchronous delivery of SIGUSR2 to
    the thread, is needlessly complicated. Remove the "tr_called"-based
    loop around sigsuspend(), as by the time we reach sigsuspend(),
    SIGUSR2 is certainly pending.

(3) Relatedly, the top of the signal handler can only be entered via the
    sigsuspend() in qemu_coroutine_new(). Express this fact in the signal
    handler by abort()ing on (tr_handler==NULL).

    First, even if another process sends a SIGUSR2 to the QEMU process
    asynchronously, SIGUSR2 will only be unblocked by sigsuspend() in the
    next qemu_coroutine_new() execution, and by that time, the thread in
    question will have raised SIGUSR2 anyway.

    Second, there is no reason for sigsuspend() *not* to be both a
    compiler barrier and a memory barrier.

(4) Finally, the "tr_handler" field should be more strongly typed; it only
    ever points to a CoroutineSigAltStack object.

Based on Max's original patch.
