Title:
  Failed to create HAX VM

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I'm running the latest (master) of QEMU, though the version doesn't
  seem to matter - I also checked back to v4.2.0, exactly the same
  issue. And this isn't about the VM (guest), if I even just try to run,

  > "c:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" -accel hax

  Basically, just get a window to open, with acceleration enabled ... I get,
  Open the vm device error:/dev/hax_vm/vm00, ec:3
  Failed to open vm 0
  Failed to create HAX VM
  No accelerator found.

  But I checked - I have installed Intel HAXM, and verified it's running,
  > sc query intelhaxm
  SERVICE_NAME: intelhaxm
          TYPE               : 1  KERNEL_DRIVER
          STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                                  (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOW=
N)
          WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
          SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
          CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
          WAIT_HINT          : 0x0

  Just remove the accelerator (-accel hax), and I get a window - so this
  is related to QEMU being able to contact / use the accelerator.

  Help!?!?

  Thanks!
