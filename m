Welcome to the club O:-)

And I thought that with the reviewed-by I had finished here O:-)

it is an error.  All should be padded.

Ok.
Taking a look at this.

Grrr.  It should be used, but it is not :-(

What we have here:
- A static buffer

    uint8_t runstate[100];

That is partially filled.
size: is the size of that buffer that is filled.

But, as we are using

        VMSTATE_BUFFER(runstate, GlobalState),

We are always sending/receiving the whole buffer.  THat is why we have
trouble with padding.  What should we being doing?

Sending just the size, the filled bytes, and making sure that there is
enough space on destination.

But we aren't donig that.  And at this point, I think that I am only
going to fix the 1st part (always zero pad everything sent).

For fixing the other bit, I need to do an incompatible change.

> Juan: Please clarify the above.  Thanks!

Thanks a lot.

Later, Juan.

PD: Why is it done this way?
    Because at the moment, the problem was that qcow2 (as a system, not
    as a device) didn't have a place where to plug pending requests.  So
    I created this section that always exist, and anything that has not
    a device associated can hang a subsection here.  Once that I created
    it, nobody used it.
    And now, just seing what you are telling, I didn't even used the
    right approach.
