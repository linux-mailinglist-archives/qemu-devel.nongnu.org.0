I found one case where the performance is significantly improved by
c8bb23cbdbe: In the cases so far I had XFS in the guest, now I used
ext4, and with aio=3Dnative (on the ext4 host with 2 MB clusters), the
performance goes from 63.9 - 65.0 MB/s to 75.7 - 76.4 MB/s (so +18%).

The difference is smaller for 64 kB clusters, but still there at +13%.
That=E2=80=99s probably the more important fact, because these are the defa=
ult
settings, and this is probably about what would happen with 2 MB
clusters + subclusters.

(Patch 4 in this series doesn=E2=80=99t decrease the performance.)

This is a tough decision for me because from some people tell me =E2=80=9CL=
et=E2=80=99s
just revert it, there are problems with it and we don=E2=80=99t quite know =
what
good it does in practice=E2=80=9D, and others say =E2=80=9CWe have (not rea=
lly
practical) benchmarks that show it does something good for our specific
case=E2=80=9D.  And all that while those two groups never seem to talk to e=
ach
other directly.

So I suppose I=E2=80=99m going to have to make a decision.  I now know a ca=
se
where c8bb23cbdbe is actually beneficial.  I myself have never seen
c8bb23cbdbe decrease performance, but I know Laurent has seen a drastic
performance degradation, and he=E2=80=99s used it to bisect the XFS problem=
 to
that commit, so it=E2=80=99s really real.  But I haven=E2=80=99t seen it, a=
nd as far as
I know it really only happens on ppc64.


In light of this, I would prefer to revert c8bb23cbdbe for 4.1.1, and
keep it for 4.2.0.  But I don=E2=80=99t know whether we can do that, all I =
know
is that I=E2=80=99m not going to find out in time for 4.1.1.

If we keep c8bb23cbdbe in any way, we need patches 2 through 4, that
much is clear.

I believe we can think about the performance problem after 4.2.0.  I
would love to benchmark c8bb23cbdbe on a fixed kernel, but there just
isn=E2=80=99t time for that anymore.


I=E2=80=99m not a fan of keeping c8bb23cbdbe behind a configure switch.  If=
 it=E2=80=99s
beneficial, it should be there for everyone.


OK.  Some may see this as a wrong decision, but someone needs to make
one now, so here goes: ext4 is the default Linux FS for most
distributions.  As far as I can tell from my own benchmarks, c8bb23cbdbe
brings a significant performance improvement for qcow2 images with the
default configuration on this default filesystem with aio=3Dnative and
doesn=E2=80=99t change much in any other case.

What happens on ppc64 is a problem, but that=E2=80=99s a RHEL problem becau=
se
it=E2=80=99s specific to XFS (and also ppc64).  It also won=E2=80=99t be a =
regression on
4.2 compared to 4.1.

Dave=E2=80=99s argument was good that fallocate() and AIO cannot mix (at le=
ast
on XFS), but I couldn=E2=80=99t see any impact of that in my benchmarks (ma=
ybe
my benchmarks were just wrong).


So I think for upstream it=E2=80=99ll be best if I send a v2 which doesn=E2=
=80=99t touch
handle_alloc_space(), and instead just consists of patches 2 through 4.
 (And CC it all to stable.)

I think we still need to keep track of the XFS/ppc64 issue and do more
benchmarks especially with the fixed XFS driver.


tl;dr:
The main arguments for reverting c8bb23cbdbe were (AFAIU):
- a general uneasy feeling about it
- theoretical arguments that it must be bad on XFS
- actual problems on ppc64/XFS
- =E2=80=9Cwhat good does it do in practice?=E2=80=9D
- that subclusters would make it obsolete anyway

What I could see is:
- no impact on XFS in practice
- significant practical benefit on ext4
- subclusters probably wouldn=E2=80=99t make it obsolete, because I can sti=
ll
see a +13% improvement for 64 kB clusters (2 MB clusters + subclusters
gives you 64 kB subclusters)

In addition, it needs to be considered that ext4 is the default FS for
most Linux distributions.

As such, I personally am not convinced of reverting this patch.  Let=E2=80=
=99s
keep it, have patches 2 through 4 for 4.1.1 and 4.2.0, and think about
what to do for ppc64/XFS later.

Max
