Well, my opinion is that this is a bit of weird thing to do and that it
basically does ask for a loop.

I=92m OK with excluding the sync=3Dnone case, because (1) that=92s so
obviously a loop that it can=92t be what the user honestly wants; (2) how
it=92s resolved is rather obvious, too: There is exactly one edge that
causes the loop, so you simply don=92t change that one; (3) drive-mirror
sync=3Dnone does this case automatically, so we should probably allow
users to do it manually with blockdev-mirror, too.

Well, there are multiple cases, as shown in the commit message.  I think
that for drive-mirror sync=3Dnone, nobody uses @replaces, because it just
doesn=92t work.

But, well, that=92s just because drive-mirror does graph manipulation that
blockdev-mirror doesn=92t (i.e., changing the target=92s backing file on
completion).  So maybe we should just prevent loops for drive-mirror,
but let the user do what they want when they use blockdev-mirror?
