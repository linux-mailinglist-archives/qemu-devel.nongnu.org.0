This requires major changes to existing QMP command handlers. Did you
consider at least optionally providing a way where instead of using the
new async_fn, QMP already creates a coroutine in which the handler is
executed?

At least for some of the block layer commands, we could simply enable
this without changing any of the code and would automatically get rid of
blocking the guest while the command is doing I/O. If we need to
implement .async_fn, in contrast, it would be quite a bit of boiler
plate code for each single handler to create a coroutine for the real
handler and to wrap all parameters in a struct.

I started playing a bit with this and it didn't look too bad, but we
can't move every command handler to a coroutine without auditing it, so
I would have had to add a new option to the QAPI schema - and at that
point I thought that I might end up duplicating a lot of your code if I
continued. So I'm now trying to get your opinion or advice before I
continue with anything in that direction.

This part would certainly become simpler with coroutines (the marshaller
could stay unchanged).

After converting it to QIOChannel like you already do, I/O would
automatically become asynchronous when run in a coroutine.

If you don't want this yet, but only fix the BZ, I guess you could delay
that patch until later and just have a single yield and reenter of the
command handler coroutine like this:

    co =3D qemu_coroutine_self();
    aio_co_schedule(qemu_coroutine_get_aio_context(co), co);
    qemu_coroutine_yield();
