This series provides an asynchronous means of reporting free guest pages
to QEMU through virtio-balloon so that the memory associated with those
pages can be dropped and reused by other processes and/or guests on the
host. Using this it is possible to avoid unnecessary I/O to disk and
greatly improve performance in the case of memory overcommit on the host.

I originally submitted this patch series back on February 11th 2020[1],
but at that time I was focused primarily on the kernel portion of this
patch set. However as of April 7th those patches are now included in
Linus's kernel tree[2] and so I am submitting the QEMU pieces for
inclusion.

Changes from v17:
Fixed typo in patch 1 title
Addressed white-space issues reported via checkpatch
Added braces {} for two if statements to match expected coding style

Changes from v18:
Updated patches 2 and 3 based on input from dhildenb
Added comment to patch 2 describing what keeps us from reporting a bad page
Added patch to address issue with ROM devices being directly writable

Changes from v19:
Added std-headers change to match changes pushed for linux kernel headers
Added patch to remove "report" from page hinting code paths
Updated comment to better explain why we disable hints w/ page poisoning
Removed code that was modifying config size for poison vs hinting
Dropped x-page-poison property
Added code to bounds check the reported region vs the RAM block
Dropped patch for ROM devices as that was already pulled in by Paolo

Changes from v20:
Rearranged patches to push Linux header sync patches to front
Removed association between free page hinting and VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON
Added code to enable VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON if page reporting is enabled
Fixed possible resource leak if poison or qemu_balloon_is_inhibited return true

Changes from v21:
Added ack for patch 3
Rewrote patch description for page poison reporting feature
Made page-poison independent property and set to enabled by default
Added logic to migrate poison_val
Added several comments in code to better explain features
Switched free-page-reporting property to disabled by default

Changes from v22:
Added ack for patches 4 & 5
Added additional comment fixes in patch 3 to remove "reporting" reference
Renamed rvq in patch 5 to reporting_vq to improve readability
Moved call adding reporting_vq to after free_page_vq to fix VQ ordering
