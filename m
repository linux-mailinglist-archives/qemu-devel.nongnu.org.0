The "additional privileges" are only host userspace code execution (i.e.
syscalls) within an unprivileged process that is sandboxed using seccomp
and SELinux on a properly configured system.  If QEMU has access to
resources that do not belong to the guest then you have not configured
QEMU correctly (libvirt handles a lot of this setup for you).

I think it's more accurate to describe the motivation for multi-process
QEMU in terms of the principle of least privilege: each component in the
system should only have access to the resources that it needs to perform
its job.  That way people don't get the impression that QEMU is a
trusted component with access to resources that must be kept from the
guest.

"it would be a control point that executes the processes needed to
support the VM being created"

libvirt does the sandboxing setup.  I think the responsibility of
executing and sandboxing device processes would also be left to libvirt,
not to QEMU.

Perhaps it's best to leave this sentence out and enable both approaches
(1. QEMU executes device processes, 2. management tool executes device
processes).

The next patch documents rid=.  This seems to be the same as remote=?

It might be possible to avoid introducing special-purpose *-remote=
parameters using the -set command-line option.  If you know the id of
the on-board device then you can set the remote= property on it:

  -set piix4-ide.ide0.remote=disk-proc

I haven't tried this but if it works then no code changes are required.

The QMP command name "remote-add" would be consistent with object-add.
(There is also netdev_add and device_add but their names use underscores
for legacy reasons.)

Did you consider defining just -device pci-device-proxy,remote=ID and
then transferring the device-specific details (e.g. PCI Configuration
Space, BARs, and interrupt configuration) over the socket during
initialization?

That way it's not necessary to write proxy devices.  There is just one
PCI proxy device that automatically reflects the information from the
device emulation process.
