Because some properties would not be field properties, for example.  For 
example, any non-scalar property would need to invoke 
visit_SomeQapiStruct manually and would not be a field property.

Eduardo's series is adding allow-set functions to field properties as 
well.  If it's be specified in the function call to 
object_class_add_field_properties, you'd have part of the property 
described in the array and part in the object_class_add_field_properties.

No, I mean that device properties would be handled as

    dc->props = foo;

while object properties would be handled as

    object_class_add_field_properties(oc, foo, prop_allow_set_always);

There would be two different preferred ways to do field properties in 
qdev vs. non-qdev.

Right, but qdev's DEFINE_PROP_STRING would be easy to change to 
something like

- DEFINE_PROP_STRING("name", ...),
+ device_class_add_field_property(dc, "name", PROP_STRING(...));

That'd be a good plan, and I'd add generating the property description 
from the doc comment.  (Though there's still the issue of how to add 
non-field properties to the introspection.  Those would be harder to 
move to the QAPI generator).

But at that point the array vs. function call would not change anything 
(if anything the function call would be a tiny bit better), so that's 
another reason to stay with the API that Eduardo has in v2.
