Oh, yes, I forgot about seccomp - that is almost certainly the problem,
given that this is a public CI system with locked down container config.

Telling users to reconfigure the container to allow mbind() is not a viable
approach. In a public cloud scenario the users will not have any direct
control over the container, and it is entirely unsurprising for mbind to
be blocked.

Ok, so QEMU shouldn't be calling mbind() at all unless there's some config
on the CLI that requests us to change the default binding, which there
is not in this case.
