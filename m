It is caching it but it isn't obvious what to look for.

The "docker build" command is always still run, but you'll
notice each of the actual commands in the dockerfile are
followed by a message "  ---> Using cache", instead of the
normal command output.

Compare the "amd64-debian9-container" job as an example.

Here is the output seen in the original job which actually did a real
build:

   https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/605783351

And here is the output from the pipeline you point to above:

   https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/606175855

The cached case is still taking 2 mins 30 seconds, but the original
full build took 4 mins 50 seconds.

The difference will be more noticable if we expand the list of packages
install in the images to cover more of QEMU's possible dependancies.

Regards,
Daniel
