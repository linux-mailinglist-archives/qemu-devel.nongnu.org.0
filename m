Hi Aleksandar,

The short answer is that Avocado provides no way to report "subtest"
statuses (as a formal concept), neither does the current
"avocado_qemu" infrastructure allow for management of VMs across
tests.  The later is an Avocado-VT feature, and it to be honest it
brings a good deal of problems in itself, which we decided to avoid
here.

About the lack of subtests, we (the autotest project, then the Avocado
project) found that this concept, to be well applied, need more than
we could deal with initially.  For instance, Avocado has the concept
of "pre_test" and "post_test" hooks, with that, should those be
applied to subtests as well?  Also, there's support for capturing
system information (a feature called sysinfo) before and after the
tests... again, should it be applied to subtests?  Avocado also stores
a well defined results directory, and we'd have to deal with something
like that for subtests.  With regards to the variants feature, should
they also be applied to subtests?  The list of questions goes on and
on.

The fact that one test should not be able (as much as possible) to
influence another test also comes into play in our initial decision
to avoid subtests.

IMO, the best way to handle this is to either keep a separate logger
with the test progress:

  https://avocado-framework.readthedocs.io/en/71.0/WritingTests.html#adva=
nced-logging-capabilities

With a change similar to:

---

linux_ssh_mips_malta.py

You could run tests with:

  $ ./tests/venv/bin/avocado --show=3Dconsole,progress run --store-loggin=
g-stream progress -- tests/acceptance/linux_ssh_mips_malta.py

And at the same time:

  $ tail -f ~/avocado/job-results/latest/progress.INFO=20
  17:20:44 INFO | Check successful for "uname -a"
  17:20:44 INFO | Check successful for "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
  ...

I hope this helps somehow.

Best regards,
- Cleber.
