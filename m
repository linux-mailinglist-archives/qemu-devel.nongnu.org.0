That's probably becuase there are no clear rules (such as always prefix=20
files in source dir with $(SRC_PATH), generated files with some BUILDDIR,=
=20
etc.) and these are not documented so every time someone touches it has t=
o=20
explore and debug it again. This could be avoided if these were written=20
down once but instead of trying to document and clean up the build system=
=20
the chosen direction is to just throw it out and replace it with somethin=
g=20
more complex and with more dependencies (Meson) and then to save=20
"additional complexity" it also breaks people's workflow and demand them=20
to adapt themselves. I'm not saying there should be no changes but if=20
there's a way to make them less painful it could be considered if it's no=
t=20
much extra work and in this case it does not seem to be.

OK, so then only supporting out-of-tree builds but adding convenience=20
function and Makefile to still allow people to run configure; make from=20
source dir would solve this without also needing people to change what=20
they always did so why is that solution not acceptable?
