"without a stack" looks very risky to me. Even if we manage to implement
the guest code initially, we'll be trapped without a stack, should we
ever need to add more complex stuff there.

I expressed a preference for that too: "I wish we could simply wake the
new CPU [...] with an SMI".

See again my message linked above -- just after the quoted sentence, I
wrote, "IOW, if we could excise steps 07b, 08a, 08b".

But, I obviously defer to Paolo and Igor on that.

(I do believe we have a dilemma here. In QEMU, we probably prefer to
emulate physical hardware as faithfully as possible. However, we do not
have Cache-As-RAM (nor do we intend to, IIUC). Does that justify other
divergences from physical hardware too, such as waking just by virtue of
an SMI?)

I agree this would be a huge help.

I don't know if the QEMU monitor command in question can guarantee this
serialization. I think such a request/response pattern is generally
implementable between QEMU and guest code.

But, AIUI, the "device-add" monitor command is quite generic, and used
for hot-plugging a number of other (non-CPU) device models. I'm unsure
if the pattern in question can be squeezed into "device-add". (It's not
a dedicated command for CPU hotplug.)

... Apologies that I didn't add much information to the thread, just
now. I'd like to keep the discussion going.

Thanks
Laszlo
