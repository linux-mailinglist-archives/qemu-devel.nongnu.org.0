Correct.

My main objection to your current patch is that you perform the access checks
within MVC, and then do some more tlb lookups in fast_memmove.

I think that fast_memmove is where the access checks should live.  That allows
incremental improvement to combine access checks + host address lookup, which
cannot currently be done in one step with existing interfaces.

I guess you would still want access checks within MVC for the case in which you
must fall back to byte-by-byte because of destructive overlap.

LAP protected pages is exactly why probe_write should return the host address,
so that we can do the access check + host address lookup in one step.

But in the meantime...

You're concerned with a bare write to the page table by cpu B, while cpu A is
executing, and before cpu B issues the cross-cpu tlb flush?

The tlb victim cache should prevent having to re-read a tlb entry from memory,
at least for MVC.  The unlimited size we currently support for MVCL and MVCLE
could act weird, but would be fixed by limiting the execution as discussed.

Honestly, the os has to make sure that the page remains valid until after the
flush completes, otherwise it's an os bug.  The cross-cpu tlb flush happens via
async_run_on_cpu, and of course never occurs while we are executing a TB.  Yet
another reason to limit the amount of work any one instruction does.  ;-)

Heh.

!BP_STOP_BEFORE_ACCESS watchpoints exit to the main loop as well, so that it
can restart and then single-step the current instruction.

We need it the check in probe_write for all cases.

That language is indeed odd.

The only reading of that paragraph that makes sense to me is that the hardware
*must* interrupt MVCL after every 2k bytes processed.  The idea that the user
can magically write to a read-only page simply by providing length = 2MB and
page that is initially writable is dumb.  I cannot imagine that is a correct
reading.

Getting clarification from an IBM engineer on that would be good; otherwise I
would just ignore that and proceed as if all access checks are performed.

Correct.
