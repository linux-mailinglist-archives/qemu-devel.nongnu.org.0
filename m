This looks very similar to what other devices do (one bus controller
that has multiple devices on its but), so I like it.

The thing that is special here is that -device nvme is already a block
device by itself that can take a drive property. So how does this play
together? Can I choose to either specify a drive directly for the nvme
device or nvme-ns devices, but when I do both, I will get an error? What
happens if I don't specify a drive for nvme, but also don't add nvme-ns
devices?
