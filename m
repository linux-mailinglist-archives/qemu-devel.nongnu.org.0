That wouldn't make any sense.  Say you have this configuration:

throttle -> top -> base

Now you stream from base to throttle.  The data goes from base through
throttle to top.  You propose to then make throttle point to base:

throttle -> base

This will discard all the data in top.

Filters don=E2=80=99t store any data.  You need to keep the top data stor=
ing
image, i.e. the first non-filter overlay.

 Hmm, could filter have

No.  A filter passes through data from its children, so it can only have
a single child, or it is quorum.

The file/backing combination is reserved for COW overlays.  file is
where the current layer=E2=80=99s data is, backing is the filtered child.=

I don=E2=80=99t quite understand.  It sounds to me like you=E2=80=99re sa=

This is a check whether it is mandatory for the user to specify the
'backing' key when reopening @bs.  It is mandatory if it currently has a
backing node, or if it should get a backing file by default because the
image header says so.

We don=E2=80=99t care about any node in particular.  The question is just=
 =E2=80=9CIs
there a backing node?=E2=80=9D.  So I don=E2=80=99t see how skipping filt=

Sounds correct, yes.

I suppose we then need a fix for compression, too, though.  Currently,
the code checks whether the target driver offers
=2Ebdrv_co_pwritev_compressed().  First, we should do the same there and
skip filters.  But second, in block/io.c, we then need to also skip
filters for compressed writes (by issuing normal writes to them with the
BDRV_REQ_WRITE_COMPRESSED flag set).

Hm.  If @p is a filter, we could skip straight to *file.  Would that work=
?

Hm, yes, I think that is a mistake.  I=E2=80=99ll try to fix it.

Thanks so far! :-)
