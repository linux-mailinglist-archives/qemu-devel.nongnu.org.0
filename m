HAXM will not only be no longer maintained in QEMU, but also the 
necessary framework for macOS and Windows will be retired. See 
https://github.com/intel/haxm#status on their GitHub page. As stated 
there, macOS provides HVF which can be used instead of HAXM, and Windows 
users can use WHPX. Both HVF and WHPX are supported by QEMU. As far as I 
know HAXM could only provide a limited RAM size (2 GiB?). Maybe it still 
has more deficits. And unmaintained HAXM drivers for macOS and Windows 
might be a security risk, too. It is also not clear whether the last 
downloads of those drivers will be available in the future.

Therefore I'd prefer to remove the whole HAXM code in QEMU soon, even in 
a minor update for this special case.
