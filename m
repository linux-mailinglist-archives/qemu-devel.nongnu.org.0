The interface in vhost-user to pass these memory fd's is a bit hairy;
so it would be great if there was something better for multi-process.

Some things to think about:
  a) vhost-user filters it so that areas of memory not backed by an fd
aren't passed to the client; this filters out some of the device
specific RAM blocks that aren't really normal RAM.

  b) Hugepages are tricky; especially on a PC where the 0-1MB area is
broken up into chunks and you're trying to mmap 2MB chunks into the
client.

  c) Postcopy with vhost-user was pretty tricky as well; there needs
to be some coordination with the qemu to handle pages that are missing.

  d) Some RAM mappings can change; mostly not the ones sent to the
client; but just watch out that these can happen at unexpected times.
