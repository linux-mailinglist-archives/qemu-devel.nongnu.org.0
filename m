Thanks for this patch. It is definitely a missing
bit of functionality that we intend to allow virt to run
EL3 guest code but don't provide a trigger-shutdown/reboot
device that works in that setup.

I think the key question here is whether we want to implement
this by:
(1) providing the sbsa-ec device in the virt board
(2) some other mechanism, eg a secure-only pl061 GPIO
some of whose output pins can trigger shutdown or reboot

The sbsa-ec device has the advantage of doing the
shutdown/reboot functionality at the moment. The question
I have for the sbsa-ref board folks is: what are your future
plans for that device? If the idea is that it's going to end
up stuffed full of sbsa-ref specific functionality that we
wouldn't want to try to expose in the virt board, then we
should probably go with the pl061 approach instead. But if
it's not likely to grow new functionality then it might be
simpler...

A couple of notes on this patch if we do go down that route:
 * we would need to arrange to only add the new device for
   new versions of the virt board (that is, the "virt-5.0"
   machine must not have this device because it must look
   like the version of "virt" that shipped with QEMU 5.0)
 * the device needs to be mapped into the Secure address
   space only, because Secure firmware wants control over
   it and doesn't want to allow NS code to reboot the system
   without asking the firmware
 * it would need to be described in the DTB (and maybe also
   ACPI tables? I forget whether we need to describe Secure-only
  devices there)

But let's find out if that's the route we want to take first.

thanks
