Yep, this is a limitation of the patchew model where we have a central
service testing each contributors patches, instead of having the CI jobs
running in context of a user's fork and thus havin the CI usage cost
ammoritized across all user's accounts.

In a merge request workflow, this pretty much "just works" because the
CI jobs alwas run in the user's fork before the merge request is opened,
or when force-pushed.

Assuming we're not adopting a merge request workflow in the near term,
I wonder if we could do something clever to improve our mailing list
workflow CI to get jobs running mostly in user's forks.

A large number of contributors use "git-publish" to send patches. That
is already capable of optionally pushing to a public git server for
pull requests.

What if we used git-publish to always push to gitlab when submitting
patches, and have it include the gitlab ref in the cover letter.

That would trigger CI jobs in the user's fork, and patchew would not
have to run anything itself. It would merely monitor the user's fork
and report back to the list if the job failed. Patchew would ony then
have to run stuff in its own shared fork if the user didn't include
a gitlab ref in their cover letter.  At least this works for x86
Linux stuff. Doesn't work for any scenario needing custom runners.

Still if our regular contributors went this way, the shared fork
could have much lower build job load than we see today.

The ideal situation is that we have one set of defined jobs that are
used universally by the person merging to git master, by patchew, by
any contributors before posting.

In terms of traditional build jobs, we have a huge number defined in
GitLab CI but it is only a partially overlapping set vs patchew,
principally because the GitLab jobs are x86 only. For the non-x86 stuff we would have to define
jobs that target custom runners and then have custom runners registered
against Patchew's account. If quota becomes a problem, we'd nede x86 custom
runners too.

The other useful part of patchew is the "checkpatch.pl" validation.
We should really create a job in GitLab CI that covers this, as it
is something that's useful for developers to get right before posting.

Daniel
