Yeah @Boris - it really seems to be an issue bound to the Merom/Penryn
processor generation.

I asked Andreas to check through some kernels and qemu versions so that
we maybe eventually can consider bisecting something. But that will take
a bit of time.

Of course everyone able to spend some time can consider checking a few
kernels of [1] as well (probably the easiest test to begin with).

Still if there is an x86-microarchitecture expert out there that say "ah
penryn, I know we added/dropped ... " please speak up :-)

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
