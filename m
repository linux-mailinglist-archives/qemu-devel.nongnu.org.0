I think you need to bear in mind that we're not using some crude AI
to apply blind enforcement of rules. The people responsible for any 
enforcement have the ability to apply common sense to situation and so
aren't likely to take action if someone complains about "publishing" an
email address by adding it to a CC on a thread / git commit message.

Similarly if you think you are not misbehaving, then almost always
that will indeed be the case. If someone did happen to disagree though,
then the CoC sets out a process for resolving the situation and that
process doesn't have to result in action being taken. It could easily
simply be a case of explaining a mis-understanding between two people,
and hopefully that would even be the common case.


If we don't have any CoC then that creates much worse uncertainty because
people who are on the receiving end of bad behaviour will have no idea
whether the QEMU project as a whole even cares about it, or whether it
is the kind of thing that will lead to action being taken, or whom to
talk to about it.

A CoC isn't going to magically stop all bad behaviour, but it does give
the victims clarity of what the expected standards of decency are, and
how to handle the situations. It also gives QEMU community members in
general confidence in speaking up if they see bad behaviour, instead of
having to wait for some senior project member to see the issue and take
action. We've been lucky in the past that when bad situations have arisen
on qemu-devel, the right senior people happened to be online and dealt
with it, but I would rather we had had a CoC then, that made it clearer.

Regards,
Daniel
