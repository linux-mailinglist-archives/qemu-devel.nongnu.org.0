Adding Gerd to the CC, since this is possibly caused by recent work to
keyboard state tracking code.

Title:
  4.0 breaks keyboard autorepeat in guests with xserver

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Description:
  In a linux/bsd guest within X, pressing and holding a key for a short tim=
e causes an endless repeat of that key in the guest. The release of the key=
 gets ignored.
  Example 1: pressing and holding 'a' for a few seconds results in typing o=
f 'aaaaaaaaaaaa...' endlessly.
  Example 2: pressing and holding 'Backspace' for a few seconds results in =
deleting all your previously typed text.

  It doesn't happen within a VT in the guest. It also doesn't happen
  with guests that run windows, reactos or haiku for example.

  The problem goes away when disabling xorgs autorepeat function via "xset =
-r" in the host.
  Normally, this setting should not have any effect on the guest, since it =
has it's own autorepeat setting. So there is some conflict here.

  Steps to reproduce:
  Start any linux/bsd guest system with xserver, open a terminal, press and=
 hold a key for a short time: Look how it gets typed endlessly (Try a few t=
imes if it doesn't happen immediately).
  The easiest way is to run a linux live cd, like this (Link to example iso=
 :http://download.grml.org/grml64-full_2018.12.iso)
  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 512 -net none -boot d -cdrom grml64-f=
ull_2018.12.iso
