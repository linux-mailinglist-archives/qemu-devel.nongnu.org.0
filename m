Unless I'm missing something, you don't have to recompile to pass
additional options.  The qtest binaries already read environment
variables QTEST_QEMU_BINARY and QTEST_QEMU_IMG.  Have them point to
suitable wrappers.

Perhaps there's still a need for a more convenient way.

The common (and sad) solution for this is to require whatever runs $PROG
at a different trust level to scrub the environment.

You're right, there is a difference between "also" and "only".  Audio
could only be configured via environment, and that was without doubt
awful.  Does not imply permitting trace configuration via environment
also would be similarly awful.

However, adding special cases as needed is what got us into the startup
mess Dan highlighted.  Are we confident tracing will remain the only
thing we also want to configure via environment?

I sympathize with Dan's plea for more uniform configuration interfaces.

This would fit into our existing use of the environment with qtest.  Try
grep '"QTEST_'.

Philippe, your commit message mentions just qtest.  That use case would
be covered by Dan's suggestion, wouldn't it?  If not, please explain.
If you have additional use cases, please state them.
