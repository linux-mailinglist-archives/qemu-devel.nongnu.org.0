How does introspection solve the problem? It requires the client to
actively look for a deprecation instead of notifying it that it is using
something deprecated.

Do you expect libvirt to check a full list of all QMP commands, types,
etc. it ever uses against the schema after starting a VM or something
like that?

Not quite, listify_cond() takes the condition it, not the entity that
contains it. But I can do this:

    self.features = features
    for f in self.features or []:
        f['if'] = listify_cond(f.get('if'))

I don't know what QAPISchemaMember is, and the documentation doesn't
tell me either. Its code looks related to generated C code, but features
don't generate C code.

I guess I could use it anyway and just never call any of its methods but
just use it to store things in attributes rather than dict entries, but
somehow creating an object and not making use of anything the class
provides feels like abuse.

Maybe I could be convinced otherwise if you suggest a docstring to add
to the QAPISchemaMember class that explains for which cases it is meant.

to_qlit() doesn't document what it expects for obj. From the code, if
it's a tuple, the first item is the content to generate and the second
item is a dict 'extra' that contains additional information. The 'if'
and 'comment' keys in it are used, the rest is silently ignored.

f is already a dict that satisfies the expectations of the to_qlit()
interface, so it feels unnecessary to duplicate it. But if we really
do want to duplicate it, it would look like this:

        if features:
            obj['features'] = [ (f['name'],
                                 {'if': f['if']} if 'if' in f else {})
                                for f in features ]

Or we could pull the condition one level up:

        if features:
            obj['features'] = [ (f['name'], {'if': f['if']})
                                if 'if' in f else f['name']
                                for f in features ]

I don't consider either way very readable compared to what I currently
have, but I'll make the change if you insist on it.
