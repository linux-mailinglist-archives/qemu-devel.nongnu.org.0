I found that field->flags is a bit-or field, so maybe all 0xf or other
magic number is still meaningful?  Can we use field->version_id or
field->struct_version_id as the condition?  I found they are all int
type but used as non-negative, so can we use
field->version_id/field->struct_version_id == magic number (for example,
-1) as a sentinel?
