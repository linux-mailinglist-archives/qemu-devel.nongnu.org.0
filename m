Catching up with this now. I was told about this last week at the KVM
Forum, but if the problems comes with the use of fallocate() and XFS,
the I don't think subclusters will solve it.

handle_alloc_space() is used to fill a cluster with zeroes when there's
COW, and that happens the same with subclusters, just at the subcluster
level instead of course.

What can happen, if the subcluster size matches the filesystem block
size, is that there's no need for any COW and therefore the bug is never
triggered. But that's not quite the same as a fix :-)

Maybe combining that with the smaller clusters/subclusters can work
around the problem. The maximum subcluster size is 64KB (for a 2MB
cluster).
