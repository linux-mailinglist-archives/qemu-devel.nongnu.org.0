What I meant for "arch-independent" is a test which does not have "arch"=20
tag. You call it "generic test". We can agree on use "generic test" for=20
better communication.

The absence of "arch" tag can means either 1) "run on all built targets"=20
or 2) "pick one target and run it".=C2=A0 I suggested x86_64 thinking on =
case=20
2) because it provides a default machine type that I supposed (I might=20
be indeed wrong) just works on most cases. Your follow up patch [1]=20
addresses the scenario 1) but allows the user to pick that one target of =
2).

All in all, we should agree on the semantic of "arch" when it is not=20
present. Should it be "any" or "all"? Configurable or not? Let's discuss=20
this on [1].

So NACK this patch.

[1] [RFC PATCH] Acceptance tests: run generic tests on all built targets

I could have used self.arch indeed. But notice that self.arch is None=20
when "arch" tag does not exist. So I still need to guess the=20
architecture from the binary.

Yep. Let's continue that discussion on your patch.

Thanks for the comments!
