The calc-time reported here should be in the same units as when it is
specified in calc-dirty-rate (seconds for both seems fine).

I suspect that providing the start-timestamp in seconds would also be
fine - it's not obvious that knowing the value in milliseconds adds much
value.

It should be possible to initiate measurement when the state is either
UNSTARTED or MEASURED - only MEASURING should rule it out.
