=46rom the looks of it, I don't think we would have seen that big
performance degradation had this patch been included. I can give
it a spin if you like. Shall I?

>=20

I can confirm, that your description covers my scenario. I didn't
investigate what happens when we have an intel-iommu, because s390 does
not do intel-iommu. I can also confirm that no performance degradation
is observed when the virtio-net has iommu_platform=3Doff. The property
iommu_platform is a virtio device (and not a backend) level property.

>=20

The problem is that the virtio feature bit F_ACCESS_PLATFORM, which is
directly controlled by the iommu_platform proprerty stands for two things
1) need to do IOVA translation
2) the access of the device to the guests RAM is restricted.

There are cases where 2) does apply and 1) does not. We need to specify
iommu_platform=3Don to make the virtio implementation in the guest use
the dma api, because we need to grant access to memory as required. But
we don't need translation and we don't have a vIOMMU.

Halil
