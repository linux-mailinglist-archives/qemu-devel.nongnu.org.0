This makes migration-test faster by observing that most of the pre-copy
tests don't need to be doing a live migration. They get sufficient code
coverage with the guest CPUs paused.

On my machine this cuts the overall execution time of migration-test
by 50% from 15 minutes, down to 8 minutes, without sacrificing any
noticeable code coverage.

This is still quite slow though.

The auto-converge and xbzrle tests are top because they both inherantly
*need* todo multiple interations in order to exercise the desired
code paths.

The post-copy tests are all up there because we always do one iteration
of pre-copy before switching to post-copy and we need to ensure that we
don't complete before getting to the post-copy bit.

I think we can optimize the post-copy bit though. Only 1 of the
post-copy tests really needs to go through a full pre-copy iteration
to get good code coverage.  For the other post-copy tests we can change
to let it copy 10 MBs of data in pre-copy mode and then switch to
post-copy.

    tests/migration: Tweek auto converge limits check

we cut the bandwidth by factor of x10 to ensure reliability. I think
that was perhaps too aggressive. If we bump it back up to say 10 MB/sec
that's still better than the original 30 MB/sec, perhaps enough to give
us reliability, while cutting time of other tests by 70%
