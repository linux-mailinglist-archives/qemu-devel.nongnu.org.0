Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] blockdev: avoid acquiring AioContext lock twice at

do_drive_backup() acquires the AioContext lock of the corresponding
BlockDriverState. This is not a problem when it's called from
qmp_drive_backup(), but drive_backup_prepare() also acquires the lock
before calling it. The same things happens with do_blockdev_backup()
and blockdev_backup_prepare().

This patch series merges do_drive_backup() with drive_backup_prepare()
and do_blockdev_backup() with blockdev_backup_prepare(), and ensures
they're only getting called from a transaction context. This way,
there's a single code path for both transaction requests and qmp
commands, as suggested by Kevin Wolf.

We also take this opportunity to ensure we're honoring the context
acquisition semantics required by bdrv_try_set_aio_context, as
suggested by Max Reitz.

Changelog:

v3:
 - Rework the whole patch series to fix the issue by consolidating all
   operations in the transaction model. (thanks Kevin Wolf)

v2:
 - Honor bdrv_try_set_aio_context() context acquisition requirements
   (thanks Max Reitz).
 - Release the context at drive_backup_prepare() instead of avoiding
   re-acquiring it at do_drive_baclup(). (thanks Max Reitz)
 - Convert a single patch into a two-patch series.
