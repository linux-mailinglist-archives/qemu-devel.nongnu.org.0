I guess we're looking at different places then, as all of the large
scale virt mgmt apps I've experianced with KVM (OpenStack, oVirt,
KubeVirt), along with the small scale ones (GNOME Boxes, virt-manager,
virt-install, Cockpit), etc all primarily use SeaBIOS, and in more
recently times a bit of UEFI.  Direct kernel/initrd boot is usualy
reserved for special cases, since users like to be able to manage
their kernel/initrd inside the guest image.

Ok, useful info.

What's the problem with it ? fw_cfg is a pretty straightforward
mechanism for injecting data into the guest OS, that we already
use for alot of stuff.

I'm not trying to sink an idea. If this turns out to be the best
idea, I've no problem with that.

I merely asked some reasonable questions about whether there were
alternative approaches that could solve more broadly useful scenarios,
given the narrow usage of direct kernel boot, in context of the common
VM deployments I've seen at large scale. You can't expect reviewers to
blindly accept any proposal without considering it broader context.

With regards,
Daniel
