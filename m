Hi,

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-05/msg00569.html
shows that optimizations affect HDDs and SSDs differently.  It would be
nice if we could differentiate between the two and then choose to adjust
our behavior depending on whether a given image is stored on an HDD or
not.

Or maybe it isn=E2=80=99t so nice.  That=E2=80=99s one reason this is an =
RFC.

The other is that I implemented recognition of the rotational status by
querying sysfs.  That looks stupid, but I didn=E2=80=99t find a better wa=
y
(there is a BLKROTATIONAL ioctl, but that only works on device files).

But, hey, if you look through block/file-posix.c, you=E2=80=99ll find tha=
t I=E2=80=99m
not the first to query sysfs.  hdev_get_max_segments() does so, too.  So
maybe it isn=E2=80=99t that bad of an idea.


What do you think?  Is the whole idea stupid?  Just the implementation?
Or does it make sense?
