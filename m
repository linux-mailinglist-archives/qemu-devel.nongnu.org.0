Yes, this is what I posted yesterday. (With a suggested quick fix, but
it turns out it was not quite correct, see below.)

Ok, I'll try that later.

Yes, we need to write zeroes to the new area if the backing file covers
it. We need to do this not only in mirror/commit/bdrv_commit(), but in
fact for all truncate operations: Berto mentioned on IRC yesterday that
you can get into the same situation with 'block_resize' monitor
commands.

So I tried to fix this yesterday, and I thought that I had a fix, when I
noticed that bdrv_co_do_zero_pwritev() takes a 32 bit bytes parameter.
So I'll still need to fix this. Other than that, I suppose the following
fix should work (but is probably a bit too invasive for -rc3).
