The IEEE6 test comes down to:

    target/arm: Make FPSCR/FPCR trapped-exception bits RAZ/WI

    The {IOE, DZE, OFE, UFE, IXE, IDE} bits in the FPSCR/FPCR are for
    enabling trapped IEEE floating point exceptions (where IEEE exception
    conditions cause a CPU exception rather than updating the FPSR status
    bits). QEMU doesn't implement this (and nor does the hardware we're
    modelling), but for implementations which don't implement trapped
    exception handling these control bits are supposed to be RAZ/WI.
    This allows guest code to test for whether the feature is present
    by trying to write to the bit and checking whether it sticks.

    QEMU is incorrectly making these bits read as written. Make them
    RAZ/WI as the architecture requires.

    In particular this was causing problems for the NetBSD automatic
    test suite.

Title:
  Regressions on arm-linux-gnueabihf target with some GCC tests

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  Hi,

  After trying qemu master:
  commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
  Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
  Author: Peter Maydell <email address hidden>
  Date: Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

  even with the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1834496,
  I've noticed several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GC=
C testsuite.
  I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed s=
hared libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

  All tests used to pass w/o error, but with a recent qemu, all of them
  make qemu crash.

  This was noticed with GCC master configured with
  --target arm-none-linux-gnueabihf
  --with-cpu cortex-a57
  --with-fpu crypto-neon-fp-armv8

  Thanks
