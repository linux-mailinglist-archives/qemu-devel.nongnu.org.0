Hmm ... I hadn't considered it was possible, but actually ... I guess I 
can split those out, yeah.

Admittedly I am going by trial and error; my experience is that the 
relative imports behave the nicest.

There is a historical fear of explicit relative imports because they are 
"new" and years of Python2 compatibility rendered many afraid of them. 
It is advice safely ignored in my opinion.

Using absolute imports (e.g. from qapi.sibling import foo) gets messy in 
virtual environments when you have *installed* the module in question: 
it becomes ambiguous as to *which* qapi you meant: the one in this 
folder, or the one installed to the environment?

Python, mypy, pylint, flake8 etc disagree sometimes, or can get 
confused; thinking there are two copies of each module.

Just my experience that relative imports seem to give me the least trouble.

I'd have to code up some examples. I have some hobby code unrelated to 
QEMU where I struggled to get flake8, mypy, and pylint all cooperating 
with an import regime until I gave up and used explicit relative imports.

I was thinking of changing this myself, so this convinced me.

This is a mistake. I tried to convince git to "move" the old file and 
then add a "new" file to preserve history, but of course that's not how 
git manages file histories, so it didn't work.

TLDR: I didn't delete the license blurb, I just didn't "add" it again.
I'll "fix" that.
