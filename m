Yes, setting max_read and making larger requests an error seems like a
good solution.

Yes.

Hm, the libfuse documentation doesn't say anything about draining. I
suppose this is because if requests need to be drained, it will do so in
the kernel. But I haven't checked the code.

So I expect that calling fsync() on the lower layer does everything that
is needed. Which is bdrv_flush() in QEMU.

> Or is it the opposite, flush should just drain and not invoke

I'm just relying on the libfuse documentation there for flush:

"This is called on each close() of the opened file."

and

"NOTE: the name of the method is misleading, since (unlike fsync) the
filesystem is not forced to flush pending writes. One reason to flush
data is if the filesystem wants to return write errors during close.
However, such use is non-portable because POSIX does not require close
to wait for delayed I/O to complete."

Implementing .flush(), which will be called when the image is closed,
with blk_flush().

And still doing blk_flush() for .fsync, of course.

I'm not exactly sure what failure of .flush() would look like for users.
Probably close() failing, so they don't have to do anything special,
just check their return values.
