In my company, we do have both Octeon (don't know at this moment what
version) and Boston systems.

Boston seems to me as a very good candidate for enabling RAM > 2GB. I never
saw it phisically, since it is assigned to a different department, but just
anectodaly I heard that it is designed as a desktop (or even server)
machine, and, therefore, it almost certainly supports > 2GB.

Given current circumstances of remote work for most of us, and limited
movement, it may be somewhat difficult for me to access it, but it is not
imposible.

Please take everything I said in this email with a grain of salt, since it
is based more on hallway chats, rather than on facts.

I'll try to get more info, hopefully soon.

Yours,
Aleksandar
