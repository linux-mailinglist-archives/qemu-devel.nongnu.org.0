I think the key thing to understand is that once you involve a "jailer"
then "QEMU" is no longer a single thing we can refer to. It is immediately
split into two pieces, "the launcher" and "the runtime", with a jailer
sitting in between the pair.

The configuration information needed by the launcher is a superset
of the information needed by the runtime. The launcher is trustworthy
and the runtime is untrustworthy.

In the current world qemu-system-* is the runtime and libvirt is
the launcher, and they each have their own completely different
vocabulary for configuration.

Essentially what you're talking about is a way to bring the concept
of the launcher under the responsibility of the QEMU project, and
have much closer alignment between the configuration for the launcher
and the runtime. One would still need to be the superset of the
other, but they could be 90% common.=20

Having "the launcher" be part of the QEMU project deliverables is
a completely reasonable concept. Libvirt only took on that role
itself because QEMU has never provided any solution for this
problem itself.  I don't think this is a technically difficult
task. The issues are simply around the practicality of the size/
scope of the work required in order to achieve deliver it for the
diverse range of QEMU functionality & use cases.

Daniel
