I'm OK with it being a URI; just drop the https.

Yes, but I think it might be worth calling out these differences;  there
are explicitly cases where you don't want external changes to be visible
and other cases where you do; both are valid, but both need thinking
about. (Another one, GPU whether you have a monitor plugged in!)

I think something like 'Some part of a devices state may be irrelevant
to a migration; for example on some NICs it might be preferable to hide
the physical characteristics of the link from the guest.'

We've generally found the definition of devices tends in practice to be
done newer->older; i.e. you define the current machine, and then define
the next older machine setting the defaults that used to be true; then
define the older version behind that....

There are some corner cases that people sometimes prefer; for example
lets say the X=5 case is actually really rare - but when it happens the
device is hopelessly broken, some device authors prefer to fix it and
send the extra data and let the migration fail if the destination
doesn't understand it (it would break anyway).  I've also been asked
by mst for a 'unexpected data' mechanism to send data that the
destination might not expect if it didn't know about it, for similar
cases.

A similar suggestion had come up in the vfio thread with Nvidia
some months ago; I can't remember the outcome of that.
(Much of this thread repeats the repeated long discussions on that
thread!)
