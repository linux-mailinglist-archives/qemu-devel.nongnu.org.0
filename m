Er, yes.  Point is, the graph structure below with @base at the root may
be different than the one right below @base_overlay.

Yes, and I don=E2=80=99t think this currently working case is broken by thi=

Which it does not have yet, right?  Which is why I was saying that I
don=E2=80=99t think this is a problem with this series.  We could try to ad=
dress
it later.

Or do you think we can=E2=80=99t address it later because right now all fil=
ter
cases are broken anyway so now would be the time to make a breaking
change (which the suggestion to not use @base as the final backing node is)=
?

stream2-filter would be on top of mid2, right?

Note that the user first needs to pass =E2=80=9Cmid2=E2=80=9D as the base t=
o the stream
job stream1.  Why don=E2=80=99t they just pass =E2=80=9Cstream2-filter=E2=
=80=9D?  In my model,
the user should specify exactly which node they want not to be touched
by this stream job, and so that would be stream2-filter, not mid1.

I feel like the answer to this question has to do with implicit nodes.
AFAIU you wanted to remove them, so I don=E2=80=99t think we=E2=80=99d want=
 to
special-case them here.

If you think that we can=E2=80=99t expect users to pass =E2=80=9Cstream2-fi=
lter=E2=80=9D because
currently it should work with =E2=80=9Cmid2=E2=80=9D, then that=E2=80=99s a=
 case of implicit
nodes and it means we should ascend from @base up to the first
non-implicit node to get the @above_base we want.

I don=E2=80=99t think it will work as expected because users can no longer
specify which node should be the base node after streaming.  And the
QAPI schema says that base-node is to become the backing file of the top
node after streaming.

I suppose you=E2=80=99re arguing that streaming through filters basically j=
ust
doesn=E2=80=99t work at all right now, so we=E2=80=99re free to do whatever=
?

Well, that still leaves the problem that users should be able to specify
which node is to become the base after streaming, and that that node
maybe shouldn=E2=80=99t be restricted to immediate children of COW images.

Besides the question of whether the top job could just use the bottom
job=E2=80=99s filter node as the base, there=E2=80=99s also the alternative=
 of admitting
defeat and declaring that you just cannot use a single node in two
streams, because we didn=E2=80=99t find a way to make it work after all.

You could still create a temporary overlay in between that=E2=80=99s never =
used
and then drop it with a trivial stream afterwards.

(But that just in case specifying the bottom job=E2=80=99s stream node some=
how
wouldn=E2=80=99t work.)

Well, it is intended to remove nodes.  You can only remove data-bearing
nodes by moving data around.  I suspect if there was a way to get the
to-be-removed nodes removed without having to move their data around,
that would be popular.

Yes.

Although it could be argued that it is a handy way to remove filters, in
a backing chain at least.  (Thanks to bdrv_find_overlay(), @base and
@top still need to refer to different levels of the backing chain, but
if we lifted that restriction, I suppose it could work for any filter
chain.)

*shrug*

I don=E2=80=99t think so, actually.  Like, you have a throttle node somewhe=
re in
the chain, shouldn=E2=80=99t you maybe want to move it down below the chain=
?  Or
a COR node, shouldn=E2=80=99t that go above the chain after streaming?

I=E2=80=99m not making an argument here, I just don=E2=80=99t quite underst=
and why you=E2=80=99d
bring up what happens with intermediate filters here.  The only reason
to drop them is because that=E2=80=99s what I expect users to expect of the
stream job.

Hm.  The documentation seems the same to me.  Either it=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9C=
The backing
node (at the end of the job) of @base=E2=80=99s parent node (when starting =
the
job)=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CThe backing node (at the end of the job) of the n=
ext
non-filter node above @base (when starting the job)=E2=80=9D.

The problem you describe (that @above_base at the end of the job isn=E2=80=
=99t
necessarily above @base anymore) also exists with your suggestion,
namely that you can add overlays above @base after the job has started,
so @base_overlay at the end of the job isn=E2=80=99t necessarily the first
non-filter node above @base anymore.


OK, so after all this text, maybe some more original problem searching.
 I think it the root of the problem is that the stream job takes a @base
parameter, but as of c624b015bf14fe01, it doesn=E2=80=99t really matter any=
more.
 Maybe c624b015bf14fe01 should have introduced a new parameter for users
to specify the bottom node instead of @base.

Well, that would have made everything a parameter mess, but it would
have saved us the trouble now.

In any case, the problem we have now is that we want a way to
automagically find out which node the bottom node should be, because the
user can=E2=80=99t specify it.  So the documentation is always going to be
written as =E2=80=9CThe backing node (at the end of the job) of $bottom=E2=
=80=9D, where
=E2=80=9C$bottom=E2=80=9D is what we=E2=80=99re interested in figuring out.

I thought it would be best if we stick as close as possible to the
spirit of the current documentation, which basically requires @base-node
to be the backing node of the top after streaming.  (If you do graph
modifications during the job, that=E2=80=99s on you, because since
c624b015bf14fe01 we can=E2=80=99t keep the base frozen.)

Your suggestion to do basically what you consider to be right, which
comes at the caveat of being untruthful to the current documentation
even if there are no graph modifications during the job.  Luckily, the
stream job right now doesn=E2=80=99t work in the cases we=E2=80=99re lookin=
g at, so it
wouldn=E2=80=99t be a breaking change.  The problem I have with it is that
you=E2=80=99re assuming what is right and what isn=E2=80=99t (i.e. =E2=80=
=9CWho would want to
remove filter nodes directly above @base=E2=80=9D) without giving the user =
a
chance to specify.


I think it would be nice if we could have something that remains
truthful to the current documentation.  If just ignoring implicit
filters above @base would work, then I=E2=80=99d find that nice.  If it doe=
sn=E2=80=99t,
I suppose there=E2=80=99s indeed little we can do but to indeed forego
@above_base and just use @base_overlay for all cases.
