Short for Virtual Machine eXecutable. Sigh.  People do come up with
names that aren't great. I don't even know whether vmware was there
first and intel shouldn't have shortened virtual machine extensions to
vmx, but in KVM and QEMU it's quite entrenched by now. So let's try to
avoid this in code. If you like how about VMPortExec and
vm-exec-version?  Also lets you use CamelCase consistently and not a mix
of underscores and CamelCase.

Right if you want this for debugging, prefix property with "x-" so it does
not need to be maintained. Point being, maintaining low level interfaces
has real cost ...
