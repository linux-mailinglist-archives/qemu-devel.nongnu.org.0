IIRC there was another odd dependency that the PCI devices need their=20
ROM also on non-x86 systems... but that's another story...

I noticed that there are also some iotests that use bzip2 ... they are=20
not used during the build process, but still, it might be better to=20
simply always require bzip2, also in case some other architectures want=20
to use it. So I'm also fine if we simply always require bzip2 for the build=
.

PS: Anybody interested in writing a patch to compress the other big=20
binaries in the pc-bios folder, too? ... skiboot.lid ...=20
openbios-sparc64 ... ppc_rom.bin ...
