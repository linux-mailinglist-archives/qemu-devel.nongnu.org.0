arm_pmu driver was reworked to use pseudo-NMIs. I don't know the exact
status of this work though
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11047407/). So we cannot use any
random NMI for guest injection.

I wonder whether we should implement the KVM_NMI vcpu ioctl once we have
agreed on which behavior is expected upon NMI injection. However the
kernel doc says this ioctl only is well defined if "KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP
has not been called" (?).
