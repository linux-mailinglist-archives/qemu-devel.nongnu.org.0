I'm not familiar with this machine.  You make me suspect the serial
thingy is a component of a larger device.

Properly modelled, a composite device has its components as children.
These appear below their parent in the QOM composition tree.

Example: a "serial-isa" device has a "serial" component.  When the
former is at /machine/unattached/device[28]/, the latter is at
/machine/unattached/device[28]/serial/.

I guess that's what you want for macio's serial port.

Counter-example: a "isa-super-io" device has compoenents of type
"isa-parallel", "isa-serial", "isa-fdc", "i8042", "isa-ide".
Nevertheless, these appear next to their parent in /machine/unattached/.
I'm still too much of a QOM ignoramus to explain why that's so.  Paolo,
can you?

Paolo, could link properties achieve that?

Mark, I guess you want the alias / link from builtin/nic0 to the actual
place to simplify configuration: the user then needs to know less about
the board.  Correct?
