After speaking with Alex & Laine on IRC, I learnt some further relevant
points

 - In a "typical" physical machine PCI slots will not be marked
   as hotpluggable - /sys/bus/pci/slots only has 2 entries on
   my HP DL180, corresponding to unused physical PCI slots
  =20
 - QEMU is hardcoded to report all pci & pcie-root-ports as hotpluggable.
   So /sys/bus/pci/slots on i440fx has 31 entries, one for every
   device, while on q35 it has one entry for every pcie-root-port
   IIUC.

 - It is conceptually possible to enhance pcie-root-port device
   to allow its hotplug capability to be toggled. Alternatively
   a parallel  pcie-root-port-nohotplug device could be created.
   The end result would be the same from guest POV

 - The vfio-pci device has a companion vfio-pci-nohotplug
   device. The difference is simply whether the QEMU DEviceClass
   has the "hotpluggable" attribute set, and is separate from
   whether the PCI(e) root port has hotplug enabled


The last point here about vfio-pci si particularly important,
as it shows libvirt needs to be capable of tracking hotpluggability
independantly on the PCI port and the PCI device attached to the
port.

[snip]

This is essentially a hack to work around the fact the the pcie-root-port
is hardcoded to report itself as hotpluggable.

As such I don't consider this is serious long term solution. If you
absolutely cannot wait for a newer libvirt/QEMU, this solution could
be used as a quick hack for mgmt apps, but long term we need todo
better.

Essentially this is the using "hotpluggable=3Dyes|no" on the device as
a policy knob to control device placement, to again workaround the
fact that pcie-root-port are hardcoded to always report themselves
as hotpluggable.

So I'd think this should be ruled out for the same reason as
option 1.

It has a second downside though. As we see from vfio-pci-nohotplug,
there is a valid use case for a "hotpluggable=3Dyes|no" attribute on
a device for controlling a specific hardware config choice in QEMU.

We don't want to overload this attribute to both control use of
vfio-pci-nohotplug, and also be a policy knob for device placement.

I think this, or something close to it is the desirable way forward
here, as it gives us more explicit control over what the emulated
hardware actually advertizes. So instead of trying to workaround
limitations of QEMU, we'd be working /with/ QEMU to improve its
feature offerings.

In QEMU pcie-root-port either needs to gain a hotpluggable=3Dyes|no
attribute, or a second pcie-root-port-nohotplug needs adding.

Withever of these two approaches are taken in QEMU, this can be
controlled from libvirt via an attribute on the controller.eg

   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotpluggable=3D"no|yes=
"/>

This hotpluggable attribute can be mapped to whichever CLI syntax
QEMU wants to support.

This alone is probably sufficient for the Windows problem motivating
this thread.

There already exists the vfio-pci-nohotplug device, but this is not
exposed by libvirt. So we can add an attribute to <hostdev> to
control its use.

The remaining question is whether there's any compelling reason to
add non-hotpluggable variants of other devices, virtio-net-pci-nohotplug ?

I'd probably /not/ do this, unless there's a clear compelling benefit
it gives which can't be achieved already via the pcie-root-port
hotpluggability controls.


For management applications, with Q35 we already recommend that they
explicitly add *many*

   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port'/>

to new guests. Enough to cover all the initial cold-plugged devices,
and enough spare ports to enable future hotplug of extra devices.
OpenStack for example will add 32 pcie-root-ports, so that Q35 has
approximately the same hotplug capacity as i440fx would have offered.

To control hotplug, management apps simply need tweak what they're
doing with pcie-root-ports with an extra attribute

eg, consider there were 4 devices on the initially booted VM which
need hotplug disabled, and we still want freedom to hotplug 2
extra devices at runtime.

   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"no"/>
   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"no"/>
   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"no"/>
   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"no"/>
   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"yes"/>
   <controller type=3D'pci' model=3D'pcie-root-port' hotplug=3D"yes"/>

This is quite easy, as applications still do *not* have to taken on
responsibility for full PCI device addressing. They merely need to
be able to count how many PCI devices they're using. The only "gotcha"
is if they forget about the auto-added USB, VGA and Balloon devices,
but that's not a big deal.
