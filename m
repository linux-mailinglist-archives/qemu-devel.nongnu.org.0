The split exists so you can set property values between instance_init()
and realize().  It's how qdev has always worked.  It permits setting
properties one by one even when this results in intermediate states
where invariants involving multiple property values are violated: delay
checking them until realize(), rely on them only while the device is
realized.

Note that both realize() and unrealize() can fail.  instance_init() and
instance_finalize() can't.

In theory, you can realize + unrealize multiple times.  It might even
work in practice sometimes.

Not doing so risks introspection leaks or double-frees.
