I'd suggest we need a bare minimum of half a development cycle to.
So if we want it tin 5.2, we need to make a strong push now and over
next month to review it and iron out any obvious blocking testing
problems.

In terms of testing I'd suggest the minimium bar is likely the GitLab CI
and Peter's merge scripts.

Anything beyond that is just nice to have.

Yep, there's no substitute for getting it used for real by a wide
range of people, which is why we we need leave ourselves at min
1/2 a dev cycle for this.
