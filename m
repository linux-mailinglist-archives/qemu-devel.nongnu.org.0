I made the mistake of trying to run the iotests with all non-default
subformats our vmdk driver has to offer:
- monolithicFlat
- twoGbMaxExtentSparse
- twoGbMaxExtentFlat
- streamOptimized

Many things broke, so this series fixes what I found.  It=E2=80=99s mostl=
y just
iotest fixes, but there are actually two real fixes in here.


v2:
- Patch 2: Don=E2=80=99t treat extent filenames with protocol prefixes as
  absolute filenames =E2=80=93 this may be the right thing to do, but:
  (1) path_combine() doesn=E2=80=99t (it just ignores whether the suppose=
d
      relative filename has a potential protocol prefix), so this is how
      we handled it so far,
  (2) It would break other cases (when a filename contains a colon for
      no particular reason), as seen in iotest 126.
  That means you cannot have an extent file e.g. on an http server while
  the descriptor is on a local filesystem, but I hope nobody would ever
  want to do that.

- Patch 3: Fix paste-o [John]

- Patch 7: twoGbMaxExtentSparse works now with the change to patch 2, so
  we no longer have to mark it unsupported [Thanks for the insistent
  inquiry, John :-)]
