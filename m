Yes. Radix MMU is the default for Linux under POWER9 but it can also
use Hash.

For PowerNV, "machine" would be more appropriate. We sometime refer to 
it as L0 and the sublevel guests as L1 and L2.

I think this would be a fix for the model.

It seems to makes sense. I just want to give it a try using an emulated 
QEMU PowerNV machine running a KVM pseries guest to see if it doesn't
break anything. Which would mean that the fix is incomplete.

OK.
