Yeah I think you're right.  I might have confused with some previous
implementations.  Maybe we should also do similar thing for DSI/GI just like
what we do in PSI.

The only caller of memory_region_iommu_replay() is vfio_listener_region_add(),
when there's a new vIOMMU memory region detected.  So IIUC that guarantees the
previous state should be all empty.
