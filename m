Sounds OK to me personally.

In your experience, would that limit satisfy (for example) the CoreOS /
Ignition use case?

I think the 32-bit entry point is sufficient for x86.

If memory serves, we only started to care about the 64-bit entry point
for aarch64. See for example

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/ca6d61b22658

x86 always has RAM under 4GB though.
