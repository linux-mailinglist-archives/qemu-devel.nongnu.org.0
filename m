Yes, I read the code. My question was more if there is a reason why we
want things to look like this in the external interface.

I just thought that it was confusing that migration is already called
completed when it will still change the runstate. But I guess the
opposite could be confusing as well (if we're in postmigrate, why should
the migration status still change?)

In any case, I seem to remember that it's inconsistent between source
and destination. On one side, the migration status is updated first, on
the other side the runstate is updated first.

Commit 37ff7d70 changed it to wait for "postmigrate" on the source and
"running" on the destination, which I guess is good enough for a test
case that doesn't expect failure.
