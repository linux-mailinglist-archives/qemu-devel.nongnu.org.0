When the time comes to switch to Meson, we'll be forcing a
separate build directory & that will also potentially involve
a change in build instructions for users.

So if we expect Meson will arrive in QEMU soon (say before end
of this year), then I'd try to keep changes related to make to
the bare minimum, and have Meson switch as the "flag day" when
developers are forced to adapt their build process.=20

IOW, merely warn people that in-tree builds are deprecated and
not tested by the project and enourage switching to out of tree
builds. Dont try to magically create a separate build dir now.

Regards,
Daniel
