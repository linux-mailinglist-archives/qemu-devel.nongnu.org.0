So yesterday Stefanha brought up need for "mgmt apis" on the
virtiofsd helper process & the conclusion is that dbus makes
most sense for this purpose:

  https://www.redhat.com/archives/virtio-fs/2019-August/msg00339.html

This use case is a slightly different from vmstate though.

For vmstate we have two parties - virtiofsd and QEMU talking

For the "mgmt apis" in virtiofsd, we have arbitrary parties
involved - virtiofsd *and* an admin client tool, and/or
maybe libvirt.

I think this different scenario means that we do in fact need
to have a bus present, as the p2p model doesn't scale well
to many clients.

Even if we have 1 dbus-daemon per QEMU instance, we need to cope
with multiple instances of the same helper needing to connect.
So we need to come up with some for identifying services. Normally
DBus only allows 1 peer to own a given well known service name at
any time.  So we can't simply talk to a well-known 'org.qemu.virtiofsd'
service name.

Each service would need to to just rely on exporting objects under
its unique service id  (they look like :1.NNNN for some uniq NNN)

QEMU still needs to known which connections on the bus are actually
providing vhost-user services, and which are other things (like
libvirt or random mgmt tools)

So perhaps QEMU should expose a service  'org.qemu.VhostUserManager'
with an object /org/qemu/VhostUSerManager

Each helper supporting vmstate could register its existance
by invoking a method

   org.qemu.VhostUserManager.Register(":1.NNNN")

For things we want every vhost user daemon to implement, we can
define well known objects paths & intefaces to expose at the path.

eg If the helper supports vmstate dump, it should export an object
at the well known path "/org/qemu/VMState" with methods x, y & z

If the helper supports debug logging it should export an object at
the well known path "/org/qemu/Logger" with method a, b & c

etc

Daniel
