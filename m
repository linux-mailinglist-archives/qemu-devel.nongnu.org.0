Paolo and Peter, thanks for your time on the discussion. So I think the
conclusion is we don't do anything for pl011 either? :)

Actually, the issue was reported by libvirt developer. A VM is started
with serial on tcp socket, which is never accepted on server side. It
practically blocks the VM to boot up. I will tell the libvirt developer
to hack their code to avoid the race if we don't do anything in qemu.

Thanks,
Gavin
