Hi Andrzej,

Thanks for working on this!

FWIW, I have implemented other stuff for the NVMe device that requires
persistent storage (e.g. LBA allocation tracking for DULBE support). I
used the approach of adding an additional blockdev and simply use the
qemu block layer. This would also make it work on WIN32. And if we just
set bit 0 in PMRWBM and disable the write cache on the blockdev we
should be good on the durability requirements.

Unfortunately, I do not see (or know, maybe Stefan has an idea?) an easy
way of using the MemoryRegionOps nicely with async block backend i/o. so
we either have to use blocking I/O or fire and forget aio. Or, we can
maybe keep bit 1 set in PMRWBM and force a blocking blk_flush on PMRSTS
read.

Finally, a thing to consider is that this is adding an optional NVMe 1.4
feature to an already frankenstein device that doesn't even implement
mandatory v1.2. I think that bumping the NVMe version to 1.4 is out of
the question until we actually implement it fully wrt. mandatory
features. My patchset brings the device up to v1.3 and I have v1.4 ready
for posting, so I think we can get there.
