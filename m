Good idea. We can drop step 4 too:

    [0x0] Command data 2: (DWORD access, little endian)
          If the "CPU selector" value last stored by the guest refers to
          an impossible CPU, then 0.

This is skipped by step 2.

          Otherwise, if the "Command field" value last stored by the
          guest differs from 3, then 0.

This is triggered by step 3.

So step 4 does not look necessary. (As long as the guest is OK with the
selector ending up with a changed value.)

          Otherwise, the most significant 32 bits of the selected CPU's
          architecture specific ID.

Not relevant for this use case.

I like the "Command data 2" register more. The "temporal domain" is
always a complication in register definitions.

No, in the firmware, all this is strictly x86 code. The ArmVirtQemu
guest firmware has no support for multiprocessing at this time, to my
understanding.

(Nonetheless, if the register block got placed at an MMIO base address
on arm/virt, I think "unassigned_mem_ops" would apply there just the same.)

Thanks!
