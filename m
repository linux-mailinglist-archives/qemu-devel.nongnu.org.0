&gt; for the last few months.=C2=A0 A good explanation of why this isn&#39;=

&gt; would be absolutely critical.<br>
<br>
As you can see from that diagram, the history ppc CPUs is quite a bit<br>
more diverse than x86.=C2=A0 Although they&#39;re all very similar from the=
<br>
point of view of userspace code, they&#39;re quite different for<br>
privileged kernel code: they have different MMUs, different privileged<br>
registers amongst other things.<br>
<br>
Because of this there are several different KVM implementations.<br>
<br>
1) KVM HV<br>
<br>
This one uses the virtualization facilities of BookS CPUs (present<br>
since POWER4 / 970, but only well supported from POWER7 onwards).<br>
Those don&#39;t allow much to virtualize the guest cpu model, so it<br>
assumes the guest cpu is the same as the host.<br>
<br>
So, both your guest and host CPUs rule this one out.<br>
<br>
2) Book3E KVM<br>
<br>
Uses the virtualization features of recent enough Freescale Book E<br>
CPUs.=C2=A0 I don&#39;t know a lot about this or its limitations.=C2=A0 The=
 e6500<br>
might well have these features, but I&#39;m pretty sure it can only<br>
emulate BookE cpus for the guest.<br>
<br>
So, your guest rules this one out.<br>
<br>
3) KVM PR<br>
<br>
This one operates by running the entire guest in user mode, and<br>
emulating all privileged instructions.=C2=A0 It&#39;s slow (relative to<br>
hardware assisted KVM models), but it&#39;s flexible.<br>
<br>
In theory, this one can do what you want, but there are a bunch of<br>
caveats:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 * Emulating all the privileged instructions for a whole bunch of cpu=
<br>
=C2=A0 variants is a huge task, and KVM PR is now barely maintained.=C2=A0 =
