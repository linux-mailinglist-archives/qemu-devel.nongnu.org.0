I think the challenge is that osdep.h is too big as it exists
today. The stuff the needs to come before system headers is
actually little more than config-host.h and a few #defines
most of which are specific to windows. If those critical
#defines went into config-host.h, then we could have a rule
'config-host.h' must be included in all .c files as the first
thing. All the header files could just reference the specific
system headers they care about instead of making everything
from osdep.h visible in their namespace.  Still this would be
quite a lot of work to adapt to at this point.

With regards,
Daniel
