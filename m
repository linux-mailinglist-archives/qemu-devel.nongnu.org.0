So you reduced the dependency as SPD -> RAM, which is clever because
we won't have DIMM without RAM =)

Suggestion for new prototype (eeprom content populated in callee):

  SMBusEEPROMDevice spd_eeprom_new(MemoryDeviceState *memdev,
                                   const char *eeprom_name,
                                   I2CBus *smbus,
                                   uint8_t i2c_address);

The SPD describes the @memdev (which is its parent).
We can still modify the eeprom content after its creation.
