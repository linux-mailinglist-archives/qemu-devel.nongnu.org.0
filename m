My understanding is that "zeros" is the correct plural of "zero" (and
that "zeroes" relates to the use of "zero" as a verb), but perhaps
that's another British English thing?

I don't care enough to fight about it.

Given your patchset that improves the general behaviour of zero
detection, I'm definitely inclined to leave the backing file case alone
in this patch.

Convincing myself that a newly created image can only ever read as zero
will take a little more time, which I'm happy to spend if it's
considered significant.
