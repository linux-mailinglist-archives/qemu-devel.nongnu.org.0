From below description In understand you then bind this emulated device
to VFIO on guest, correct?

The QEMU virtio-iommu device executes commands from the virtio-iommu
driver and my understanding is the VFIO infra is not in trouble here. As
suggested by Jean, a detach command probably is missed.

I can help testing too
