In my opinion, the patch you mention is malformed.

I saved it to a local file with Thunderbird, saved the base64-encoded
body to a separate file, and decoded it with a naked "base64 --decode"
invocation. The result is a file with CRLF line terminators.

When someone sends a base64-encoded patch email, that's a statement
(again: IMO) that the patch conforms to the "canonical" checkout (=
working tree) line ending convention. For QEMU, I would think that said
convention dictates LF.

Note: I'm aware that with git, the "internal" representation for
newlines, and the "external" one, are different things. Dependent on
whether one is on Windows vs. Linux, git-checkout will produce CRLF vs.
LF in the working tree, as the "external" newline representation. What
I'm saying is that, if someone sends a base64-encoded patch, that's a
statement that their *external* newline representation matches that of
the people that they expect to apply the patch. Normally, external
representations (i.e., the local working trees' newline representations)
don't have to match each other -- but if a patch is sent with base64
Content-Transfer-Encoding, then I claim that they do.

IOW, I'd simply answer the patch in question with:

"""
Please resend the patch with one of the following options:
- use LF in your local working tree, and keep the base64 C-T-E, or
- keep CRLF in your local working tree, and send with 8bit C-T-E.
"""

As a practical result, if someone develops QEMU in a Windows
environment, they should only use 8bit C-T-E when posting patches.

Strictly my personal opinion, of course.

Thanks,
Laszlo
