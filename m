The device/object management aspect seems to handle things *mostly* okay, at
least ever since QOM child properties started being tracked by a hash table
instead of a linked list. It's worth noting that that change (b604a854) was
done to better handle IRQ pins for ARM guests with lots of CPUs. I think it=
 is
inevitable that certain machine types/configurations will call for large
numbers of objects and I think it is fair to improve things to allow for th=
is
sort of scalability.

But I agree it shouldn't be abused, and you're right that there are some
problem areas that arise. Trying to outline them:

 a) introspection commands like 'info qom-tree' become pretty unwieldly,
    and with large enough numbers of objects might even break things (QMP
    response size limits maybe?)
 b) various related lists like reset handlers, vmstate/savevm handlers might
    grow quite large

I think we could work around a) with maybe flagging certain
"internally-only" objects as 'hidden'. Introspection routines could then
filter these out, and routines like qom-set/qom-get could return report
something similar to EACCESS so they are never used/useful to management
tools.

In cases like b) we can optimize things where it makes sense like with
Scott's patch here. In most cases these lists need to be walked one way
or another, whether it's done internally by the object or through common
interfaces provided by QEMU. It's really just the O(n^2) type handling
where relying on common interfaces becomes drastically less efficient,
but I think we should avoid implementing things in that way anyway, or
improve them as needed.

That's an interesting proposition, I think it's worth exploring further,
but from a high level:

 - each SpaprDrc has migration state, and some sub-classes SpaprDrc (e.g.
   SpaprDrcPhysical) have additional migration state. These are sent
   as-needed as separate VMState entries in the migration stream.
   Moving to a single DRC means we're either sending them as an flat
   array or a sparse list, which would put just as much load on the
   migration code (at least, with Scott's changes in place). It would
   also be difficult to do all this in a way which maintains migration
   compatibility with older machine types.
 - other aspects of modeling these as QOM objects, such as look-ups,
   reset-handling, and memory allocations, wouldn't be dramatically
   improved upon by handling it all internally within the object

AFAICT the biggest issue with modeling the DRCs as individual objects
is actually how we deal with introspection, and we should try to
improve. What do you think of the alternative suggestion above of
marking certain objects as 'hidden' from various introspection
interfaces?
