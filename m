Oh, that's interesting, thanks!

I also did some build time tests on my x86 Linux laptop, but I did not
notice any significant differences there.

Now that you've mentioned softfloat ... I think that matches what I've
seen in the log output on cirrus-ci.com : Suddenly there is a lot of
verbose softloat test output there that I never noticed before.

I assume that's ok that we now compile/test more on FreeBSD, so I'll go
ahead with this patch and put it into my next "CI" pull
request to fix the cirrus-ci builds again.
