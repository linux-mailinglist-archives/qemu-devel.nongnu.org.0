Title:
  Qemu GDB Arm core registers XML description not valid for M-profile

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  When trying to debug an armv7-m binary running on Qemu, GDB makes some
  mistakes due to mistakenly believing the target is not M-profile.

  One observable is that backtraces over signal handlers are not handled
  correctly -- since the special M-profile EXC_RETURN value is not
  recognised.  That happens because GDB doesn't think the target is
  M-profile.

  This happens because GDB sees a reported feature set from the Qemu
  remote connection that includes the feature `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

  As described in the GDB online docs, for "M-profile targets (e.g. Cortex-=
M3), the =E2=80=98org.gnu.gdb.arm.core=E2=80=99 feature is replaced by =E2=
=80=98org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile=E2=80=99"
  https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/ARM-Features.html

  From a scan of the Qemu source code on commit
  ea1329bb3a8d5cd25b70e3dbf73e7ded4d5ad756 it seems that when emulating
  an arm core it uses `arm-core.xml` unconditionally for
  `CPUClass->gdb_core_xml_file`, and that means the only feature
  provided is `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core`.

  Note that even though there is a command to set the architecture in GDB, =
setting the target architecture to an M-profile core is still not a valid w=
orkaround.
  This is because the target description overrides everything in setting th=
e `is_m` attribute within GDB.

  Reproduction of the observable:
  Using the examples here https://git.linaro.org/people/peter.maydell/m-pro=
file-tests.git/tree/ .
  Build the examples, and run =

  ```
  qemu-system-arm -s -S -no-reboot -M lm3s6965evb -m 16 -serial stdio -disp=
lay none -net nic -net user,restrict=3Don -d guest_errors,unimp -kernel tes=
t3-kern.bin
  ```

  Then in a GDB session
  ```
  vshcmd: > arm-none-eabi-gdb -q                                           =
                                                                           =
                                              =

  (gdb)
  vshcmd: > file test3-kern.elf
