Why exactly it has to be deprecated?  We have use cases that
require `query-cpus-fast` to exist, but I don't see why the
existence of a command that returns extended information is a bad
thing.

Having a command that synchronizes CPU state is even a
requirement if we want to eventually implement "info registers"
using QMP.
