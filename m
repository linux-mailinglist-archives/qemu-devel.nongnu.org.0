Let's see how that works out for users.

Assume machine foobar needs a non-default firmware for "small" memory
sizes, such as -m 64.

Alice doesn't know.  She starts QEMU like this:

    $ qemu-system-foo -M foobar -m 64

It hangs early in boot.  Not good.

Except the warning from spd_data_generate() rides to her rescue!

    qemu-system-foo: warning: Memory size is too small for SDRAM type, adju=
sting type

Since Alice is rather sharp, the warning makes her realize immediately
that she needs to use different firmware, like this:

    $ qemu-system-foo -M foobar -m 64 -bios roms/foobar/firmware-small.bin

Okay, I'm done telling my fairy tale.

If you want helpful, make it work out of the box: default to the
firmware that actually works, don't make users guess which one they
need.

But one more time: this is all theoretical.  We're talking about unused,
broken code.  If you want to keep it, please add users, and fix it up.
