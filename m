There seems to be convergence on a pretty simple interface which uses
ebreak surrounded by a couple of specific no-ops:

      slli x0, x0, 0x1f
      ebreak
      srai x0, x0, 0x7

There are implementations in rust and openocd, and I've got one for
picolibc. The risc-v semihosting code is sitting on a branch in my repo
on github:

        https://github.com/keith-packard/qemu/tree/riscv-semihost

Would also be nice for multi-core setups. I'd like to start with the
simple plan for now.

Uh, we do that all the time? The mux device is designed to handle this
so that you can use stdio for both monitor commands and application
I/O. It's very convenient, the only issue is that the last device that
hooks to the mux ends up getting input first (you use ^Ac to rotate
among the selected devices).
