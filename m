I don't disagree if you really want to set user_features for
consistency.  Considering it part of expansion and not filtering
makes sense, too.

The only point I disagree with is the handling feature dependency
before the "if (cpu->max_features)" block.  e.g. if a feature is
being disabled by x86_cpu_get_supported_feature_word(), we also
need to disable features that depend on it.
