I disagree. Either iotests can handle readlink not having '-f',
in which case it should not let readlink spew junk to the log,
or it can't, in which case it should bail out.

If you want to tell the user something, you should catch the
failure and print something yourself, because then you can do
so with a message that will make sense to somebody trying to
run the test suite and point them in the direction of what
they can do to deal with the problem, eg something like
 "readlink version doesn't support '-f'. Assuming that iotests
  are being run from the build tree. If this isn't true then
  we will fail later on: you can either run from the build tree,
  or install a newer readlink."
(fix up the details to suit, or throw away entirely in favour
of some other text if you like).

Printing "readlink: illegal option" is just going to cause
people to assume QEMU's scripts are broken and send us bug
reports, so please don't do that.

thanks
