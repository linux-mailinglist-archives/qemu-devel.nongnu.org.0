I don't know too much about the options here, unfortunately. But I
wonder about security implications of all these approaches.

We have this issue with other cases such as libusb where the
library we are using is not expecting hostile input so does
not validate it fully.
This is often the case for pass-through approaches.
Do all the options here expect untrusted input?
