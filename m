I'm not adding 4Gb support here (it's out of scope of this series),
all this patch does is making pre-existing global ram_size fixup,
this board only business and naming it clamped_ram_size to match
its current usage (along with explicitly documenting the deviation from
other boards why it was requested to keep fixup 'for user convenience'
instead of going for correct and simpler error message telling
how much RAM user could specify on CLI).

Well, board was fixing up global ram_size and then used it to
 - pass clamped value to guest via register
 - pass it to load load_image_targphys()
 - perform various checks
 - affects reset sequence

This patch keeps all of that in the same state
(I'd suspect changing above points, would break guest)

If you have an alternative patch that enables to use full 4Gb,
I'd include on respin as far as it doesn't change user supplied
global ram_size && ms->ram_size && uses generic ms->ram &&
preferably on top of
 "[PATCH 44/86] hppa: use memdev for RAM"
so it would be easier to drop it if there would opposition to it
without affecting series.
