Title:
   Raspberry Pi 4 qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU
  context @ pc=3D0xffff87709b0e

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Hello,

  I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with an ESXi hypervisor installed on it (ESXi ARM=
 Edition).
  I created a CentOS 7 VM on it and I'm using a Docker container which is r=
unning qemu inside it.

  This container is a Debian Bullseye OS and I'm using qemu-i386 to start m=
y application inside it.
  The error given by qemu is the following :

  qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=3D0xffff=
9d5f9b0e
  qemu:handle_cpu_signal received signal outside vCPU context @ pc=3D0xffff=
82f29b0e

  (The pc=3D value is always different, I guess it is randomly generated).

  My qemu version is : qemu-i386 version 5.1.0 (Debian 1:5.1+dfsg-4+b1)

  Could you please help me? Why am I facing this error?

  Feel free to ask any questions regarding this matter in order to find
  a solution to it!

  Regards
