Yes.

Why?  You don't have to wait for the reply before sending the next
request.

Adding a request id to the messages might be useful, so it is possible
to wait for a reply to a specific message without having to keeping
track of all in-flight messages.

Having headers in the reply allows it to process them in generic code.
There is a size header for the reply, so you can parse the stream
without knowing what replay to expect.  You can use the status field to
indicate the payload, simliar to virtio-gpu which has response code
OK_NODATA, some OK_$whatpayload and some ERR_$failure codes.

You can dispatch based on the response/status code and run *fully*
asynchronous without too much trouble.

A properly structed reply allows a different approach in reply
processing (see above).  But that only works if it is in the protocol
right from the start.  As add-on feature it can't provide the benefits
because the reply parser must be able to handle both protocol variants.
