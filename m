 From the previous link (summary of existing class_by_name quirks):
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg615737.html

   "Deprecating unwanted stuff now is likely to make a
    later cleanup so much easier."

This was 8 months ago :/

IIUC we need to restart this topic addressing the libvirt community=20
first, then see with the QEMU one?
