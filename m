We're going to have other ways to do device assignment in the future
leveraging the coming nested device page tables just like ARM, but
it's still a long way until even the hardware is ready...  And we also
don't know whether Microsoft will be unhappy again on these new
bits. :)

So, I would consider bouncing that question to Microsoft, because we
first need to understand why Windows do not allow caching-mode to be
set..

My wild guess is that caching-mode will require some extra overhead in
guest OS IOMMU layer so Windows is currently lacking of, while they
might have some other way to do device assignment to L2 on their own
(e.g., do Microsoft allow to assign devices to L2 guest if on Hyperv
cloud)?

CCing Vitaly as the Hyperv/Windows expert in case for further input.
