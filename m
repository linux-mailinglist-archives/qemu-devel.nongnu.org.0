Ah, I looked into this more and it compares it to hardware running the
same binary. In this case there is no hardware so that doesn't work
too well.

What we could do though, is compare it to Spike (which I think has the
vector instructions?) which would have the same effect.

In this case there is no GCC with the new instructions.

That would be interesting, I'll take a look.
