On further investigation I think the use of -bios is probably
doomed. The way QEMU implements -bios is to load the firmware
as a ROM, then later when a CPU reset is triggered at the end
of machine construction, the ROM is copied into the RAM area.

For SEV we need the encrypted firmware in the RAM area, but
my patch here is applying the encryption in the ROM. QEMU
copies this encrypted code across in the CPU reset handler
but this can't work because IIUC that invalidates the
initialization vector preventing correct decryption.

We can't delay the encryption step until after the ROM
copying because by that time the SEV initialization sequence
has gone too far along.

I did a gross hack which disabled use of the ROM and ROM
copying and directly loaded the firmware into the RAM area
and that successfully ran, but it is too much of a hack to
consider proposing as a real patch.

I'm going to go back to just looking at how we can make
support for pflash-without-NVRAM a first class citizen
in QEMU firmware descriptors / libvirt, since that is
known to work without hacks.

So ignore this flawed series henceforth.

Daniel
