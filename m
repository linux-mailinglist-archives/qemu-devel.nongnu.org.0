I'm not sure it would be each DIMM separately as there are likely to only
be a couple of types.

I wonder if we care to emulate beyond 1 volatile and 1 persistent.
Sure devices might exist, but if we can exercise all the code paths
with a simpler configuration, perhaps we don't need to handle the
more complex ones?

The sticky corner here is Set Partition Info 
CXL r3.0 8.2.9.8.2.1

Separation between volatile and non volatile is configurable at runtime.

Hmm. Let me have a play.  I've not run x86 tests for a while so
perhaps something is missing there.

I'm carrying a patch to override check_last_peer() in
cxl_port_setup_targets() as that is wrong for some combinations,
but that doesn't look like it's related to what you are seeing.
