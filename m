Hi Christian,

It seems that there was an issue with the posting of these series. Threading
is inexistant. All the emails appear scattered and unsorted in my mailbox,
between 12/16 and 12/18... which is a bit painful. I'll try to find some time
to have a look anyway, but this greatly lowers the odds for these series to get
multiple reviews, which seems problematic given the ** NOTE: ** section you've
added to the cover. Please fix this.

Cheers,

--
Greg
