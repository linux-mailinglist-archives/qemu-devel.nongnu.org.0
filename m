I still find this all overkill compared to just exposing the

If there's a large amount of existing code refactoring to be avoided
an intermediate variable can be declared to point to the struct field
to avoid the field references.

The GLib automatic memory support is explicitly designed to be extendd
with support for application specific types. We already do exactly that
all over QEMU with many calls to G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC(..) to
register functions for free'ing specific types, such that you can
use 'g_autoptr' with them.

It is more important than a matter of taste - it is about having a consistent
approach throughout QEMU. That means automatic free'ing of variables should
involve g_autoptr, not something custom to a specific type with different
terminology.

I can't see the array framework being complex enough that it will be
changed in a way that invalidates existing usage.

I consider the QEMU normal practice for namespacing types/macros/functions
is to have the typename as the first component.
