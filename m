Yes, the primary concern is what behavior we should have for ARM when
QMP/HMP "nmi" command is executed. After that's determined, I can dig
into SDEI if needed.

As Alexey said in another reply, it's used to force the guest to have
crash dump or drop into in-kernel debugger (xmon) on PowerPC. However,
x86 guest will receive NMI after the command is issued. This RFC patch
is following x86 to inject "pseudo" NMIs, but it seems incorrect. So
the question is what behavior we should have for ARM when QMP/HMP "nmi"
command is issued? I'm expecting more input in this regard :)

Thanks,
Gavin
