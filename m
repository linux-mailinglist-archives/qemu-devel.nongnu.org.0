I'm surprised the lack of encryption doesn't bother you. The security
bug reporting process should be confidential to prevent disclosure of
0-days.

I think it's worth investigating whether GitLab Issues can be configured
in a secure-enough way for security bug reporting. That way HTTPS is
used and only GitLab stores the confidential information (this isn't
end-to-end encryption but seems better than unencrypted SMTP and
plaintext emails copied across machines).

Triaging and fixing are different things. Where is the bottleneck,
triaging or fixing?

Do downstream maintainers want to know about potential security bug
reports that have not been triaged yet?

Maybe there should there be a pre-announce list for bugs that have been
triaged?

That saves downstream from being spammed with confidential info
that they probably can't use.

I don't think a broadcast model works well for assigning responsibility.
If maintainers constantly receive security-related emails (most of which
don't affect them), they will ignore them. This is what happens with
broadcast CI and fuzzing results.

Instead someone should assign security bug reports to relevant maintainers.

Another option is to let reporters directly contact the maintainers
(e.g. QEMU's MAINTAINERS file), but this is hard to get right and if a
maintainer is on vacation the report may go unnoticed.

Anyway, it's unclear to me what the motivation for creating a list and
changing the process is. Please share your goals and reasoning in more
detail.
