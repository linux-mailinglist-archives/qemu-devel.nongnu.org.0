You'll need to set some sort of breakpoint on the last instruction so
gdb can inspect things before the program is unloaded. I think it's
possible to wire poweroff events to the gdbstub but I haven't looked
into that myself.

For linux-user:

  $QEMU -g 1234 $PRG

for system emulation

  $QEMU -s -S

and then on the gdb end:

  gdb $BIN -ex "target remote localhost:1234"

and then you can operate as you normally do with a gdb session. GDB has
two scripting interfaces. The command mode is basically a list of gdb
commands but might work for what you want. If you want to be a bit more
programatic you can use python. See the example in
tests/guest-debug/test-gdbstub.py
