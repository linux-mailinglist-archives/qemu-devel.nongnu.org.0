Quite a hack. The two obvious problems are:

1. We can't guarantee that we can actually revert the permissions. I
   think we ignore failure to loosen permissions meanwhile so that at
   least the &error_abort doesn't trigger, but bs could still be in the
   wrong state afterwards.

   It would be cleaner to use check+abort instead of actually setting
   the new permission.

2. As aborting the permission change makes more obvious, we're checking
   something that might not be true any more when we actually make the
   change.

Pragmatically, a hack might be good enough here, but it should be
documented as such (with a short explanation of its shortcomings) at
least.
