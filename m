Just make sure that any pipeline and mandatory CI steps don't slow things
down too much... While the examples have talked about 1 or 2 pull requests
getting done in parallel, and that's great, the problem is when you try to
land 10 or 20 all at once, one that causes the failure and you aren't sure
which one it actually is... Make sure whatever you design has sane
exception case handling to not cause too much collateral damage... I worked
one place that would back everything out if a once-a-week CI test ran and
had failures... That CI test-run took 2 days to run, so it wasn't practical
to run it often, or for every commit. In the end, though, the powers that
be implemented a automated bisection tool that made it marginally less
sucky..
