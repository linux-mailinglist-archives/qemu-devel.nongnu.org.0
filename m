Even though there's only a single CPU on sam460ex and PCIe is mostly 
unused, with this patch I could no more reproduce a problem that we had 
before with some programs crashing within guest under AmigaOS for unknown 
reason. That problem happened randomly (although I could reproduce it 
before) so I'm not sure if this fixed it or something else (more likely 
commit 235352ee6e) or will just resurface later but at least this seems to 
work so

Thanks for fixing it.

I think we needed to add locking here because it asserted otherwise but I 
don't remember the details now.
