The question is valid: if the space for the clusters is allocated but
the subclusters are not marked as such then any partial write request
will need to fill the rest with zeroes (in practice handle_alloc_space()
can do that efficiently but that's another question).

If there is a backing file then there's no other alternative because we
do need to copy the data from the backing file.

If there is no backing file perhaps we could allocate all subclusters as
well. I suppose we can detect that scenario at that point in the code (I
haven't checked) and I don't know what would happen if one later
attaches a backing file on runtime using the command-line options.

But what I would argue is that I don't see the benefit of using extended
L2 entries on an preallocated image with no backing file: other than
having twice as much L2 metadata what would be the use? The point of
subclusters is that they make allocation more efficient, but if the
image is already fully allocated then they give you nothing.
