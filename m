I do not see we need page size mask per endpoint.

While I am trying to understand what "page-size-mask" guest will work with

- 4K page size host and 4k page size guest
  config.page_size_mask = 0xffffffffffff000 will work

- 64K page size host and 64k page size guest
  config.page_size_mask = 0xfffffffffff0000 will work

- 64K page size host and 4k page size guest
   1) config.page_size_mask = 0xffffffffffff000 will also not work as
VFIO in host expect iova and size to be aligned to 64k (PAGE_SIZE in
host)
   2) config.page_size_mask = 0xfffffffffff0000 will not work, iova
initialization (in guest) expect minimum page-size supported by h/w to
be equal to 4k (PAGE_SIZE in guest)
       Should we look to relax this in iova allocation code?

Thanks
