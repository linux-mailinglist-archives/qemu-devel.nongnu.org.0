On x86, this is implemented by "host".  "max" gives you the full
set of features that can be enabled by the user.  "host" gives
you a reasonable set of features you will want to see enabled by
default when the user says "use the host CPU".

"max" isn't something we want to expose to end users.  It is
something we need to expose to other software components.

The whole point of "max" is to tell management software which
features are valid to be enabled in a host.  If "+x-my-feature"
works, "x-my-feature" must be included in "max".
