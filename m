Does that mean you'll reply later with more detail or this is all you had 
to say about this? (Just to know if I should wait for another reply.)

It was used by sam460ex until moving ram allocation to memdev broke it.

I don't agree with that. It's already hard enough for non-expert users to 
figure out the needed command line switches, making that even harder by 
throwing back an error for everything that could work just not exactly 
specified is needlessly annoying them further. To the point of chasing 
them away from using QEMU. A lot of people prefer VMWare or VirtualBox for 
this reason and only try QEMU if there's no other way.
