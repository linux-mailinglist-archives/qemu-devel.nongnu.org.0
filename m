Yep, the bulk of dbus policy restrictions are tied to user/groups.
After all, if two processes are under the same user ID, in general
any restrictions dbus tried to place on them are worthless as they
can simply attack each other outside dbus.

Running helpers as different UID from QEMU itself makes sense.

Running every single helper as a distinct UID is likely unmanagably
complex - especially if the helpers need certain privileges to
do their job.

SELinux gives us more fine grained control.

For example, consider each vhost user helper process

   "virtiofs_t"=20

and QEMU is "svirt_t"

You can write a rule which says  svirt_t can send messages
to virtiofs_t, which allows QEMU to talk to the helpers.

Two helper processes both running "virtiofs_t" will, however,
not be able to talk to each other.
