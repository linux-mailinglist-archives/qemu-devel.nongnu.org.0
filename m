"bitmaps size: 0" is better. Will fix the description above.

If we ever add support for copying internal snapshots, that would not be 
included either.  Maybe "copying just allocated guest-visible contents" 
for @required, and no change to the wording for @fully-allocated.

Could do.  Sounds like I'm better off submitting a v5 for this patch, 
although I'll go ahead and stage 1-6 for pull request today to minimize 
future rebase churn.

During creation (including when parsing QMP from the user over the 
monitor), everything is indeed guaranteed to be zero-initialized.  But 
we don't have any requirement that things remain zero-initialized even 
when has_FOO is false; at the same time, it's easy enough to make this 
code conditional.

I'll see how easy or hard it is for my v5 patch.

Here, the object is going to be subsequently freed; I'm less worried 
about wasting time doing local cleanups than I am about the earlier case 
about letting an object escape immediate scope in a different state than 
the usual preconditions.
