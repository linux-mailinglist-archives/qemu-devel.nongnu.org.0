The following link will always reflect the published artifacts from
the most recently fully successful CI pipeline, on the 'qemu-bits'
branch, and 'qemu-bits-build' CI job:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/biosbits-bits/-/jobs/artifacts/qemu-bits/download?job=qemu-bits-build

Tweak as needed if you push the CI to master branch instead. This
link can be considered the permanent home of the artifact. I'd just
suggest that the QEMU job automatically skip if it fails to download
the artifact, as occassionally transient infra errors can impact
it.

With regards,
Daniel
