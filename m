I find (3) and (4) good enough reasons to use deprecation.

(1) for configs that started without -numa &&|| without -smp dies>1,
      QEMU can do just that (enable auto_enable_numa).

(2) As for configs that are out of spec, I do not care much (junk in - junk=
 out)
(though not having to spend time on bug reports and debug issues, just to s=
ay
it's not supported in the end, makes deprecation sound like a reasonable
choice)

(3) However if config matches bare metal i.e. CPU has more than 1 die and w=
ithin
dies limits (spec wise), QEMU has to produce valid CPUs.
In this case QEMU can't make up multiple numa nodes and mappings of RAM/CPU=
s
on user's behalf. That's where we have to error out and ask for explicit
numa configuration.

For such configs, current code (since 5.0), will produce in the best case
performance issues  due to mismatching data in APICID, CPUID and ACPI table=
s,
in the worst case issues might be related to invalid APIC ID if running on =
EPYC host
and HW takes in account subfields of APIC ID (according to Babu real CPU us=
es
die_id(aka node_id) internally).
I'd rather error out on nonsense configs earlier than debug such issues
and than error out anyways later (upsetting more users).

(4)
If I were non hobby user, I'd hate if QEMU allowed me to start invalid conf=
ig,
that I'd have to spend time on debugging issues (including performance ones=
),
instead of clearly telling me what's wrong and how config should be correct=
ed.
I'd probably jump to another hypervisor that does the job right,
instead of digging into QEMU codebase and CPU specs to figure out how
to hack and configure it.
