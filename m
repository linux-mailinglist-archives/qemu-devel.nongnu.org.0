I would agree with this and would also suggest that things tested
in 'make check' should ideally be reducing work for the maintainer:
if something fails 'make check' then that change won't get into
the tree and the task of getting it to work is pushed back to the
original patch submitter. If something causes failures but they're
not caught by 'make check' then the patch will get into the tree and
now it's likely the subsystem maintainer's job to track down and
fix the bug after the fact.

FWIW I haven't seen that iotest 130 failure again...
