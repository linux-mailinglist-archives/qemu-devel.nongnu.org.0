I'll be honest: I don't think I understand the main purpose of
QOM parent/child relationships.  My best guess is that they make
object destruction easier to manage (if you destroy a parent, you
will automatically destroy its children).

If we don't write down what QOM parent/child relationships are
supposed to mean (and what they are _not_ supposed to mean), we
will never know when it's appropriate and/or safe to move objects
to a different parent.
