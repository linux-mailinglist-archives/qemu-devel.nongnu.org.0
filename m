This is all fine when run from libvirt (and I do understand that QSD
is all about that, not necessarily a standalone general purpose
server), but also that's a massive hassle for anyone else trying to
use QSD.  I'm not confident I could correctly formulate the set of QMP
commands that would be needed to make this work, even with the
documentation and full source code.

Also this moves the problem to "when is the chardev socket ready",
especially when not using chardev over stdio.
