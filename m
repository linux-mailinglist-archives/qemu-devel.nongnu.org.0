Grr.  If someone can decide this, they can bloody well document it
somewhere.

The *guest* is a PAPR platform, there's no guarantee the host has to
be a PAPR platform (in fact it usually won't be, it's just that
powernv has a lot of the same device tree properties).

Not if you're using PR on, say, an embedded ppc or an old Apple
machine that doesn't have the PAPR-ish properties in the host device
tree.

Uh.. it doesn't though, it omits it entirely.

Also I don't really understand how it's relevant to a KVM guest in the
first place.
