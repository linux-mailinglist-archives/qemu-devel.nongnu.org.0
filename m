Well, I would say it is in raw=E2=80=99s storage child, because the defin=
ition
of backing chain allocation only recurses down the COW link.

If it is *anywhere* in the storage subtree, it is to be considered
allocated on this level.  If it is in the backing COW subtree, it is not.=


And if it is in neither, it doesn=E2=80=99t matter whether we say it=E2=80=
=99s allocated
or not:

For example (1), for sparse files, the raw driver may not have the data
in the storage subtree.  But it sure as hell won=E2=80=99t have it in its=

backing COW subtree, because it doesn=E2=80=99t have one.  So for simplic=
ity=E2=80=99s
sake, it may just return everything as allocated.

For example (2), for sparse qcow2 files, the qcow2 driver may report
some ranges as unallocated even when it doesn=E2=80=99t have a backing fi=
le.  We
don=E2=80=99t need to change it to report such cases as allocated.
