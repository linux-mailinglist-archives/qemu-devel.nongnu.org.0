Anyone with a fork to rebase continuosly is in an unenviable position.
Rebasing will never be painless, and the only way to win the game is to
stop playing it, ideally by getting your stuff merged upstream.

I think this is related to hobbyist vs. corporation only insofar a
well-heeled corporation can fund folly for much longer than a hobbyist.

That said, helping forks bear the rebase pain while they work towards a
merge is certainly a laudable goal.

Yes, release notes for developers would be nice.
