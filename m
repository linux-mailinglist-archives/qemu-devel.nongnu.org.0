As discussed here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg00697.html

and here:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-10/msg01388.html

it would be good to have some more valuable iotests enabled in the
"auto" group to get better iotest coverage during "make check".

And once Max' "iotests: Add and use $SOCK_DIR" patch series has been
merged, we can indeed enable these Python-based tests, too.

There is just one small downside: Since these tests require a QEMU
that features a 'virtio-blk' device, we cannot run the iotests
with binaries like qemu-system-tricore anymore. But since the iotests
were not very useful with such binaries anyway, I think it's ok now
if we skip them there.

I've also added a patch that removes test 130 from the "auto" group
instead. Test 130 has been reported to fail intermittently, so we
should not use it in "make check" block until it is fixed.

Based-on: 20191010152457.17713-1-mreitz@redhat.com

v3:
 - Test 183 fails on Patchew, so I removed it from the "auto" group
   again

v2:
 - Checked the iotests with NetBSD, too (now that Eduardo has
   re-activated Gerd's patches for creating NetBSD VM images)
 - Use 'openbsd' instead of 'openbsd6'
 - Use 'grep -q' instead of 'grep' for grep'ing silently
 - Added the patch to disable 130 from the "auto" group

John Snow (1):
  iotests: remove 'linux' from default supported platforms

Thomas Huth (5):
  iotests: Test 041 only works on certain systems
  iotests: Test 183 does not work on macOS and OpenBSD
  iotests: Skip "make check-block" if QEMU does not support virtio-blk
  iotests: Enable more tests in the 'auto' group to improve test
    coverage
  iotests: Remove 130 from the "auto" group
