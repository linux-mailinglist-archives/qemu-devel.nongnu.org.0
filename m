Does that work with CPU hotplug ? ie cold boot with -smp 4,maxcpus=8
and some time later try to enable the extra 4 cpus at runtime ?

Libvirt would not be particularly happy with allowing (b) because it
enables the 3rd parties to change the VM state behind libvirt's back
in ways that can ultimately confuse its understanding of the state
of the VM. If there's some task that needs  interaction with a QEMU
managed by libvirt, we need to expose suitable APIs in libvirt (if
they don't already exist).
