yes, but also only on tmpfs. ext4, xfs, ZFS all work fine.. the numbers=20
for tmpfs vary between runs, each wrong count is sometimes 393216 (256k=20
expected + 128k extra), sometimes 458752 (+192k). it's always the dirty=20
bitmap used by the mirror job which is 'wrong', not the passed-in sync=20
bitmap which verifies correctly. the final mirror results also seem=20
correct.

for the first diff hunk (bitmap + never + simulated), we did

- reference mirror #0
- add sync bitmap 'bitmap0'
- do writes to dirty 6 sectors (393216)
- reference mirror #1
- test mirror #1
- bitmap0 still has count 393216
- reference mirror #2
- test mirror #2
-- while that is not yet completed, do 4 more writes
-- bitmap0 now has count 393216 + 262144 655360
-- dirty bitmap 'should have' count 262144, but has 458752 or 393216

this is not what actually interests us at this point: how far the mirror=20
has progressed does not matter, we just want to see that the writes we=20
did while it was ongoing have been reflected in the sync bitmap. so=20
unless there is some hunch that this difference in mirroring 'speed'=20
between the file systems is something that we need to take a look at,=20
I'd say we just dump bitmap0 after the writes have been performed,=20
instead of all bitmaps (in line 230f).
