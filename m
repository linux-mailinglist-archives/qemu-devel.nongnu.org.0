This is a v2 to =E2=80=9Cblock: Add BDS.never_freeze=E2=80=9D.

It depends on my =E2=80=9Cblock: Delay poll when ending drained sections=E2=
=80=9D
series:

Depends-on: <20190619152603.5937-1-mreitz@redhat.com>


It turned out that if you run 030 (or just the new test_overlapping_5
case) sufficiently often, it breaks; which is why I=E2=80=99m hesitant to=
 just
merge the =E2=80=9Cadd never_freeze=E2=80=9D series as it is.

There are several reasons for why this test case breaks, I hope patches
3 to 6 fix them.  Patch 12 adds a test that is much more reliable than
test_overlapping_5 at detecting the problems fixed by at least patches 4
to 6.  (I think that 3 doesn=E2=80=99t really need a test.)

I=E2=80=99m sure there are other ways to see these problems, but well, co=
ming
from 030, concurrent commit/stream jobs are how I reproduced them.
Hence the same of this series.

Patch 2 is for something I encountered on the way.  Patch 11 tests it.


v2:
- Added a bunch of more patches.
