Ping.

If I understand the situation correctly, the current consensus is:

* use VM name for PA server connection
* audiodev id is a good default for PA stream name

What is not clear whether we need a separate qapi option for stream 
name, or just always use the audiodev id.  I don't use pulseaudio or 
libvirt, so I can't really comment about this issue.

Ideally I'd like to create a new patch with this change and a fix for 
the coverity issue reported in [1].

Zoltan
