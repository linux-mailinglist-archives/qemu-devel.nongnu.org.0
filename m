Hmm, that probably explains some of my failures as well.  It is not=20
obvious what has to be done to a system prior to being able to even run=20
'./check -nfs'; and it would be nice if ./check could give better=20
heads-up warnings about an insufficient setup.

You may indeed have a point that the test may work with other non-local=20
setups.  But with this a quick hack:

diff --git i/tests/qemu-iotests/173 w/tests/qemu-iotests/173

./check -qcow2 -nbd 173   # fails:

there may be more I can do to let this test work with nbd as well, but=20
for the sake of getting this email sent, that's as far as I've gotten=20
for now.
