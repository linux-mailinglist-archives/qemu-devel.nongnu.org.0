The reason that the capability to run in PV mode is expressed in the CPU
model is that this capability *is* provided by the CPU in terms of
available instructions. I wouldn't see a benefit in providing
a meta-property that needs to be synced with the CPU model.

So, if something has to be concluded from the fact that a VM
could run in PV mode, that decision should be derived from the
CPU model.
