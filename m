Right, but the weird bit here is that IIUC, the kernel during general
probe is switching the indicator from off -> blinking -> off without it
ever going to "on" state.  And it seems to do the power on and presence
check with the indicator still in blinking state.  This is different
from the normal sequence on a hotplug:
=09press button
=09indicator goes to blinking
=09...wait...
=09indicator goes to full on
=09slot powers on
=09presence detect

Or am I missing something?

I don't think there's an unambiguous correct answer here.  But I think
it's reasonable to interpret a general "device_add" as "instruct the
virtual operator to plug in the card ASAP" as easily as "shove the
virtual card in right now".  device_add already covers a bunch of
different pluggable interfaces, so I don't think precisely aligning to
pci-e semantics is really a priority.

I don't think I was clear.  There are two separate and unrelated things
I'm bringing up here.  The first is that having the device_add fail for
transitory reasons that the management layer doesn't really care about
is really bad UX.

But the second point I'm raising here is that "don't plug when blinking"
is not, strictly speaking an implementable strategy for a human
operator.  That makes me conclude that the idea here is plugs started
at basically the same time as the blinking starts (which could be a
little before or a little after, humans being fuzzy) should actually be
acceptable, even if they finish after the indicator is blinking.  It's
not clear to me that the kernel's current behaviour actually permits
that.

Oh, no, that's not what I'm suggesting.  Adding an "is allowed" command
is even worse.  It makes the management's task *more* complex, which
making any possible race here even wider.
