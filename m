There is no information about host hardware, so I'd onldy hazard a guess
that host is non NUMA machine so all guest RAM and CPUs are in the same
latency domain, so that's why you are seeing pretty much the same timings.

QEMU nor KMV do not simullate HW latencies at all, all that is configured
with '-numa hmat-lb' is intended for guest OS consumption as a hint for
smarter memory allocation and it's on to user to pin CPUs and RAM to
concrete host NUMA nodes and use  host's values in '-numa hmat-lb' to
actually get performance benefits from it on 'NUMA' machine.
On non NUMA host it's rather pointless except of the cases where one
needs to fake NUMA config (like testing some aspects of NUMA related code
in guest OS).

Title:
  Configured Memory access latency and bandwidth not taking effect

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I was trying to configure latencies and bandwidths between nodes in a
  NUMA emulation using QEMU 5.0.0.

  Host : Ubuntu 20.04 64 bit
  Guest : Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit

  The machine configured has 2 nodes. Each node has 2 CPUs and has been
  allocated 3GB of memory. The memory access latencies and bandwidths
  for a local access (i.e from initiator 0 to target 0, and from
  initiator 1 to target 1) are set as 40ns and 10GB/s respectively. The
  memory access latencies and bandwidths for a remote access (i.e from
  initiator 1 to target 0, and from initiator 0 to target 1) are set as
  80ns and 5GB/s respectively.

  The command line launch is as follows.

  sudo x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64  \
  -machine hmat=3Don \
  -boot c \
  -enable-kvm \
  -m 6G,slots=3D2,maxmem=3D7G \
  -object memory-backend-ram,size=3D3G,id=3Dm0 \
  -object memory-backend-ram,size=3D3G,id=3Dm1 \
  -numa node,nodeid=3D0,memdev=3Dm0 \
  -numa node,nodeid=3D1,memdev=3Dm1 \
  -smp 4,sockets=3D4,maxcpus=3D4  \
  -numa cpu,node-id=3D0,socket-id=3D0 \
  -numa cpu,node-id=3D0,socket-id=3D1 \
  -numa cpu,node-id=3D1,socket-id=3D2 \
  -numa cpu,node-id=3D1,socket-id=3D3 \
  -numa dist,src=3D0,dst=3D1,val=3D20 \
  -net nic \
  -net user \
  -hda testing.img \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D0,target=3D0,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-latency,latency=3D40 \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D0,target=3D0,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-bandwidth,bandwidth=3D10G \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D0,target=3D1,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-latency,latency=3D80 \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D0,target=3D1,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-bandwidth,bandwidth=3D5G \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D1,target=3D0,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-latency,latency=3D80 \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D1,target=3D0,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-bandwidth,bandwidth=3D5G \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D1,target=3D1,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-latency,latency=3D40 \
  -numa hmat-lb,initiator=3D1,target=3D1,hierarchy=3Dmemory,data-type=3Dacc=
ess-bandwidth,bandwidth=3D10G \

  Then the latencies and bandwidths between the nodes were tested using
  the Intel Memory Latency Checker v3.9
  (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intelr-
  memory-latency-checker.html). But the obtained results did not match
  the configuration. The following are the results obtained.

  Latency_matrix with idle latencies (in ns)

  Numa Node
  . .0. . .1.
  0 36.2 36.4
  1 34.9 35.4

  Bandwidth_matrix with memory bandwidths (in MB/s)

  Numa Node
  . . .0. . . .1. =

  0 15167.1 15308.9
  1 15226.0 15234.0

  A test was also conducted with the tool =E2=80=9Clat_mem_rd=E2=80=9D from=
 lmbench to
  measure the memory read latencies. This also gave results which did
  not match the config.

  Any information on why the config latency and bandwidth values are not
  applied, would be appreciated.
