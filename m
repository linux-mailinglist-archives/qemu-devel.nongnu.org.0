Ok, I went through the kernel code and checked which error may be
returned in which case (hope I caught all of them). Here's what I
currently have:

 vfio-ccw operation details
 --------------------------
 
Unless we interpret "device in wrong state" as "not operational",
mapping -EIO to cc 3 is probably not the right thing to do; but
generating a unit exception probably isn't either. Honestly, I'm unsure
what the right thing to do here would be...

Another problem is that -EIO might signal "something went wrong in the
kernel code" - should not happen, but would certainly not be the
caller's fault, and they can't do anything about it. That "internal
error" thing might also be signaled by -EINVAL (which is odd), but
-EINVAL could also mean "the ccw chain is too long", for which
-EOPNOTSUPP would probably be a better return code, as it's a
limitation in the code, not the architecture, IIRC. Not sure if we can
still change that, though (and QEMU handles both in the same way,
anyway.)

The other return codes look sane, and the return codes for the async
region also seem sane (but have the same issue with -EIO == "device in
wrong state").

Looking at the QEMU handling, I think the -EIO handling is a bit
questionable (without an obvious solution), while mapping -EBUSY to cc
2 is the only reasonable thing to do given that the interface does not
differentiate between "busy" and "status pending". The rest seems sane.
