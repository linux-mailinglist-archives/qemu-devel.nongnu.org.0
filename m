As mentioned by Philippe already, there seems to be a problem in current 
meson which triggers a rebuild of the whole tree in some cases. See this 
thread here:

I've added a "du -sh" in one of the jobs and the size of the directory was 
indeed 2 GB already. But I did not see any problems due to that size. So 
either the limit must be bigger, or it's about the compressed size. Either 
way, it's working at least right now.

We could maybe also simply exclude the .git directory of the source 
checkout, I think that's the biggest chunk there and likely not needed for 
the tests.

Interesting idea! I'll give it a try, and if it works, I'll send a patch for 
that instead.
