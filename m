Well, if you are really ready to start from scratch, I might offer the XL s=
yntax
as a starting point for a discussion of a user-visible syntax that is also
applicable for text-based or binary API exchanges.

I=E2=80=99m going to talk about it at FOSDEM in the =E2=80=9Cminimalist lan=
guages=E2=80=9D design.
Those who are in Brussels might want to attend to get a better feel.
Source code is here: https://github.com/c3d/xl, but the only part you
care about for this discussion is src/{parser,scanner}.{c,h} and the
syntax configuration file src/xl.syntax. As well as renderer styles
src/xl.stylesheet, src/html.stylesheet, etc.

Key points for the use case considered:
- Tiny (~2000 lines of code for parser/scanner, a C and a C++ implementatio=
n)
- Fully introspectable, serializable in a cross-platform way, printable (wi=
th styles)
- Character-precise position tracking for error printing
- Parser preserves comments (for documentation generators)
- Small, if slow, interpreter in about 20K lines of code (~bash speed on so=
me tests)
  meaning we would get a =E2=80=9Cqemu scripting language=E2=80=9D with loo=
ps, tests, arithmetic, etc.

More detailed discussion at end of this mail if you think it warrants a sec=
ond look.
In any case, if it helps, I=E2=80=99d be happy to help connecting it to qem=
u=E2=80=A6

>=20

Here, that would be A.B.C, which parses as
(infix.
 (infix.
  A
  B)
 C
)

(result of `xl -nobuiltins -parse test.xl -style debug -show`)

Also, an example given earlier:

 { 'command': 'iothread-set-poll-params',
   'data': {
       'id': 'str',
=09'*max-ns': 'uint64',
=09'*grow': 'uint64',
=09'*shrink': 'uint64'
   },
   'map-to-qom-set': 'IOThread'
 }

could be written as:

command iothread_set_poll_params
=09data
=09=09id : str
=09=09*max_ns : uint64
=09=09*grow : uint64
=09=09*shrink : uint64
=09map_to_qom_set IOThread

But if you want to keep the original syntax, it seems to parse and render p=
ractically OK:

% cat /tmp/a.xl=20
{ 'command': 'iothread-set-poll-params',
   'data': {
       'id': 'str',
        '*max-ns': 'uint64',
        '*grow': 'uint64',
        '*shrink': 'uint64'
   },
   'map-to-qom-set': 'IOThread'
 }

%xl -nobuiltins -parse /tmp/a.xl  -show           =20
{ 'command':'iothread-set-poll-params', 'data': { 'id':'str',=20
    '*max-ns':'uint64', '*grow':'uint64', '*shrink':'uint64'
}, 'map-to-qom-set':'IOThread' }

This is with no change to the XL parser / scanner code
whatsoever, not even to the syntax file. So that gives me hope
that we could have a =E2=80=9Creasonably good=E2=80=9D compatibility mode
that transforms the quasi-JSON format into the new form,
with a single parser accepting both.

The XL proposal here would be to have a single format shared by
- The source definitions used to generate C code
- The monitor / internal shell syntax
- The command-line syntax
- The API data (possibly in serialized form for compactness)

More info below.

Here are some aspects that I think are interesting about it:

- Tiny (2000 lines of code for scanner and parser, ~20K for a full interpre=
ter)
C:  wc parser.c parser.h scanner.c scanner.h=20
     716    2183   26702 parser.c

     166     687    5958 ../include/parser.h
    2025    6564   68106 total

- Simple (parse tree with 8 node types, integer, real, name/symbol, text, i=
nfix, prefix, postfix and block)

=09+ integer, e.g. 12, 1_000_000 or 16#33A or 2#10101
=09+ real, e.g. 11.3, 16#1.FFF#e-3, 2#1.01
=09+ text, e.g. =E2=80=9CABC=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=98ABC=E2=80=99, <<Long text, =
multi-lines>> (configurable separators)
=09+ name/symbols, a.g. Foo_Bar, +, <=3D, (precedence and spelling configur=
able)

=09+ infix, e.g. A+B, A and B
=09+ prefix, e.g. +3, sin X
=09+ postfix, e.g. 3%, 3 km
=09+ block, e.g. [A], (A), {A} and indentation blocks

- Fully introspectable (mostly because the parse tree is simple)
- Reversible, i.e. can be printed, including with formatting, e.g.:
=09% xl -nobuiltins -parse demo/1-hello.xl -show
=09tell "localhost=E2=80=9D,=20
=09    print "Hello World=E2=80=9D
=09% xl -nobuiltins -parse demo/1-hello.xl -style debug -show  =20
=09(prefix
=09 tell
=09 (infix,
=09  =E2=80=9Clocalhost"
=09  (block indent
=09   (prefix
=09    print
=09    "Hello World=E2=80=9D
=09   ))))
- Also has a binary serializer that produces a platform-independent format
- Has multiple implementations, notably C and C++ implementation (and even =
one in XL :-)
- Validated on thousands of lines of input, with various language styles (e=
.g. Ada-like or functional)
- Character-level position tracking for error messages in scripts / config =
files:
=09/tmp/xl.xl:1007:8: Mismatched identation, expected =E2=80=9C)"
=09/tmp/xl.xl:2409:23: Mismatched identation, expected ""
- Designed to be easy to read and write
- Powerful enough to parse itself (https://github.com/c3d/xl/blob/master/xl=
2/native/xl.parser.xl)
- Dynamically configurable syntax (spelling and precedence of operators)
- Multi-line text with configurable separators, e.g. the following can be m=
ade a text constant by having XML and END_XML as text separators:
     XML
         <stuff>
            Insert your XML here
        </stuff>=20
    END_XML
- Based-numbers in any base, e.g. 8#777, 16#FFFF_FFFF and 2#1.001 as valid =
numbers
- Has essentially a single contributor (me), so easy to relicense as needed
- There is an interpreter, e.g. potential evaluate expressions like 2+3*A
- Relatively fast (6.1s to parse 1M lines of code representing 40M of code,=
 cpp ~1s)
% wc /tmp/tmp.xl
 1000000 3893922 41679700 /tmp/tmp.xl
% time xl -parse /tmp/tmp.xl
 6.10s user 0.21s system 99% cpu 6.346 total
- Support multiple styles, e.g. using { } for blocks or indentation, parent=
heses or not, etc.

Cons (but I=E2=80=99m not the better person to come up with cons on this pe=
t project of mine ;-):
- Idiosyncratic
- Single contributor
- Not well maintained
- Definitely not production quality (even the makefiles are broken ;-)
- Has some CI testing, but it fails, and it=E2=80=99s totally insufficient
- Interpreter far from perfect
- Designed with another purpose in mind (a programming language)
- Syntax is not C-centric, e.g. 16#FFFF instead of 0xFFFF.
- Name syntax does not allow -, i.e. max-ns is =E2=80=9Cmax minus ns=E2=80=
=9D, max_ns OK.
- [insert probably about a thousand others here]

Precedences and other stuff can be configured dynamically, through a file
in the current implementations, eg. https://github.com/c3d/xl-c/blob/master=
/xl.syntax.
So that means we can have a =E2=80=9Cnice=E2=80=9D syntax for the commands =
and objects,
and a format that can serve both as a config file format, as a command
language, and as a full shell-style language with if, loops, etc.

It also supports nested syntaxes, i.e. dynamic changes of precedence
between selected separators. Used to support simplified C syntax
with =E2=80=9Cextern int foo();=E2=80=9D, where the =E2=80=9CC=E2=80=9D syn=
tax is active between =E2=80=9Cextern=E2=80=9D
and =E2=80=9C;=E2=80=9D. Could be useful for compatibility.

Parse tree is simple enough that it=E2=80=99s fully introspectable.

There is a (configurable) renderer, so you can generate source from the
internal data structure. The renderer can generate colorized source
code in HTML, so I guess we could generate C data structures relatively
easily.

I believe that it is relatively trivial to configure the parser syntax file=
=20
to accept the QEMU quasi-JSON. (some code changes required to teach
it to totally ignore whitespace, toi avoid error messages).

More complete documentation about the language is here:
https://c3d.github.io/xl, but it=E2=80=99s quite light on implementation de=
tails.
So read only if you have a bit of time.
