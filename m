I am unsure that this is so easy. We need to be protected from other
operations
coming through QMP interface. Right now parallel operations are not allowed.

OK. Let us assume that you have added QMP savevm as proposed. It is
sync now. Sooner or later (I hope sooner) we will have to re-implement
this command with async version of the command, which will bring
again event etc and thus you will have to add compat layers to the
libvirt.

I think that it would be cleaner to start with the interface suitable for
further (coming) features and not copy obsolete implementation.
Yes, unfortunately, this is much more complex :(
