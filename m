It's not mandatory for U-Boot SPL to have stable DRAM calibration settings
from the start itself. The initial U-Boot SPL support for most
platforms (accross
architectures) usually include basic working DRAM calibration settings which
is later on updated with separate patches. Also, we don't need all U-Boot
drivers to be upstreamed in one-go as this can be done in phases.

The advantage we have with PolarFire SoC Icicle board is that we already
have a U-Boot S-mode. and we believe the OpenSBI generic platform will
work fine for PolarFire SoC Icicle board so the only thing missing right now
is the U-Boot SPL support for OpenSource boot-flow.

It will certainly accelerate open-source development if we have boot-flow
U-Boot_SPL => OpenSBI (FW_DYNAMIC) => U-Boot_S-mode working
on PolarFire SoC Icicle board. Initially, we just need DRAM, SD/eMMC,
and Serial port support for U-Boot SPL and U-Boot S-mode. Later on,
more patches can add ethernet and other booting device drivers to U-Boot.

Regarding security services of HSS, we are working on a OpenSBI
feature which will allow HSS security services to run as independent
binary in M-mode (not linked to OpenSBI) and OpenSBI FW_DYNAMIC
will be a separate binary acting as a secure monitor.
