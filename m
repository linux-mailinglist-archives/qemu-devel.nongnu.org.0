I gather that their systems are one of earlier versions of Ubuntu 16.04
that has SDL 1.2, and not SDL 2.

Let me explain the situation in more details. The build and test beds in
many organization are often maintained in a state that is not subject to
change over time. This means no updates/upgrades, except some
really rare exceptions. The rationale is that build and test beds should
be "constant" in time to achieve reproducible build runs and test
executions. In some organizations such setup is frequently achieved
by using virtual machines that automatically revert to their initial state
on each reboot.

But I digress. Let me quote our Linux deprecation policy for reference
for future readers here:

"For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases, the project will
aim to support all versions that are not end of life by their respective
vendors. For the purposes of identifying supported software versions,
the project will look at Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE distros. Other
short-lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar software versions.

For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim to
support the most recent major version at all times. Support for the
previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new major
version is released. For the purposes of identifying supported software
versions, the project will look at RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu LTS, and
SLES distros. Other long-lifetime distros will be assumed to ship
similar software versions."

However, any distribution is a "living creature". Packages are constantly
added and modified, and Ubuntu 16.04 looks different at its inception
and now, even though it bears the same version number, 16.04.

The problem here (not directly visible from the policy) is that it looks
as if we implicitly assume that any end user is constantly updating and
upgrading their systems - and that may not be true. I think we can't say
to such user: "Why didn't you update your Ubuntu 16.04?" It is up to the
user how he/she wants to use their OS, we can't and shouldn't dictate
that - at least this is my understanding of our desired relations to the
end users.

I think there seems to be a hidden unclarity in our deprecation policy,
related to the situation I described above.

I appreciate your response very much!
