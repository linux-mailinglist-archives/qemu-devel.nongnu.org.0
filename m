I broadly agree with the points about why Rust is desirable as
a language for QEMU.

I guess this dovetails into our view of security bug classification.
Stuff that affects virtualization use cases is security critical,
while stuff that affects emulation is NOT security critical.

With this in mind, it is not a priority to convert the whole of
QEMU to Rust. The priority is the subset that affects virtualization
use cases. It is a much more tractable problem if we're looking at
creating rust based vhost-user / vfio-user, only for the devices
that are commonly used for KVM with modern OS, and ignore the many
100's of devices that are only there for emulation or foir legacy OS.

Yes, but I think we'll need put in significant effort to guide / assist
people in taking this direction, and think about what it means for the
future of QEMU as a brand and GIT repo.

In many ways it is a good thing if the Rust vhost-user impls are
all in their own standalone git repos. They're likely to be independent
codebases, so there's little compelling reason to force them into the
QEMU git, where they'll have to use QEMU workflow, and QEMU release
cycle. They're better off free from QEMU where they can choose to adopt
modern development practices like GitLab merge requests if they
desire and release on a more frequent cycle than QEMU's 3-times a
year, etc. Would also make them more appealing for use by alternative
non-QEMU userspaces for KVM.

The downside is that QEMU git would only contain the "legacy" builtin
C impls of the devices, and all the "recommended" modern Rust impls
would be elsewhere. Essentially QEMU would no longer be a self-contained
provider of the complete solution. Many parts would be disaggregated,
and users now have the burden of finding all the right pieces to build
the best solution. We've already seen this to some extent with existing
vhost-user impls, but it feels like we'd be pushing towards that as a
more general model for the future which would amplify problems we've
largely been able to ignore upto now.

I'm not sure what a good answer here is. Perhaps QEMU could try to
become more of brand for an umbrella project that covers multiple
independant repos ? eg create new repos under gitlab.com/qemu-project/
but allow them to work fairly independantly from the main qemu.git ?
That way we can more easily promote a collection of QEMU repos as
showing the recommended architecture, without forcing everything
into qemu.git. We can leverage the QEMU website, wiki and documentation
in general to showcase the overall solution, while still letting the
pieces develop independently.
