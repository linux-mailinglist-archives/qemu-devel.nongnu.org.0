Yes, Balloon does not work for SEV as well. I did not investigated in
the great detail on what it will take to make it work. At that time the
main issue was that the balloon virtio device did not had
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM flag set. So, we were failing to create a
shared virtio ring. The current SEV does not have integrity protection
support so we should be okay to release the buffer from guest and import
the buffer into the guest. We probably need to deal with some cache
flushes because cache may still contain the data with different C-bit
etc. AMD has recently published the SNP architecture, which supports the
integrity protection and it appears that this architecture provides some
instruction which guest can used by the guest to validate and invalidate
the pages as it leaves and enter the guest memory space. Overall, i
think its doable but devil in the detail.
