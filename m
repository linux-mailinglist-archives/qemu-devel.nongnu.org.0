For hardware that's not necessarily the best choice. As cited in my
previous reply it has been shown to introduce vulnerabilities since
malicious devices can DMA during boot, before the OS takes control of the
IOMMU. The Arm SMMU allows an implementation to adopt a deny policy by
default.

Ideally we should aim at supporting the device in both the BIOS and the
OS. Failing that, there should at least be a way to instantiate a
virtio-iommu device that is blocking by default, that cannot be bypassed
unless the controlling software decides to allow it. Could the bypass
policy be a command-line option to the virtio-iommu device?

At the moment that per-device behavior can be emulated by sending an
ATTACH request followed by identity MAP. It could be a little more
efficient to add a "bypass" flag to the ATTACH request and avoid setting
up the identity mapping manually, since the device then wouldn't need to
look up the mapping on translation, but I don't know how much it would
improve performance. The device could also cache the fact that the address
space is identity-mapped, for the same result. The domain lookup has to
happen in any case, so you can never get the full iommu-free performance
with these mechanisms.

Thanks,
Jean
