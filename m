To be clear, I'm not objecting to warning - just that the proposed warning
doesn't give any useful information about what is considered to be a
sensible alternative size, and nor does the commit message.

Just like to see the commit message provide the background info above,
and ideally have the warning message at least give the user a suggestion
that is in the sensible order of magnitude they should be looking at.

eg tell them to aim for 1 MB (or whatever value) as a starting point to
tuning.

Daniel
