The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  GTK display refresh rate is throttled

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Guest OS running with GL enabled GTK display shows a reduced refresh
  rate, e.g. moving cursor around with iGVT-g DMA Buf.

  Apparently, a default refresh interval GUI_REFRESH_INTERVAL_DEFAULT
  (30ms) is defined in include/ui/console.h, throttling the display
  refresh rate at 33Hz.

  To correct this throttle issue, a shorter interval (16 or 17
  milliseconds) should be applied to display change listener or the
  default value should be modified.
