You probably didn't apply the 'block-crypto: misc refactoring' patch,=20
or I forgot to send it.
All that patch does is to rename block_crypto_write_func to block_crypto_cr=
eate_write_func
and same (for consistency) for block_crypto_init_func -> block_crypto_creat=
e_init_func

And then in this patch I add the block_crypto_write_func, to be used for an=
ything
but creation code, together with existing block_crypto_read_func which is a=
lready
not used for creation.
