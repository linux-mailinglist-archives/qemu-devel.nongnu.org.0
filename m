OK I just took a quick peek, two things quickly jumped out at me.

version property really should be a boolean and have some documentation
saying what functionality enables.

userspace properties should use the non-abbreviated
vm-executable since vmx is easy to confuse with vm extensions.

That's just a quick look.

Yes IMHO it needs to be fixed but please go over the comments and try to
address them all as best you can, instead of looking for an explanation
why the comments were irrelevant and can be dismissed.  Sure someone
might propose you introduce a bug, and that can't just be addressed, but
that's not the case here.  Also please do not send multiple revisions of
a large patchset in a day.  People need time for review.
