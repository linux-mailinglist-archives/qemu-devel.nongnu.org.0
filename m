Hm... Yes, in a way. But not much more than it would make sense to
report the sum of the sizes of all images in the whole backing chain
(this is a useful thing to ask for, just maybe not the right thing to
return for a low-level interface). But I can accept that it's maybe a
bit more expected for quorum and blkverify than for COW images.

If you include the block job filter nodes, I have to disagree, though.
If mirror_top_bs (or any other job filter) sits in the middle of the
source chain, then I certainly don't want to see the target size added
to it.

Do it's the quorum way: Just vote!

No, you're right, of course. -ENOTSUP is probably the only other thing
you could do then.

Well, by default the primary child, which should cover like 90% of the
drivers?
