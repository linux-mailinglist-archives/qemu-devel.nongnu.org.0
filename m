So that scenario would effectively be the old Xen style pygrub where
you have some script on the host to pull the kernel/initrd out of
the guest /boot.

On the plus side that would enable you to use a "normal" guest disk
image with unencrypted /boot, instead of encrypting everything.

The risk though is that you need a strong guarantee that the *only* data
from /boot that is used is the kernel+initrd+cmdline that get included
in the measurement. If the guest boot process reads anything else from
/boot then your confidentiality is potentially doomed. This feels like
quite a risky setup, as I don't know how you'd achieve the high level of
confidence that stuff in /boot isn't going to cause danger to the guest
during boot, or after boot.

Regards,
Daniel
