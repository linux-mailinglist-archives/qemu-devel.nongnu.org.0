Having said that, in the past we did have some pushback from people who
were staying on Ubuntu LTS releases for quite a long time, which influenc=

the decision to have a 2 year overlap. In practice that hopefully isn't t=

big a problem, as support for the other LTS distros probably means Ubuntu
LTS will work ok regardless for 2 releases.
