We previously had a general tb_flush during the MTTCG implementation as
a temporary fix. It was changed back in 406bc339b0 and it would be nice
to minimise the flushing of code if we can. While most interactive users
aren't going to notice the temporary slow down it would suck for any
automated gdb scripting.
