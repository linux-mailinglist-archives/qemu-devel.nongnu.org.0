Virt-v2v has many modes, but yes generally there will be either an NBD
source & target, or an NBD source to a local file target.

qemu-img convert has worked really well for us, and I'm actually _not_
confident that I could do better with a specialized tool.  But there's
definitely more info we could pass, such as the amount of parallelism
we believe is available in the NBD server / processors / disks.

I don't think we've really thought before about this approach.  Maybe
the launching of a VM (even an empty / stopped one) could be a
problem.  I guess this is what the new tool that was recently proposed
upstream might help with?  (Was it called qemu-block-storage?  I can't
find it right this minute)

I think this is actually one we can more easily implement as an nbdkit
filter.  I'm going to try this and see.
