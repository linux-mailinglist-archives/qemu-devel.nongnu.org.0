That only seems to save a CSEL write on line 15, during the first
iteration of the outer loop. And we would still re-select the last
selector from CNEW, in the second iteration of the outer loop.

But, again, there's no bug; I just wanted to understand your intent.

Can you please squash the following patch:

With that:

I'll also follow up with test results for this patch (meaning a lowered
"max_cpus_per_pass").

Thanks!
