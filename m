You are absolutely correct. And c471ad0e9bd46 has nothing to do with
vsock. On s390x the situation with virtio-net + vhost + iommu_platform=on
seems rather complex. I did some digging, but I have no conclusive
results yet. And I don't think we care all that much for iommu_platform=on
for old qemus.

Halil
