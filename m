I was going through the steps Jiewen and Yingwen recommended.

In step (02), the new CPU is expected to set up RAM access. In step
(03), the new CPU, executing code from flash, is expected to "send board
message to tell host CPU (GPIO->SCI) -- I am waiting for hot-add
message." For that action, the new CPU may need a stack (minimally if we
want to use C function calls).

Until step (03), there had been no word about any other (=3D pre-plugged)
CPUs (more precisely, Jiewen even confirmed "No impact to other
processors"), so I didn't assume that other CPUs had entered SMM.

Paolo, I've attempted to read Jiewen's response, and yours, as carefully
as I can. I'm still very confused. If you have a better understanding,
could you please write up the 15-step process from the thread starter
again, with all QEMU customizations applied? Such as, unnecessary steps
removed, and platform specifics filled in.

One more comment below:

(My comment below is general, and may not apply to this particular
situation. I'm too confused to figure that out myself, sorry!)

I dislike involving QEMU's generated DSDT in anything SMM (even
injecting the SMI), because the AML interpreter runs in the OS.

If a malicious OS kernel is a bit too enlightened about the DSDT, it
could willfully diverge from the process that we design. If QEMU
broadcast the SMI internally, the guest OS could not interfere with that.

If the purpose of the SMI is specifically to force all CPUs into SMM
(and thereby force them into trusted state), then the OS would be
explicitly counter-interested in carrying out the AML operations from
QEMU's DSDT.

I'd be OK with an SMM / SMI involvement in QEMU's DSDT if, by diverging
from that DSDT, the OS kernel could only mess with its own state, and
not with the firmware's.

Thanks
Laszlo
