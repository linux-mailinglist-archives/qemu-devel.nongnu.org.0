The conflicting interests here seem to be

1. Keeping pci_ide_create_devs() local to hw/ide
2. keeping things related to the board in board code and getting rid of 
init functions

I can't decide which of the above is more important or nicer but the patch 
I've proposed at least kept consistency with existing practice. If it's 
decided that board code should use pci_ide_create_devs directly instead we 
could either address that in a separate clean up series also getting rid 
of the piix init functions at the same time later or if Mark's series gets 
merged first I can rebase on that.
