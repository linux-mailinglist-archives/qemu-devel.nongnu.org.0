Trust me, you're either sure you want "=3D", or you want ":=3D".

On a green field, I recommend a hard rule "no =3D without a comment
explaining why".

Either way, we use multiple assignments to build GENERATED_QGA_FILES.
The only difference is that the version using two variables would also
work with recursive expansion, due to the magic of +=3D.
