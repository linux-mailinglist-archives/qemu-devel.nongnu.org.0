Emulate or measure? By the way there is a GSoC project proposal to add
this:

You don't need the registers at that point because at run time QEMU will
have already resolved the address and will pass it via the
qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_mem_cb. The hotpages and mem plugin examples
demonstrate the use of the API.

His tree is at:

  https://github.com/cota/qemu

But I'm not sure what his latest branch is. I've CC'd him.

As I said above I don't think you need register values to do cache
emulation as you have the addresses. You will need to decode some of the
cache management instructions though. Fortunately you can do that at
translation time and only instrument the ones you need. See howvec for
examples.
