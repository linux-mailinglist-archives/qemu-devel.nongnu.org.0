I compared that file between the downstream kernel source and upstream v4=
.15, and it looks like the following series (indeed released as part of v=
4.15) is what's missing down-stream, for this particular use case:

     1  27e64b4be4b8 regset: Add support for dynamically sized regsets
     2  94ef7ecbdf6f arm64: fpsimd: Correctly annotate exception helpers =

    27  43994d824e84 arm64/sve: Detect SVE and activate runtime support
    28  ce6990813f15 arm64/sve: Add documentation

The differences found by the simple "diff" that I mention above are mainl=
y due to commit #4 (93390c0a1b20, "arm64: KVM: Hide unsupported AArch64 C=
PU features from guests", 2017-11-03).

I found a (likely non-final) version of the cover letter too, here: https=
://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg599528.html

I guess I should convince myself to install RHEL8 on the Mustang sometime=
...

Thanks!
