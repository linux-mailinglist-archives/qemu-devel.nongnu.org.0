I'm not so sure about that. Every other architecture has ended up
standardizing on PCI for general purpose virtual machines. IIRC,
aarch64 started off with MMIO, but switched to PCI as it matured. 

In terms of having VM mgmt tools "just work" for risc-v, I think
it will be very compelling for the general 'virt' machine to be
PCI based, otherwise all the assumptions about PCI in mgmt apps
are going to break requiring never ending riscv fixes.

With regards,
Daniel
