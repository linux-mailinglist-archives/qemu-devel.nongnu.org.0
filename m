It would be better than requiring a kernel/qemu recompile :-)


Where would the whilelist live? In qemu or in the kernel? It would be 
problematic to have the whitelist in qemu if kernel driver changes could 
fix a particular card.

Beyond that, what about *always* just issuing some sort of warning 
rather than completely forbidding a card that wasn't whitelisted? 
(Haven't decided if I like that better or not (and it probably doesn't 
matter, since I'm not a "real" user, but I thought I would mention it).
