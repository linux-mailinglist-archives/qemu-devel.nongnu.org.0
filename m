You actually did not raise that expectation to me Philippe, so definitely n=
o=20
need to apologize. But I appreciate it!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAICS I'm actually not the only one being=20
affected by this double-SOB issue. A short glimpse at the logs and I see fo=
r=20
instance 3e7e134d827790c3714cae1d5b8aff8612000116 having it as well.

So I guess everyone having the following two options enabled in pwclientrc:

msgid=3Don
signoff=3Don

will have that issue.

Yes, I am aware of these. And once I got used to a new code base tree I als=
o=20
look at other ones' patches there.

I've recently been thinking whether it would be possible for QEMU=20
submaintainers to make use of patchwork's status feature:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg737917.html

Maybe that could help preventing patches of high traffic components ending =
up=20
unseen.
