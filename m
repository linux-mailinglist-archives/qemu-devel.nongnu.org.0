I don't know, so it was a pure question besides the series.  Sorry if
that holds your series somehow, it was not my intention.

Right, I think if so hard code would be fine for now, and probably can
with a smallest one across all archs (should depend on the smallest
page size, I guess).

I didn't know this.  So maybe it makes more sense to have s390 only
here.  Thanks,
