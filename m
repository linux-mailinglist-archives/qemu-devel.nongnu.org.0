Yep.

That I don't worry about too much for HMP; if your host is hosed, fix your =
host.

That I would worry about since that's probably got interactions with the
guest and spice, and all the type of things you might be trying to debug
or test.

It's certainly more important for QMP; you don't want the main lock
being held for everyday type of interactions with management layers.
