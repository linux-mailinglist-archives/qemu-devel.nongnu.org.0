QEMU BUG: #1

Alright, one of the issues is (according to comment #14):

"""
Meaning that code is waiting for a futex inside kernel.

(gdb) print rcu_call_ready_event
$4 =3D {value =3D 4294967295, initialized =3D true}

The QemuEvent "rcu_call_ready_event->value" is set to INT_MAX and I
don't know why yet.

rcu_call_ready_event->value is only touched by:

qemu_event_init() -> bool init ? EV_SET : EV_FREE
qemu_event_reset() -> atomic_or(&ev->value, EV_FREE)
qemu_event_set() -> atomic_xchg(&ev->value, EV_SET)
qemu_event_wait() -> atomic_cmpxchg(&ev->value, EV_FREE, EV_BUSY)'
"""

Now I know why rcu_call_ready_event->value is set to INT_MAX. That is
because in the following declaration:

struct QemuEvent {
#ifndef __linux__
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
    pthread_cond_t cond;
#endif
    unsigned value;
    bool initialized;
};

#define EV_SET         0
#define EV_FREE        1
#define EV_BUSY       -1

"value" is declared as unsigned, but EV_BUSY sets it to -1, and,
according to the Two's Complement Operation
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement), it will be INT_MAX
(4294967295).

So this is the "first bug" found AND it is definitely funny that this
hasn't been seen in other architectures at all... I can reproduce it at
will.

With that said, it seems that there is still another issue causing (less
frequently):

(gdb) thread 2

ch64/clone.S:78

Thread 2 to be stuck at "futex()" kernel syscall (like the FUTEX_WAKE
never happened and/or wasn't atomic for this arch/binary). Need to
investigate this also.

Title:
  qemu-img hangs on rcu_call_ready_event logic in Aarch64 when
  converting images

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  On the HiSilicon D06 system - a 96 core NUMA arm64 box - qemu-img
  frequently hangs (~50% of the time) with this command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 /tmp/cloudimg /tmp/cloudimg2

  Where "cloudimg" is a standard qcow2 Ubuntu cloud image. This
  qcow2->qcow2 conversion happens to be something uvtool does every time
  it fetches images.

  Once hung, attaching gdb gives the following backtrace:

  (gdb) bt
