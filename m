We have to perform an active commit whenever the top node has a parent
that has taken the WRITE permission on it.

This means that block-commit's @backing-file parameter is longer allowed
for such nodes, and that users will have to issue a block-job-complete
command.  Neither should pose a problem in practice, because this case
was basically just broken until now.

(Since this commit already touches block-commit's documentation, it also
moves up the chunk explaining general block-commit behavior that for
some reason was situated under @backing-file.)
