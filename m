I'll re-send the v2 with your comments addressed.

About Richard's suggestion, I believe I replied that it would require more thought
because, as it is now, it would break boards that are setting their properties after
register_cpu_props(). The overall simplification of the cpu_init() code across all
RISC-V boards is good thing to do in the future as a follow up, IMO.


Thanks,

Daniel
