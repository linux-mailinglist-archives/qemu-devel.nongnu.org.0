Are you trying to push us from idle grousing to actually improve things?
No fair!

As far as I know, all we have is the lovingly[*] written comments in
include/qom/object.h.  Sadly, we've let them rot in places.  In
particular, many newer functions are undocumented.

This is *reference* documentation.  What we lack (sorely!) is an
overview / friendly introduction, and a design document with rationale.
Reconstructing rationale now would involve guesswork.

May I present you Armbru's Comment Trust Levels:

ACTL2: The comment may be overly terse or incomplete, but the
probability for it to be outright wrong is low.

ACTL1: Treat as helpful guidance (with gratitude), but trust only the
code.

ACTL0: It is a tale Told by an idiot[**], full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Most comments in decently maintained code are at ACTL1.

Around the time initial QOM development solidified, object.h's comments
were ACTL2.  The neglect that is now clearly visible there makes me
downgrade to ACTL1.

Paolo will have a more informed and possibly different opinion.

Beware, personal opinion.

When you put documentation next to the code it documents (which you
absolutely should, because it's your only realistic chance to keep the
two in sync), then extracting API comments is useful, because it
collects them in one place.

It's of next to no use to me when the comments are all in the same place
already, namely the header.

Uff.

My qdev talks predate the rebase onto QOM.  They may well confuse /
mislead as much as inform now.

Ha, nerd sniping!

this is literature.
