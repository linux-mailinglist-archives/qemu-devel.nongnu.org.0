I've specifically patched out that check in my series... Are you
sure you're using the modified libvirt version, and that your guest
is configured to use the modified QEMU binary?

Anyway, once v4 has been posted I'll respin the libvirt series as
well, since in the meantime conflicts have popped up and it no longer
applies cleanly on top of master.
