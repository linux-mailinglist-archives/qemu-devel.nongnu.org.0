We're in perfect agreement that the user of QEMU should not need to know
anything about memory type and number of banks.  QEMU should pick a
sensible configuration for any memory size it supports.

Here's what I actually disagree with:

1. QEMU warning the user about its choice of memory type, but only
sometimes.  Why warn?  There is nothing wrong, and there is nothing the
user can do to avoid the condition that triggers the warning.

2. QEMU changing the user's memory size.  Yes, I understand that's an
attempt to be helpful, but I prefer my tools not to second-guess my
intent.

I'm removing unused code that is also broken.  If you want to keep it,
please fix it, and provide a user and/or a unit test.  Without that, it
is a trap for future callers.

Error is designed for errors, not warnings.

A function either succeeds (no error) or fails (one error).

It can be pressed into service for warnings (you did, although in a
buggy way).  You still can return at most one Error per Error **
parameter.  If you need multiple warnings, use multiple parameters
(ugh!).  You could also try to squash multiple warnings into one the
hints mechanism.

I'd advise against combining warn_report() and Error ** in one function.
A function should either take care of talking to the user completely, or
leave it to its caller completely.
