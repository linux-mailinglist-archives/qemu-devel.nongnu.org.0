FWIW, I'm pushing back against the idea that we have to compile the
BPF code from master source, as I think it is reasonable to have the
program embedded as a static array in the source code similar to what
DPDK does.  It doesn't feel much different from other places where apps
use generated sources, and don't build them from the original source
every time. eg "configure" is never re-generated from "configure.ac"
by Fedora packagers, they just use the generated "configure" script
as-is.

Daniel
