Thanks, Jan.

The "non-cosmetic" part of clearing of those entries (e.g. including
when the entries were not setup correctly rather than masked) was
never really implemented and that task has been on my todo list for
quite a while but with a very low priority (low enough to sink...).  I
hope I didn't overlook its importance since AFAICT general OSs should
hardly trigger those paths and so far I don't see it a very big issue.

Regards,
