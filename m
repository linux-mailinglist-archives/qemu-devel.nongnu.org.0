Hmm I don't like this. I propose that with VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_IN_BAND_NOTIFICATIONS
we just don't allow VHOST_USER_SET_VRING_CALL (if you think it's
important to allow them, we can say that we do not require them).

But it's important for performance to be able to enable polling.

i think polling is a separate option and should be there with inband
kicks.
