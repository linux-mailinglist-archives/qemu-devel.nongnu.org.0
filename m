Ahh, yes I see. On Z these are actually already virtualized at the LPAR
level as part of the firmware based scanning I mentioned that is the
reason for pdev->no_vf_scan. This is true even for VFs created
through sriov_numvfs in the host which is why I did not realize these
don't come from hardware, even though looking at drivers/pci/iov.c it's
pretty obvious and I did touch that code before. Sorry for the confusion.

Thank you a lot for that hint, you're absolutely right, while the
drivers do work with is_virtfn == 1 && physffn == NULL
vfio-pci gets very confused. And sorry Pierre for doubting
your is_virtfn_detached idea, this thing really is confusing.
