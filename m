The way I understand it, it tells you whether SMC is a #UD or not. 
Whether that SMC call goes into happy PSCI land or into nirvana is a 
different question - but there's nothing you can do from EL<3 to figure 
that out I believe?

Oh, absolutely! As an OS, you should look up in ACPI or DT whether to do 
an SMC call for PSCI operations or not.

The problem here is that we tell the OS in ACPI to do an SMC call, yet 
we tell it in AA64PFR0 that SMC is not implemented and thus would 
trigger a #UD.
