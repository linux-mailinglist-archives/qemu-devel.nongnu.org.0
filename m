Me neither. I grepped my qemu logs for the past, ugh, too long for the
error report that would precede these failures ("vfio-ccw: [wirte/write]
I/O region failed with errno=%d"). Excluding the ones that were
obviously the result of half-baked code, all instances were either
-EBUSY or -ENODEV.  Could I trigger one?  Maybe.  Is it likely?  Doesn't
seem to be.

It seems that getting -EIO would indicate we got ourselves out of sync,
and started buttoning up the device again (or never having opened it in
the first place), so a unit exception might be valid as a "hey
something's screwy here" ?

So maybe with all this data, and absent a better solution, it's best to
just drop this patch from v3?
