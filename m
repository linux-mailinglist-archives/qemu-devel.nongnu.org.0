I sent out an initial RFC patchset which fixes this (it's just an RFC becau=
se it only converts this one device to the new ptimer API, and we should do=
 a proper conversion of all devices); it seems to make the test case in thi=
s bug work correctly:

Title:
  arm9 clock pending (SP804)

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Hello all,

  I'm using the versatilepb board and the timer Interrupt Mask Status
  register (offset 0x14 of the SP804) does not seem to be working
  properly on the latest qemu-2.12. I tried on the 2.5 (i believe this
  is the mainstream version that comes with Linux) and it works
  perfectly.

  What happens is that the pending bit does not seem to be set in some
  scenarios. In my case, I see the timer value decreasing to 0 and then
  being reset to the reload value and neither does the interrupt is
  triggered nor the pending bit is set.

  I believe this is a matter of timing since in the "long" run the
  system eventually catches up (after a few microseconds).

  Thank you
