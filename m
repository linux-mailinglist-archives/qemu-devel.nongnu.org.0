Right, the best we have is "non-transitional":

	Devices or drivers with no legacy compatibility are referred to as non-transitional devices and drivers, re-
	spectively.

That's not coming from the spec though. You can put a transitional
device on pci-e, in some configurations legacy guests will fail to boot
but modern ones will always work.

QEMU made modern a requirement for pcie to simplify things, such
that you can always be sure transitional supports a legacy guest.
We can relax that if we like.

Told you so ;) When the TC approved the decision not to
have transitional support I tried to complain but
enough people felt there will be more devices/drivers in the
future than in the past, so we should not worry too much.

Here we are, lots of time passed and now MMIO is held
back from even offering virtio 1 by default because
people want to run legacy guests and no one has the
energy to upgrade legacy drivers.

I don't think we'll repeat the mistake again though,
so I don't really expect another incompatible upgrade.
