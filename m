No, QEMU tries to figure out which nodes must be snapshotted to capture
the current state, and if any of these nodes doesn't support snapshots,
the snapshot operation fails.

The problem when going from device based operation to node based is that
you need to figure out which nodes actually contain something that the
user wants to snapshot. For example, you usually don't want to try
creating a snapshot on the protocol node when there is a format node on
top.

What do you do with nodes that aren't attached to the guest, but maybe
used as the backend of the NBD server? What if a node is both directly
attached to some user and there is another node on top of it? In these
non-trivial cases, the default is rather arbitrary because there really
isn't a single right answer.

What QEMU currently does is snapshotting every node that is opened
read-write and either attached to a BlockBackend (i.e. is used by a
device, NBD server, or I guess as the main node of a block job) or that
doesn't have any parents (i.e. the user added it explicitly, but didn't
use it yet).

Come to think of it, the read-write condition may lead to surprising
results with dynamic auto-read-only... Good that file-posix doesn't
support snapshots and nothing else implements dynamic auto-read-only
yet.
