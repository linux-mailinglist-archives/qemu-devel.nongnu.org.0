Right. Sorry to be unclear, but I meant the emulated device (in this
case for x86 it's VT-d) should follow the hardware.  Here the page
mask is decided by VT-d in vtd_iommu_translate() for PT mode which is
4K only.  For another example, ARM SMMU is doing similar thing (return
PAGE_SIZE when PT enabled, smmuv3_translate()).  That actually makes
sense to me.  On the other hand, I'm not sure whether there's side
effect if we change this to cover the whole address space for PT.

Thanks,
