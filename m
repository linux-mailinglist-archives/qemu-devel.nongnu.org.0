Oh, I forgot that FEAT_KVM_* is recent and is not in QEMU 4.1.
If host-independent guest ABI was never guaranteed before, we're
not making it worse.

For how long was this broken?  Jiri, was libvirt including +vmx
in mode=3Dhost-model for a long time, or is this something recent?

Good.

That was the case I was worried about.

So, host-model should be fine in theory, because the CPU model
chosen by libvirt is supposed to match the host CPU.  Good.

All the other cases already had an unpredictable host-dependent
guest ABI, and can't be fixed.  Bad, but I don't think we can do
anything about it.

So:

It would be nice if we at least printed a warning when using +vmx
with pc-*-4.1 and older, so people know their configuration is
likely to be broken.
