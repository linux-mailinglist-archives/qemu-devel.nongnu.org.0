This series uses python logging to enable output conditionally on
iotests.log(). We unify an initialization call (which also enables
debugging output for those tests with -d) and then make the switch
inside of iotests.

It will help alleviate the need to create logged/unlogged versions
of all the various helpers we have made.

Also, I got lost and accidentally delinted iotests while I was here.
Sorry about that.

6: Split out the little drop of Python 3.4 code. (Phil)
7: Change line continuation styles (QEMU Memorial Choir)
11: Rebase changes; remove use_log from more places, adjust test output.

V7:

- All delinting patches are now entirely front-loaded.
- Redid delinting to avoid "correcting" no-else-return statements.
- Moved more mutable list corrections into patch 4, to make it standalone.
- Moved pylintrc up to patch 5. Disabled no-else-return.
- Added patch 6 to require line length checks.
  (Some python 3.4 compatibility code is removed as a consequence.)
- Patch 7 changes slightly as a result of patch 4 changes.
- Added some logging explainer into patch 10.
  (Patch changes slightly because of patch 6.)

V6:
 - It's been so long since V5, let's just look at it anew.
 - Dropped patch 1, rebased, added more delinting.
 - I'm not touching the supported_platforms thing.
   Not interested in rehashing that debate.

V5:
 - Rebased again
 - Allow Python tests to run on any platform

V4:
 - Rebased on top of kwolf/block at the behest of mreitz

V3:
 - Rebased for 4.1+; now based on main branch.

V2:
 - Added all of the other python tests I missed to use script_initialize
 - Refactored the common setup as per Ehabkost's suggestion
 - Added protocol arguments to common initialization,
   but this isn't strictly required.

John Snow (11):
  iotests: do a light delinting
