I refer to having machines with a N-bit main bus using a N-bit main bus
(currently all main busses are 64-bit wide).

Some 32-bit machines have access to 64-bit busses, some don't.

I have been wondering about it because of the AVR CPU which
uses a pair of busses, each less than 32-bit.

If one day I can finish my work there, the Old World mac might
benefit from it.
