This code is pre-existing, so any fixes wrt CDPATH can be done by
a different patch.

Adding "builddir=build" as an option would be introducing new
functionality that doesn't already exist. The goal is just to
do some minimal work to preserve existing functionality. If
people want control over the name of their build dir, then
they can do that by using a out-of-source tree build already.

Ah, subtle, but nice.
