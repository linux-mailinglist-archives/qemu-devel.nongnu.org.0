I think you're right. But looking at the codes, it looks like the check 
of vtd_as_has_map_notifier() was only used in:

1) vtd_iommu_replay()
2) vtd_iotlb_page_invalidate_notify() (PSI)

For the replay, it's expensive anyhow. For PSI, I think it's just about 
one or few mappings, not sure it will have obvious performance impact.

And I had two questions:

1) The codes doesn't check map for DSI or GI, does this match what spec 
said? (It looks to me the spec is unclear in this part)
2) for the replay() I don't see other implementations (either spapr or 
generic one) that did unmap (actually they skip unmap explicitly), any 
reason for doing this in intel IOMMU?
