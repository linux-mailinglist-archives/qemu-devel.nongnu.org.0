It _is_ possible to set up a format node on top of another; in fact, our 
testsuite does that in at least iotest 072.  I agree that setups like 
'qcow2 - qcow2 - file' are uncommon, but the setup 'qcow2 - raw - file' 
may be useful for extracting a partition of a raw disk when it is known 
that the partition in that disk itself contains qcow2 data.

Aha - nested formats ARE still allowed when you explicitly request it 
(which is what iotest 72 does) - what you are stating here is that 
implicit probing of is forbidden for a parent declared as a format 
driver.  That makes more sense.

I'm not sure if the commit message needs a tweak, but the patch itself 
is sane as-is.
