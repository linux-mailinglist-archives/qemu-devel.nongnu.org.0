Title:
  qemu-system-i386 eats a lot of cpu after just few hours,  with
  sdl,gl=3Don

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I already send this email to qemu-discuss@nongnu.org , but I can't see
  it arriving in archives, so here  is copy.

  Hello, all!

  I use qemu-system-i386/qemu-system_x86_64 for rebuilding Slax-like live c=
d/dvd.
  Usually guests (with various self-compiled kernels and X stack with kde3 =
on top of them)
  boot up normally, but if I left them to run in GUI mode for few hours - q=
emu process on host
  started to eat more and more cpu for itself - more notiecable if I set ho=
st cpu to lowest possible
  frequency via trayfreq applet (1400Mhz in my case).

  Boot line a bit complicated, but I really prefer to have sound and usb in=
side VM.
  qemu-system-i386 -cdrom /dev/shm/CDROM-4.4.194_5.iso -m 1.9G -enable-kvm =
-soundhw es1370 -smp 2 -display sdl,gl=3Don -usb -cpu host -rtc clock=3Dvm

  rtc clock=3Dvm was taken from https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/117465=
4 but apparently not helping.
  After just 3 hours of uptime (copied line from 'top' on host)

  31943 guest     20   0 2412m 791m  38m R   51  6.7  66:36.51 qemu-
  system-i38

  I use Xorg 1.19.7 on host, with mesa git/nouveau as GL driver. But my car=
d has not very big amount of VRAM - only 384Mb.
  May be this limitation is playing some role .. but 'end-user' result was =
after 1-2 day of guest uptime I run into completely frozen guest =

  (may be when qemu was hitting 100 one core usage on host some internal ti=
mer just made guest kernel too upset/froze?
   I was sleeping or doing other things on host  for all this time, with VM=
 just supposedly running at another virtual desktop - =

  in KDE3 + built-in compositor ....)

  I wonder if more mainstream desktop users (on GNOME, Xfce, etc) and/or us=
ers of other distros (I use self-re-compiled Slackware)
  actually can see same problem?

  qemu-system-i386 --version
  QEMU emulator version 4.1.50 (v4.1.0-1188-gc6f5012ba5-dirty)
  but I saw same behavior for quite some time .. just never reported it in =
hope it will go away.

  [and 3x more of the same, for 3 remaining cores]

  Gcc is Slackware 14.2's gcc 5.5.0, but I saw this with 4.9.2 too.
  This might be 32-bit host problem. But may be just no-one tried to run qe=
mu with GUI guest for literaly days?

  Host kernel is
   uname -a
  Linux slax 5.1.12-x64 #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Jun 19 12:31:05 MSK 2019 x86_64 =
AMD FX(tm)-4300 Quad-Core Processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux

  I was trying newish 5.3.2 but my compilation was not as stable as this on=
e =

  (I tend to change few things, like max cpu count, preemption mode, numa s=
upport .... =

  for more distribution-like, yet most stable  and performant for me kernel)

  Kernel world is moving fast, so I'll try to recompile new 5.3.x too
  ....

  =

  I guess I  should provide perf/profiler output, but for  this I need to r=
ecompile qemu. =

  I'll try to come back with more details soon.

  Thanks for your attention and possible feedback!
