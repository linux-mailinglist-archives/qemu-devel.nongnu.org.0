Uh.. I thought about it, but I don't think it matters much which way
we do it.

Argh.  Dammit.  I could have sworn I checked that chassis numbers were
supposed to be unique (and not guest alterable).  That's the whole
reason I chose it.

Well, technically.  But the method we had before was *way* more broken
than chassis numbers.  It was using bus number which is not stable
across the VM's lifetime, which is a non-starter.  Plus, the bus
number too won't be unique, until the guest has enumerated the bus,
which is too late for DRC creation.

The only reason we got away with it, was that it was basically dead
code - at that stage we didn't support hotplug under bridges, so we
never actually created DRCs except for the root bus.

Well, again, only on a technicality.  It might not have immediatley
assert()ed, but adding a duplicated DRC was still completely broken
before that.

At this stage, I'd kind of prefer to merge this fix now, with the
intention of doing a pull request tomorrow.  AFAICT none of the
suggested improvements can't be done as followups.

In fact the main part of the polish I was thinking of didn't really
work out.  The only change I made was a tiny move to the check (it's
not really relevant until *after* we've checked if hotplug is enabled
at all).  So I just folded that in and put it into the ppc-for-5.1
tree.
