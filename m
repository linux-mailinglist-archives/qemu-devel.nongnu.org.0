I haven=E2=80=99t worked on the next version yet, but that=E2=80=99s just=
 because other
things were more important, not because of reviews.

Because this function is about the 'backing' option.  As I explained
above, this must correspond to a bs->backing child.  If there is an
implicit filter, it will still be under bs->backing.
