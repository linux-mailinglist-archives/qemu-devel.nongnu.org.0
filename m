It's just a bad interface for QEMU to use. Maybe it's good for vmware,

OK that is already a conflict with the license of vmport.c
which is copyleft. Respecting wishes of the original
author is not a legal requirement, but sure is a nice thing to do.

I suggest we keep clear of this.

Refer to it if you like but don't copy.

And "no later version" will conflict with a bunch of other
files which are 2 or later.
We can't avoid GPL v2 but we really shouldn't just add it
without any good reason.

All enum names too. Supposed to be CamelCase. Again VMX is=20

They might make sense in the context of the specific project.
They aren't official names - just internal strings within a file.

So imagine: as a user, I want to set this to some reasonable value.

Supposedly this is why you have the enum there in the
1st place right? Let's see how does all this help me:

- first enum is VMX_TYPE_UNSET. Unset? I guess that's
the default. I want to set it, make sure it's a good value.
- next one is VMX_TYPE_EXPRESS. comment says deprecated though.
  I will keep clear.
- Next enum is VMX_TYPE_SCALABLE_SERVER. Hmm that says ESX.
I guess it's good! However what's scalable server?
There's no vmware in sight,
brings up unrelated search results.
Scalable server? No I need to research that.
I guess I will just ignore all this and go by the comments.
Okay! Wait so what is the value I need to supply to the
property?
Oh right I need to recall that enum values are sequential.
So first one it says is 0. Let me count. It's 2 I guess.

Okay I will try ...

Because that lets you use english. Look you didn't even list options.
User's supposed to do the math in his/her head. Why is that?
Oh because we lifted this wholesale from some other header.

No - it just assigns names to constants. If you then proceed not to use
the names, then it's pointless.

I felt this bears repetition.
But sure, you can drop it in DEFINE_PROP_UINT8 if you like.
If you really feel you must, do:

#define VM_PORT_DEFAULT_VM_EXECUTABLE 2
near the comment.

Acronims is a bad idea in user interfaces if avoidable, or unless
universal. Either these interfaces are needed or they aren't.
I question their usefulness, but if they are useful they should
have names that do not require guesswork to understand.
