I think libvirt needs to just unconditionally remove unpack from host-model
regardless, and require an explicit opt in. We can do that in libvirt
without compat problems, because we track the expansion of "host-model"
for existing running guests.

QEMU could introduce a deprecation warning right now, and then turn it into
an error after the deprecation cycle is complete.
