This code has moved around a bit over it's life; joining the case
needed by balloon and the case needed by postcopy.

I think because internally to Linux the behaviour is the same;
this causes the mapping to disappear from the TLB so it faults;
normally when reading the kernel resolves the fault and puts
a read-as-zero page there, except if userfault was enabled
for postcopy, in which case it gives us a kick and we service it.

Yes, I don't think there's any equivalent to madvise
that guarantees anything.

Yes, but I can't remember the semantics fully - I think it was because
we needed the guarantee at this point (and even Linux's
posix madvise did something different??)

I've got a note saying we didn't want to use
qemu_madvise because we wanted to be sure we didn't get
posix_madvise.
