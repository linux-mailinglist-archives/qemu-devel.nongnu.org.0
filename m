This comment sounds like it's documenting what was the
previous default ("were considered") and making a minimal
change to avoid breaking existing code where a device
does want to be hotpluggable but isn't explicitly saying so.
I forget how exactly it works (the mechanism has changed
several times) but in practice a sysbus device is generally
not hotpluggable, and that's what most devices are.

Note that you don't need an instance_finalize() if it
would have nothing to do, which may be the case here.

Not sure which device this is, I couldn't find a TYPE_
define with this name. Is it an abstract or common
device type used by the hotpluggable pci VGA card?

Most of these are not really hotpluggable. What is
confusing your test code is that sysbus devices get
the default 'hotpluggable =3D true' setting, but other
conditions usually prevent hotplugging. (The reason
hotpluggable is true is the default is because of
handling of 'dynamic sysbus' devices which live on
the 'platform bus'.) In particular, I think that
anything with !dc->user_creatable can't be hotplugged
unless board code specifically tries it, which would
be a bug for most of these devices.

Also, if there isn't anything for a device's unrealize
method to do, it doesn't need to provide one.
