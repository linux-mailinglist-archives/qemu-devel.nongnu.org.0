PMR file is mmaped into address space. If memory accesses are made outside of 
file then SIGBUS signal is raised. Preallocation requirement was introduced
to prevent this situation.

Agree. I couldn't find QEMU backend ensuring persistence - thus decided to
go with mmap.

Yes I can research this topic. Does HostMemoryBacked provide persistence?
