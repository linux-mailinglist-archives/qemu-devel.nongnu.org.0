I guess what I meant by problems is that it made what was previously a
simple and straightforward implementation into something more complex
and added some limitations.  For example, we now need to parse the
result of the listxattr system call and strip out the prefix from any
name in the list.  It also means that we cannot allow the guest to
directly set or remove any "user.virtiofs." xattr as this would allow
an unprivileged process in the vm to modify an xattr that it wouldn't
otherwise be allowed to modify.  On top of being a somewhat arbitrary
restriction this also means that you can't have stacked virtiofs
instances as the lower instance would reject attempts by the upper one
to set those xattrs.  These limitations aren't really a problem for us
but I can see how they might be a problem for others.

The change was also merged just yesterday so there may be other
problems with it that haven't surfaced yet.

I didn't mention it before because I figured this was something that
we brought upon ourselves as chrome os is a bit extreme about
sandboxing.  If we can come up with a standardized way to handle this
I think we'll gladly switch the chrome os implementation to use it.
