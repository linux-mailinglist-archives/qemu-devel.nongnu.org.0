That is not the case when migration is using TLS, because the buffers
transmitted are the ciphertext buffer, not the plaintext guest page.

All the APIs that exist today are fundamentally only suitable for sync
operations. Supporting async correctly will definitely a brand new APIs
separate from what exists today.
