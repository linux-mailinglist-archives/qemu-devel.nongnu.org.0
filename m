(From dumps Babu has provided earlier, it was dies =3D=3D nodes and
CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX =3D=3D numa node ids in SRAT.)

dumping CPUID_Fn8000001E and SRAT table for such configs will help us
to figure out if we need socket*dies !=3D nodes and how to compose config
were SRAT differs from CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX.

Babu, can you provide CPUID_Fn8000001E and SRAT dumps for
above configs combinations? Or to some spec/guide how it should be.
