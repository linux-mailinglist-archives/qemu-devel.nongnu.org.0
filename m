It has certainly grown more warty as we've gone on. For one thing we
don't cleanly handle different host architectures.

 make run-tcg-tests-cris-softmmu V=3D1

and you'll see the docker invocation underneath.

 make docker-test-build

Should run all QEMU builds on all images that support it. Works in testing/=
next.

So generally once built you can re-use an image with cross compilers to
build any random source tree. Usually you invoke docker directly with
something like:

  docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) qemu:debian-ub=
untu-bionic-arm64 /bin/bash

Which basically drops you into a shell with your build directory mapped
into the docker image. However this usage is out of scope for the QEMU
build machinery although a useful way to use the images.

3c. Images that can build tests that run with QEMU

These are minimal cross compilers with just the foreign glibc and can
build our minimal tcg test cases.
