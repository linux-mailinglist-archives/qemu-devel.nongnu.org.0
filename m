Honestly, I don't know what things will look like one year from now.  I 
don't have 100% of the vision of how things will look, just enough to 
make informed guesses at each step.  So far I think it's gone pretty 
well, at the expense of some churn indeed.

What I know If the compiler tests do move back to tests/tcg, they 
probably won't look anything like the code that is there now.

In fact, they might even be done in Makefiles instead of configure, 
similar to the "cc-option" macro in pc-bios/optionrom/Makefile.  My plan 
was to experiment with that in pc-bios/optionrom, in the context of 
supporting docker-based cross-compilers, and then move whatever solution 
I come up with to tests/tcg.

If you prefer that I first try moving them to Makefiles to reduce future 
churn in the main configure script, I can do that, but probably not 
until ~August.

Paolo
