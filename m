I feel your pain and agree.

How can this get improved?

Keeping the command line backward compatible is not an easy task.

There is a quite important effort in progress to improve the documentation.

Users reporting bad/incomplete/outdated documentation would help and=20
motivate developers to fix it. That would reduce the gap between=20
developers implementing features and users.

Do you other have suggestions about what should be improved?

Thanks,

Phil.
