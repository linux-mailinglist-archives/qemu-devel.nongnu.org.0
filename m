I'm chiefly after PEP 526 "Syntax for Variable Annotations" for much
saner type hints.  John's "[PATCH 00/37] qapi: static typing conversion
pt1" already uses it, because not using it results in illegible code.

Nice to have: PEP 498 "Literal String Interpolation" may let us improve
QAPI code geneator readability.  I haven't tried, yet.

<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/#features-for-3-6> has the
full list of new features.

Understood.

Anyone writing Python code in QEMU has paid a price for this policy.  I
certainly did.  I'm okay with that as long as it helps more than it
hurts.

Lack of sane type hints is hurting QAPI developement.

I believe requiring 3.6 will hurt QEMU less than hobbled QAPI
development.
