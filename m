I think the problem with the Fedora acceptance is that we'll be constantly
chasing a moving target. Every URL we pick will go away 6-12 months later.
IOW, while the acceptance test pass today, in 6 months time they'll be
failing.  IOW,  switching to F32 doesn't solve the root cause, it just
pushs the problem down the road for 6 months until F32 is EOL and hits
the same URL change problem.

One way to avoid this is to *not* actually  test a current Fedora.
Instead intentionally point at an EOL Fedora release whose URL has
already moved to the archive site which is long term stable.

Regards,
Daniel
