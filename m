Right, the Avocado bits have been merged, so unless a major reversal
comes (not expected at all), it will be on Avocado 74.0.

This is clearly not a "kernel build" test, so we should avoid building
the kernel as part of the "PVH boot" test.  The problem you expose
here is a very real, and each possible solution has its own problems,
unfortunately.

The best solution IMO would be to find a "well known" distribution of
such a kernel.  Maybe something maintained by the Xen project or one
of its commercial products?

The second best solution is to have a helper script (using the Avocado
utils API is fine) that will build a kernel and create/populate the
test's data directory (tests/acceptance/pvh.py.data/) with a vmlinux.
The test can cancel itself if it doesn't find a kernel there.

The third best solution IMO is for this test to require a parameter
telling where the CONFIG_PVH enabled vmlinux kernel image is.

Also notice that, with a custom built kernel image (a different one
for each user), the result of the test as a general indicator to the
QEMU codebase diminishes quite a bit.

I'm pretty sure that building the kernel will cause a major slow down
of the Travis CI results for the "acceptance" block (and thus for the
overall results).  But, it may also time it out (there's a 50 minutes
deadline).

I hope this brings some ideas, and thanks for coming up with
interesting problems! :)

- Cleber.
