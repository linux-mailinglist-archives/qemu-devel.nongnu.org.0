I don't see a problem, we can use 3-digit versions that won't be
enabled by any machine type by default.

That's exactly what I did for Cascadelake-Server, see patch 6/6.

This is possible too.  It would require a more complex mapping
between machine types and CPU model versions, though.  Maybe this
is worth the extra complexity because it would make the external
interfaces simpler.

I think I'm liking this approach.  If we're untying CPU models
from machine types, let's do it all the way.
