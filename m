We have the guest, linux stubdom with qemu, & dom0. Are you concerned
that all of them need a minimum of page alignment?

Linux PCI subsytem has an option resource_alignment that can be
applied to either a single device or all devices.  Booting with
pci=3Dresource_aligment=3D4096 will align each device to a page.  Do you
think pciback should force resource_alignment=3D4096 for dom0?  Are
there other MMIO ranges to be concerned about adjacent to BARs?

On my one test machine with a BAR smaller than 4096, the firmware
already sets an alignment of 4096.  Linux dom0 seems to keep the
firmware BAR alignment by default.
