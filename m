Or 'kbd' instead of 'evdev' is fine too

That shouldn't be a problem, as its a different level in the stack

There's two translations happening

 * The scancode emitted by the kernel and/or hardware device,
   and then translated/mangled by X11 and reported as the
   hardware keycode

 * The keysym which is the mapping from the hardware keycode
   done by XKB and/or Xmodmap

The 2nd point here doesn't matter for QEMU.

We're dealing with the first point in QEMU, taking the hardware
keycode and trying to undo the X11 mangling that was performed.
This mangling is different depending on whether the X11 server
is using 'evdev' or 'kbd' as its input driver.

So the key thing to understand is what values your X11 server
is using for the hardware keycodes.

Ok, that's useful info to know.

Can you launch 'xev' inside your VNC session and press the 'Page Up'
button and let me know what it reports the keycode and keysym.

Specifically I'm interested in this line of text:

    state 0x0, keycode 112 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,

On evdev it reports 112 as hardware code which is 0x70 hex, while with
'kbd' it reports 99 which is 0x63 hex. These are the only two scenarios
QEMU knows how to cope with.

I'm strongly suspecting your X11 server will report something different
from either evdev or kbd driver hardware codes.

For that matter, if you have time to help, it would be interesting to
see what it reports for a random selection of other keys too. For
example:

  @
  #
  $
  `
  -
  +
  1
  2
  3
  a
  s
  d
  q
  w
  e
  ,
  .
