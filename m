For CMD646 we only use PCI interrupt which is in PCIDevice. Its legacy 
mode and thus those pins are not modelled so not needed now. For via-ide 
we only use ISA interrupts because even if we don't model legacy mode, 
boards expect ISA interrupts also in native mode maybe because this 
controller is not a separate PCI device only found embedded in 
southbridge/superio chips where they connect to the also embedded ISA PICs 
so even in native mode it should raise one of the ISA IRQs. My patch 
accesses ISA irqs with isa_get_irq() so no gpios and legacy irqs in 
PCIIDEState is neeeded and I don't see the need to introduce this 
complexity here. Also newer PCI ATA and SATA controllers such as sii3112 
do not have a legacy mode so I'd keep things related to that out of common 
PCI IDE code and model it instead in the controllers that have this as 
this does not seem to belong to PCI IDE.

But it's not done that way on real hardware and via-ide is not a PCI 
device but all this is internal to the VT8231 chip, the PICs, via-ide and 
a lot of other things which are modelled in QEMU by reusing existing 
components but I think we don't want to model the internal of the chip 
down to the smallest detail. In via-ide's case the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE is 
probably not used by the IDE controller function but is used by some other 
function of the southbridge chip that implements interrupt controller but 
we don't have a separate model of that in QEMU so we can just emulate this 
function within via-ide which I think is OK as this IDE controller is part 
of these southbridges and not used anywhere else. This partly mixes IDE 
controller function and interrupt controller function but probably OK 
until we want to model this southbridge in more detail which could be done 
in later clean up patches. The piix model seems to do the same embedding a 
8259 which even less belongs to an IDE controller and acceses irqs array 
directly.

Correct or not or follows the spec or not this is how it works on real 
hardware and to get guests running we need to emulate this. Again, this 
controller is embedded in the 868B and 8231 southbridge chips so they may 
not completely confirm to PCI spec but their own datasheets. We can argue 
in how much detail do we want to model the internals of these chips (which 
we don't know for sure) but I think this patch is good enough for now and 
could be refined later or we likely won't be able to finish this before 
the freeze.

Another way to look at it is that this patch gets some guests running and 
does not break anything as far as I know so is there anything in it that's 
unacceptable now and needs to be changed for it to be merged? Unless you 
can propose a way to achieve the same in a simpler way now I think we 
could go with this and you can submit follow up patches to clean it up as 
you like later.
