The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  [feature request] Partition table wrapper for single-filesystem images

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Suppose you have a single filesystem image. It would be nice if QEMU
  could generate a virtual partition table for it and make it available
  to the guest as a partitioned disk. Otherwise you have to use
  workarounds like this:
  wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU#Simulate_virtual_disk_with_MBR_using_li=
near_RAID

  It should be relatively easy to do on top of existing vvfat code.
