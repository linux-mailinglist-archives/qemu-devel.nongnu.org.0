Originally I thought the same, but it's actually not enough. The
external process needs not only stdio connected to the chardev, but also
another file descriptor for a QMP socket.

I guess tab completion should be possible if we can turn off line
buffering. Not sure what's the problem with formatting.

I would certainly expect that any QMP/HMP shell code uses the existing
QEMUMonitorProtocol Python class. qmp-shell already does.

Maybe they could share a bit more (command parsing?) if we want to have
separate scripts for HMP and QMP. Though actually I think I like the
idea of a combined QMP/HMP shell better at the moment.
