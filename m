Agreed that kvm:tcg fallback I suggested isn't a good idea.
However, do we really want to require a separate test method to
be written just because we want to use a different accelerator or
other QEMU option?

This patch may be the simplest solution short term, but can we
have something that doesn't require so much code duplication and
boilerplate code in the future?
