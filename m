Hello,

thanks for your replies.

I must admit that I don't fully understand your analysis.
However you made some conclusions that are correct.

In fact I have found a Github repo 
<https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel> where a specific kernel 
and versatile-pb are provided + instructions for lauching the emulation 
with the original RPi image file:
$ qemu-system-arm \
   -M versatilepb \
   -cpu arm1176 \
   -m 256 \
   -drive 
"file=/.../2020-05-27-raspios-buster-lite-armhf.img,if=none,index=0,media=disk,format=raw,id=disk0" 
\
   -device 
"virtio-blk-pci,drive=disk0,disable-modern=on,disable-legacy=off" \
   -net "user,hostfwd=tcp::5022-:22" \
   -dtb /.../versatile-pb-buster-5.4.51.dtb \
   -kernel /.../kernel-qemu-5.4.51-buster \
   -append 'root=/dev/vda2 panic=1' \
   -no-reboot

This means it is more recent than the Raspberry Pi Geek article, and the 
emulation works.
But I'm not sure if this usable considering the added models -M raspi2 
and -M raspi3.

Can you please advise how to proceed?

In addition I would like to know if there's a memory limitation using 
models -M raspi2 and -M raspi3?
To my understanding there's a limitation to 256MB using -M versatilepb.
If yes, I consider to another raw image located on host's temporary 
filesystem and use this a swap in the client.

And how can I make use of a client network device that is based on 
host's tap device connected to a network bridge?

THX
