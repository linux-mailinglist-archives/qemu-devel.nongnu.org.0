Pre-release period, time to deprecate some stuffs :)

How should we proceed? Do you have something in mind?

There are older threads about this. Should we start a new thread? Gather 
the different ideas on the Wiki?

(Obviously you are not the one responsible of this topic, you just 
happen to be the last one worried about it on the list).

Regards,

Phil.
