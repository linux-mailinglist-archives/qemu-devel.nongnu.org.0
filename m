This tries to simplify the init_guest_space code to be a little less
convoluted and remove the brute force mapping algorithm that gets
tripped up so badly by the sanitizers.

We first try to do what is requested by the host. Failing that we try
and satisfy the guest requested base address. If all those options
fail we fall back to finding a space in the memory map using our
recently written read_self_maps() helper.

Less mind-binding gotos and hopefully clearer logic although perhaps
more sloppy casting than I'm totally happy with.
