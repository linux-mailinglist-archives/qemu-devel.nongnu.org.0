Who provides the OpenFirmware entry point when you remove SLOF and boot
directly into grub?

Or alternatively it is possible with my patchset to load petitboot (kernel

Why wouldn't that have the same issue as SLOF that you describe below (I
honestly don't understand anything of it, but that's not your fault :-)).
