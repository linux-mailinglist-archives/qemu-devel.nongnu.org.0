That's very strange.
None of the patches affect RR for AArch64. Is this the real failure or 
just a coincidence?
I also tried running this test on my local machine and got normal 
execution time for replay:
real	0m0,968s
user	0m0,657s
sys	0m0,625s

By the way, this is an early RR test. Now we have more complex (and 
easier to reproduce) avocado-based RR tests (for aarch64 too).
I.e. record and replay in this test are divided into two "tests",
and can cause races if running in parallel for some reason.

Shouldn't we just drop this one?
