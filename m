Do we have the data to know that a device is unplugged?
I think that it would be just easier just queue that command.  Let the
guest unplug whatever it wants, and on destination, once that we know
that we have finish migration, we just do the rest of the staff.

As stated on the thread, we really want _not_ to have hotplug/unplug
during migration, but if a guest can initiate one, we can only "delay"
the bits that happen inside qemu.

Later, Juan.
