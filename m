This second part of your suggested comment could be dropped, as far as
I'm concerned. If anything, it's part of the contract and would belong
in the bdrv_recurse_can_replace() documentation.

However, I think I would mention why not being 100% is okay: The part
with "additional safeguard to prevent the user from doing stupid
things", and that it doesn't make a difference if the user runs the
correct command.
