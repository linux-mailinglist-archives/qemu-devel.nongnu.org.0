Okay this makes sense.

There needs to be a consensus on whether to go with a qdev-over-socket
approach that is QEMU-specific and strongly discourages third-party
device distribution or a muser-over-socket approach that offers a stable
API for VMM interoperability and third-party device distribution.

Interoperability between VMMs and also DPDK/SPDK is important because
they form today's open source virtualization community.  No one project
or codebase covers all use cases or interesting developments.  If we are
short-sighted and prevent collaboration then we'll become isolated.

On the other hand, I'm personally opposed to proprietary vendors that
contribute very little to open source.  We make that easier by offering
a stable API for third-party devices.  A stable API discourages open
source contributions while allowing proprietary vendors to benefit from
the work that the open source community is doing.

One way to choose a position is to balance up the open source vs
proprietary applications of a stable API.  At this point in time I think
the DPDK/SPDK and rust-vmm communities bring enough to the table that
it's worth fostering collaboration through a stable API.  The benefit of
having the stable API is large enough that the disadvantage of making
life easier for proprietary vendors can be accepted.

This is just a more elaborate explanation for the "the cat is out of the
bag" comments that have already been made on licensing.  Does anyone
still disagree or want to discuss further?

If there is agreement that a stable API is okay then I think the
practical way to do this is to first merge a cleaned-up version of
multi-process QEMU as an unstable experimental API.  Once it's being
tested and used we can write a protocol specification and publish it as
a stable interface when the spec has addressed most use cases.

Does this sound good?

Stefan
