Let's give it a try then. I would introduce a new QOM interface,
something like  :

     #define TYPE_GPIO_INTERFACE "gpio-interface"
     #define GPIO_INTERFACE(obj)                                     \
         INTERFACE_CHECK(GpioInterface, (obj), TYPE_GPIO_INTERFACE)
     typedef struct GpioInterfaceClass GpioInterfaceClass;
     DECLARE_CLASS_CHECKERS(GpioInterfaceClass, GPIO_INTERFACE,
                            TYPE_GPIO_INTERFACE)
     
     struct GpioInterfaceClass {
         InterfaceClass parent;
         int (*get)(GpioInterface *gi, ...);
         int (*set)(GpioInterface *gi, ...);
         ...
     };

and implement the interface handlers under the AspeedGPIO model.
The SPI GPIO model would have a link to such an interface to drive
the GPIO pins.

See IPMI and XIVE for some more complete models.

yes. something like that.

yes.

we could use qdev_init_gpio_out_named() instead of sysbus_init_irq()
to name them.

The IRQ line is not raised ?

So much is happening in that mode. We need more trace events in the Aspeed
GPIO model at least an extra in aspeed_gpio_update()
