The magic is 07a itself, IIUC. The CPU hotplug controller would be
accessible only in SMM. And until 07a happens, the new CPU ignores
INIT/SIPI/SIPI even if another CPU sends it those, simply because QEMU
would implement the new CPU's behavior like that.

We do have physical PCI(e) device assignment; sorry for not highlighting
that earlier. That feature (VFIO) does rely on the (physical) IOMMU, and
it makes sure that the assigned device can only access physical frames
that belong to the virtual machine that the device is assigned to.

However, as far as I know, VFIO doesn't try to restrict PCI DMA to
subsets of guest RAM... I could be wrong about that, I vaguely recall
RMRR support, which seems somewhat related.

I think that would be a VFIO feature.

Alex: if we wanted to block PCI(e) DMA to a specific part of guest RAM
(expressed with guest-physical RAM addresses), perhaps permanently,
perhaps just for a while -- not sure about coordination though --, could
VFIO accommodate that (I guess by "punching holes" in the IOMMU page
tables)?
