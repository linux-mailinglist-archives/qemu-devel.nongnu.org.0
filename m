Hmm... OS enforcing load-after-store based on a PVR ? I can't find
such a thing in the kernel sources. What I find is:

	if (offset =3D=3D XIVE_ESB_SET_PQ_10 && xd->flags & XIVE_IRQ_FLAG_STORE_EO=
I)
		offset |=3D XIVE_ESB_LD_ST_MO;

where xd->flags comes from H_INT_GET_SOURCE_INFO, so this essentially
depends on what the hypervisor advertises. For example a P9 compat
guest could use it if QEMU has an emulated XIVE, right ?

Yeah I know that the guest doesn't ask for StoreEOI. What I mean is that
the idea behind spapr capabilities is only about saying "this machine type
offers this feature and the host supports it". The fact that the guest
might use it or not is another matter. So I don't quite see how "cas" fits
into this model...

>=20

I think there's confusion here. Setting the capability to "on"/"off"
doesn't mean your force anything. As said above, this isn't related
to what the guest supports but essentially to what the host supports.
"on" means that we can offer the feature to the guest in a reliable
manner because we have verified it can work, and "off" simply means
we don't offer the feature (but of course the guest is still free
to shoot itself in the foot).

The reference to what pHyp does is thus irrelevant here because we
won't ever migrate a guest between KVM and PowerVM. We could decide
to do nothing and let the OS only do "LoadEOI" operations as it does
today.

If we want StoreEOI to be usable by default, then the default value
should definitely be "on". This should be kept to "off" for older
machine types to stay compatible with existing setups.

Let's only consider the KVM case only because we don't explicitly
support KVM<->TCG migration. The availability of StoreEOI is:
- emulated XIVE on P9 system =3D> ok
- emulated XIVE on P10 system =3D> ok
- in-kernel XIVE on P10 system =3D> ok
- in-kernel XIVE on P9 system =3D> not ok

This means that on a P9 system we must fallback on emulated XIVE, like
we already do with bostons today. This might look sub-optimal from a
performance standpoint but this is the price to pay to guarantee
migration doesn't fail with the default settings.

>=20

I understand that having fine grain knobs is cool for tests and performance
but keep in mind that we mostly target end-users who expect this to work
out of the box with the default settings. This being said, if some end-users
might hit a corner case where it would be valuable to switch it off, then
it makes sense to keep the ability to do so of course.
