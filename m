Perhaps rewriting the obsolete file comment would be better.  Something
like this:

    /*
     * This header is for selectively avoiding #include just to get a
     * typedef name.
     *
     * Declaring a typedef name in its "obvious" place can result in
     * inclusion cycles, in particular for complete struct and union
     * types that need more types for their members.  It can also result
     * in headers pulling in many more headers, slowing down builds.
     *
     * You can break such cycles and unwanted dependencies by declaring
     * the typedef name here.
     *
     * For struct types used in only a few headers, judicious use of the
     * struct tag instead of the typedef name is commonly preferable.
     */

    /*
     * Incomplete struct types
     * Please keep this list in case-insensitive alphabetical order.
     */
    typedef struct AdapterInfo AdapterInfo;
    [...]

    /*
     * Pointer types
     * Such typedefs should be limited to cases where the typedef's users
     * are oblivious of its "pointer-ness".
     * Please keep this list in case-insensitive alphabetical order.
     */
    typedef struct IRQState *qemu_irq;

    /*
     * Function types
     */
    typedef void SaveStateHandler(QEMUFile *f, void *opaque);
    typedef int LoadStateHandler(QEMUFile *f, void *opaque, int version_id);
    typedef void (*qemu_irq_handler)(void *opaque, int n, int level);

What do you think?
