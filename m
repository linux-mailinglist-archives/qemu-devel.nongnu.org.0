I haven't actually measured due to lack of time experimenting with it and 
those who I've asked to check it only reported it felt a bit faster but no 
numerical measurements so that does not prove anything. Anyway these 
special cases should not hurt and simple enough to have it here even if 
may not improve performance very much. The biggest loss is probably 
converting 16 bit screen on every display update to 32 bit because the 
guest driver does not allow higher bit depth than 16 for some reason. But 
I don't plan to spend more time with improving sm501, only done it because 
I had to touch it anyway. Longer term plan is to finish ati-vga which 
should have better guest drivers and better performance.

OK, I never know these and they are a bit hard to find because they are 
defined as glued together macros so grepping for it does not show the 
definition. Maybe adding a comment with the names where these are defined 
in bswap.h might help. stn_he_p seems to ultimately call __builtin_memcpy 
that probably does the same direct assignment for short values. I wonder 
how much overhead that has going through all the function calls but 
hopefully those are inlined.
