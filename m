I'm curious why; 'virt' is a versioned machine type, the whole point of
versioned machine types is you're allowed to change the behaviour of
them between versions of qemu.   If people want their command lines
to stay stable they can specify a version, i.e. -M virt-4.2 and
know that it won't change.
