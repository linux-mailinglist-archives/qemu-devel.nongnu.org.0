Just to be clear, I have suggested using bits (or bytes or megabytes
depending on the exact value) only for the command-line-user-oriented
sve-vl-max option, which would take a single value.

For interoperation with the management layer, on the other hand,
using a bitmap is perfectly fine, and whether the values encoded
within are expressed in quadwords or whatever other format is largely
irrelevant, so long as it it's properly documented of course.
