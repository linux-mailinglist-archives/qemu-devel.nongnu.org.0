Hm.  Sorry, I find this all a bit hard to understand.  (No comments and
all.)

I understand that this is for an RO -> RW transition?  Everything is
still RO, but the parent will need an RW child before it transitions to
RW itself.


I=E2=80=99m going to be honest up front, I don=E2=80=99t like this very m=
uch.  But I
think it may be a reasonable solution for now.

As I remember, the problem was that when reopening a qcow2 node from RO
to RW, we need to write something in .prepare() (because it can fail),
but naturally no .prepare() is called after any .commit(), so no matter
the order of nodes in the ReopenQueue, the child node will never be RW
by this point.

Hm.  To me that mostly means that making the whole reopen process a
transaction was just a dream that turns out not to work.

OK, so what would be the real, proper, all-encompassing fix?  I suppose
we=E2=80=99d need a way to express reopen dependency relationships.  So i=
f a
node depends on one or more of its children to be reopened before/after
it can be reopened itself, we=E2=80=99d need to pull them out of the Reop=
enQueue
(along with their dependencies) and do a separate bdrv_reopen_multiple()
on them.  So we=E2=80=99d want to split the ReopenQueue into as few subqu=
eues as
possible, so that all dependencies are satisfied.

One such dependency is if you change a node from RO to RW, and that
change requires an RW child.

The reverse dependency occurs is if you change a node from RW to RO, and
the nodes wants to write something to its child, so it needs to remain
RW until then.

Currently, the former is just broken (hence this patch).  The latter is
kind of addressed by virtue of =E2=80=9CWriting happens in .prepare(), an=
d
parents come before children in the ReopenQueue=E2=80=9D.


OK, so you address one specific case of a dependency, namely of a node
on its bs->file when it comes to writableness.  Not too bad, supporting
bs->file as the only dependency makes sense.  Everything else would
become complicated.


Besides being more specific than the general solution I tried to sketch
above, there is one more difference, though: In that description, I said
we should remove the node and its dependencies from the ReopenQueue, and
commit it earlier.  That has three implicatons:

First, this patch reopens the file if it is not writable, but the parent
needs it to be writable.  I think that=E2=80=99s wrong.  We should take t=
he
file=E2=80=99s entry of the ReopenQueue and reopen it accordingly, not bl=
indly
reopen it RW.  (If the user didn=E2=80=99t specify the file to be reopene=
d RW,
that should be an error.)

Second, you need to take the dependencies into account.  (I don=E2=80=99t=
 know
whether this one is a problem in practice.)  If the file node itself has
a child that needs to be RW, then you need to take that from the
ReopenQueue, too, and repoen it RW, too.

Third, the reopen may require some other options on the file.
Temporarily reopening it RW without changing those options may not be
what the user wants.  (So another reason to take the existing
ReopenQueue entry.)


So -- without having tried, of course -- I think a better design would
be to look for bs->file->bs in the ReopenQueue, recursively all of its
children, and move all of those entries into a new queue, and then
invoke bdrv_reopen_multiple() on that one first.

The question then becomes how to roll back those changes...  I don=E2=80=99=
t
know whether just having bdrv_reopen() partially succeed is so bad.
Otherwise, we=E2=80=99d need a function to translate an existing node's s=
tate
into a BdrvReopenQueueEntry so we can thus return to the old state.

bdrv_child_try_set_perm() is dangerous, because its effect will be
undone whenever something happens that causes the permissions to be
refreshed.  (Hence the comment in block_int.h which says to avoid it.)
Generally, bdrv_child_refresh_perms() should be enough.  If it isn=E2=80=99=
t,
I=E2=80=99d say something=E2=80=99s off.
