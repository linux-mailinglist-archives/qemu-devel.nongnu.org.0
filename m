The increase in processes per-QEMU is a significant concern I have
around complexity & manageability in general, hence a desire to avoid
requiring processes unless they have a compelling reason to exist.

That applies to general use of DBus, but doesn't really apply to
the proposed QEMU usage, as every single helper is talking to the
same QEMU endpoint. So if we have 10 helpers, in p2p mode, we
get 10 sockets open between the helper & QEMU. In bus mode, we
get 10 sockets open between the helper & dbus and another socket
open between dbus & QEMU. The bus is only a win in connections
if you have a mesh-like connection topology not hub & spoke.

> - configuring/enforcing policies & limits

I don't see that as an advantage. Rather it is addressing the
decreased security that the bus model exposes. In peer2peer
mode, the helpers can only talk to QEMU, so can't directly
interact with each other. In bus mode, the helpers have a
direct communications path to attack each other over, so we
absolutely need policy to mitigate this increased risk. It
would be better to remove that risk at any architectural
level by not having a bus at all.

> - on-demand service activation & discoverability

Again useful for dbus in general, but I don't see any clear scenario
in which this is relevant to QEMU's usage.

As I said, I don't have any objection to DBus as a protocol. I think it
would serve our needs well, most especially because GIO has decent API
bindings to using it, so we avoid having to depend on another 3rd party
library for something else.

I think from QEMU's POV, the only real alternative to DBus would be to
build something on QMP. I prefer DBus, because JSON is a disaster for
integer type handling, and DBus is more accessible for the helper apps
which can easily use a DBus API of their choice.

As above I'm not seeing the compelling benefits of using a bus, so
think we shoud stick to dbus in p2p mode.
