Do you mean adding PropertyInfos for them?  Adding a once-only 
PropertyInfo is worse than writing a custom getter/setter pair, because:

- without (DEFINE_)PROP_* you lose the type safety.

- with (DEFINE_)PROP_* you have much more boilerplate to write

You're right, I'm a few years late.  So that objection is withdrawn.

That's a possibility too.  Though if we ever have a need for multiple 
allow_set functions it would be somewhat complicated to add it back.

Instead of class-wide allow_set, we might as well have a "bool 
constructed" field in Object and remove the function pointer altogether: 
just replace prop->allow_set(obj) with just "!obj->constructed".

Converting DEFINE_PROP_STRING to a schema also requires parsing C code, 
since you can have handwritten Property literals (especially for custom 
PropertyInfo).  Converting DEFINE_PROP_STRING it also requires matching 
the array against calls to object_class_add_field_properties (which 
could be hidden behind helpers such as device_class_set_props).  (Plus 
matching class_init functions against TypeInfo).

So, you don't save any parsing by using arrays.  (In fact I would 
probably skip the parsing, and use your suggestion of *executing* C 
code: write the QAPI schema generator in C, link into QEMU and run it 
just once to generate the QOM schema).

QOM has been using function calls for many years, are there any cases of 
misuse of that flexibility that you have in mind?  I can only think of 
two *uses*, in fact.  One is eepro100_register_types is the only case I 
can remember where types are registered dynamically.  The other is S390 
CPU features.  In fact,

   $ git grep \ object_class_property_add|grep -v '([a-z0-9_]*, \"'

shows some cases where property names are macros (an mst-ism :), but no 
other case where properties are being defined dynamically.
