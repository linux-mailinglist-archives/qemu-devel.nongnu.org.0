Correct.

I trust this works and makes sense, but the implicit conversions still
give me an uneasy feeling.

Testing:

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -nodefaults -display none -S -monitor stdio -smp 1,maxcpus=2
    QEMU 5.0.50 monitor - type 'help' for more information
    (qemu) cpu-add 1
    cpu_add is deprecated, please use device_add instead
    (qemu) cpu-add 1
    cpu_add is deprecated, please use device_add instead
    Error: CPU[1] with APIC ID 1 exists
    (qemu) 

We're good.

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu qemu64,enforce,topoext
    qemu-system-x86_64: warning: TCG doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.80000001H:ECX.topoext [bit 22]
    qemu-system-x86_64: TCG doesn't support requested features
    [Exit 1 ]

Are we good?

To finish the job in time for the freeze, I made do with this
non-assessment (commit 18d588fe1e1):

    To assess the bug's impact, we'd need to figure out how to make both
    calls fail.  Too much work for ignorant me, sorry.

Thanks!
