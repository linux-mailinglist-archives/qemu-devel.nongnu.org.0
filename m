So, here is what happens: your snapshot will contain garbage at places 
where it should contain zero.

This happens when your guest starts using an unpopulated page after 
snapshotting started and the page has not been copied to the snapshot 
yet. You won't get a WP event, therefore you cannot copy "zero" to the 
snapshot before content gets overridden.

If you load your snapshot, it contains garbage at places that are 
supposed to contain zero.


There is a feature in virtio-balloon that *depends* on previously 
discarded pages from staying unmodified in some cases: free page reporting.

The guest will report pages (that might have been initialized to zero) 
to the hypervisor). The hypervisor will discard page content if the 
content was initialized to zero. After that, the guest is free to reuse 
the pages anytime with the guarantee that content has not been modified 
(-> still is zero).


See QEMU hw/virtio/virtio-balloon.c: virtio_balloon_handle_report()

"When we discard the page it has the effect of removing the page from 
the hypervisor itself and causing it to be zeroed when it is returned to 
us. So we must not discard the page [...] if the guest is expecting it 
to retain a non-zero value."

And Linux drivers/virtio/virtio_balloon.c: virtballoon_validate()

"Inform the hypervisor that our pages are poisoned or initialized. If we 
cannot do that then we should disable page reporting as it could 
potentially change the contents of our free pages."


It's as simple as having a Linux guest with init_on_free and 
free-page-reporting active via virtio-balloon.

Long story short, your feature might break guests (when continuing the 
snapshot) when free page reporting is active. I agree that MISSING 
events might be too heavy, so you should disable snapshots if free page 
reporting is active.
