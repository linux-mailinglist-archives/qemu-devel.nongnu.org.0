For raw definitely yes, because raw doesn't have backing files, so the
code will never run.

For qcow2, block_resize can already block for a relatively long time
while metadata tables are resized, clusters are discarded etc. I just
don't really see the difference in quality between that and allocating
some zero clusters in a corner case like having a short overlay.

Would you feel more comfortable if we set BDRV_REQ_NO_FALLBACK and
return an error if we can't zero out the area? We would have to
advertise that flag in bs->supported_zero_flags for qcow2 then (but
probably we should do that anyway?)

That the behaviour is wrong.

For commit it's an image corruptor. For resize, I'll admit that it's
just wrong behaviour that is probably harmless in most cases, but it's
still wrong behaviour. It would be a corruptor in the same way as commit
if it allowed resizing intermediate nodes, but I _think_ the old-style
op blockers still forbid this. We'd have to double-check this if we
leave things broken for block_resize.

Anyway, so are you suggesting adding another parameter to
bdrv_co_truncate() that enables wrong, but quicker semantics, and that
would only be used by block_resize?

Kevin
