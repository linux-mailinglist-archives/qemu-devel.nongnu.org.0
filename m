There are a couple of wrinkles. As far as NaN and denormal behaviour
goes we have enough slack in the spec that different guests have
slightly different behaviour. See pickNaN and friends in the soft float
specialisation code. As a result we never try and hand off to hardfloat
for NaNs, Infs and Zeros. Luckily testing for those cases if a fairly
small part of the cost of the calculation.

Also things tend to get unstuck on changes to rounding modes.
Fortunately it doesn't seem to be supper common.=20

You can read even more detail in the paper that originally prompted
Emilio's work:

  "supporting the neon and VFP instruction sets in an LLVM-based
   binary translator"
   https://www.thinkmind.org/download.php?articleid=3Dicas_2015_5_20_20033

One of my original patches did just this:

  Subject: [PATCH] fpu/softfloat: use hardware sqrt if we can (EXPERIMENT!)
  Date: Tue, 20 Feb 2018 21:01:37 +0000
  Message-Id: <20180220210137.18018-1-alex.bennee@linaro.org>

The two problems you run into are:

 - relying on a trap for inexact will be slow if you keep hitting it
 - reading host FPU flag registers turns out to be pretty expensive
