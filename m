The other thing to keep in mind is that the poison value only really
comes into play with hinting/reporting. In the case of the standard
balloon the pages are considered allocated from the guest's
perspective until the balloon is deflated. Then any poison/init will
occur over again anyway so I don't think the standard balloon should
really care.

For hinting it somewhat depends. Currently the implementation is
inflating a balloon so having poisoning or init_on_free means it is
written to immediately after it is freed so it defeats the purpose of
the hinting. However that is a Linux implementation issue, not
necessarily an issue with the QEMU implementation. As such may be I
should fix that in the Linux driver since that has been ignored in
QEMU up until now anyway. The more interesting bit is what should the
behavior be from the hypervisor when a page is marked as being hinted.
I think right now the behavior is to just not migrate the page. I
wonder though if we shouldn't instead just consider the page a zero
page, and then maybe modify the zero page behavior for the case where
we know page poisoning is enabled.

For reporting it is a matter of tracking the contents. We don't want
to modify the contents in any way as we are attempting to essentially
do in-place tracking of the page. So if it is poisoned or initialized
it needs to stay in that state so we cannot invalidate the page if
doing so will cause it to lose state information.

I believe that is the current behavior. Essentially if poisoning
enabled then the feature flag is left set. I think the one change I
will make in the driver is that if poisoning is enabled in the kernel,
but PAGE_POISON is not available as a feature, I am going to disable
both the reporting and hinting features in virtballoon_validate.

I already have a patch for that.

The bigger issue is how to deal with the PAGE_POISON being enabled
with FREE_PAGE_HINTING. The legacy code at this point is just broken
and is plowing through with FREE_PAGE_HINTING while it is enabled.
That is safe for now because it is using a balloon, the side effect is
that it is going to defer migration. If it switches to a page
reporting type setup at some point in the future we would need to make
sure something is written to the other end to identify the poison/zero
pages.
