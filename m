I think it'd be interesting to be able to repeat those tests in a
different environment. I ran multiple benchmarks in the past comparing
vhost-user-blk (Rust) vs. qemu/contrib/vhost-user-blk (C) and
vhost-user-fs (Rust) vs virtiofsd (C) and never found that performance
hit.

Much on contrary, I found Rust's zero-cost abstractions promise to
live up even with very idiomatic chunks of code (such as
vm-virtio::Queue).

Sounds good. What kind of help would you need?

Thanks!
