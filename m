Hmm, yeah. Something is going on at least. It's not really clear to me
why it works or what is happening with that admin completion queue
timer, but I'll dig through it.

No, its a string of series that all has a Based-on tag (that is, "[PATCH
0/3] hw/block/nvme: bump to v1.4" has another Based-on tag that points
to the dependency of that). The point was to have patchew nicely apply
everything, but it broke midway...

As Philippe pointed out, all of the patch sets are integrated in the
GitHub tree, applied to QEMU master.

Well, thanks! :)

Yeah this stuff has been around for a while so the history on patchwork
is a mess.

Sure, but it's nicer in combination with the previous series
("hw/block/nvme: AIO and address mapping refactoring"). What I /can/ do
is rip out "hw/block/nvme: allow multiple aios per command" as that
patch might require more time for reviews. The rest of that series are
clean ups and a couple of bug fixes.

Yes that and reviewers requested a lot of separation, so basically the
patch set ballooned.

Yeah, as I mentioned in my cover letter, I was on leave, so I wasn't
around for the big ZNS release day either. But, honestly, I think this
is irrelevant - code should be merged based on technical reasons (not
technicalities).

Blowing my own horn here, but yeah, it seems like everyone would like to
see this merged.

Looks like the two version are pretty much on par in terms of features.

As stated above I think its only a single commit ("hw/block/nvme: allow
multiple aios per command") that is controversial in that series.

Absolutely - I totally get that you want to move forward with Dmitry's
series, but I'd like to finish my review before committing to anything.
