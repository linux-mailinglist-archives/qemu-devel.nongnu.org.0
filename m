Public bug reported:

When running a machine using "-vnc" and the "websocket" option QEMU
seems to require the subprotocol called 'binary'. This subprotocol does
not exist in the WebSocket specification. In fact it has never existed
in the spec, in one of the very early drafts of WebSockets it was
briefly mentioned but it never made it to a final version.

When the WebSocket server requires a non-standard subprotocol any
WebSocket client that works correctly won't be able to connect.

One example of such a client is noVNC, it tells the server that it
doesn't want to use any subprotocol. QEMU's WebSocket proxy doesn't let
noVNC connect. If noVNC is modified to ask for 'binary' it will work,
this is, however, incorrect behavior.

Looking at the code in "io/channel-websock.c" it seems it's quite hard-
coded to binary:

Look at line 58 and 433 here:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dio/channel-websock.c

This code has to be made more dynamic, and shouldn't require binary.
