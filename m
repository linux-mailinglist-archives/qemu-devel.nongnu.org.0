ok, I will do that in the future.

In any case, the style problems found by patchew for the last version of=20
the patch I have submitted are for a fragment of a file copied verbatim=20
from the NetBSD source code (in the same way the equivalent fragment was=20
copied from OpenBSD when support for that OS was added). It is mostly=20
the copyright header and a few defines. IMO, style shouldn't be=20
corrected there.

Hi,

This series seems to have some coding style problems. See output below fo=

Salvador,

you can use scripts/checkpatch.pl in the QEMU directory to check your
patch for style before sending them.

And don't send them as a reply but as a new thread, using versioning in
the subject ("[PATCH v4]").
