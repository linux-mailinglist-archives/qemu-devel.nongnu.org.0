Title:
  xv6 Bootloop

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Qemu Version: 4.2.0

  Launch command:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -drive file=3Dfs.img,index=3D1,media=3Ddisk=
,format=3Draw -drive file=3Dxv6.img,index=3D0,media=3Ddisk,format=3Draw -sm=
p 2 -m 512

  How to reproduce?
  1.)  Use/install latest release of qemu (4.2.0 at time of writing)

  2.)  Download, build, and run xv6 (a simple os designed for learning
  operating systems fundamentals)

  cd /tmp
  git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git
  cd xv6-public
  make qemu-nox

  3.)  Qemu should now bootloop (seem to try to boot but then just
  repeat). This is what it looks like below before it repeats:

  SeaBIOS (version ?-20191223_100556-anatol)

  iPXE (http://ipxe.org) 00:03.0 CA00 PCI2.10 PnP PMM+1FF92A50+1FEF2A50
  CA00

  Booting from Hard Disk..

  Host: Arch Linux - Kernel version: 5.4.13
  Guest: xv6 (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)

  Suspicion:

  When I was using qemu 2.11.1 inside an ubuntu docker container, the
  xv6 os booted with no problem. I am thinking that something changed
  between Qemu 2.11.1 and Qemu 4.2.0 which is now causing boot problems.
