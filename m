I think doing forwarding at higher layer have the following issues:

- Need a dedicated library (probably libbpf) but application may choose=20
to do eBPF syscall directly
- Depends on guest agent to work
- Can't work for virtio-net hardware, since it still requires a hardware=20
interface for carrying=C2=A0 offloading information
- Implement at the level of kernel may help for future extension like=20
BPF object pinning and eBPF helper etc.

Basically, this series is trying to have an implementation of=20
transporting eBPF through virtio, so it's not necessarily a guest to=20
host but driver and device. For device, it could be either a virtual one=20
(as done in qemu) or a real hardware.

My understanding is that it should not be much difference compared to=20
other offloading technology.

We've considered such way, but actual machine code is not as portable as=20
eBPF bytecode consider we may want:

- Support migration
- Further offload the program to smart NIC (e.g through macvtap=20
passthrough mode etc).
