My guess is that it's just a lot of code that has to run. :(

No, you're not a pain, you're explaining your reasoning and that helps.

To me *maintainability is the biggest consideration* when introducing a
new feature.  "We can do just as well with q35" is a good reason to
deprecate and delete microvm, but not a good reason to reject it now as
long as microvm is good enough in terms of maintainability.  Keeping it
out of tree only makes it harder to do this kind of experiment.  virtio
1 seems to be the biggest remaining blocker and I think it'd be a good
thing to have even for the ARM virt machine type.

FWIW the "PCI tax" seems to be ~10 ms in QEMU, ~10 ms in the firmware(*)
and ~25 ms in the kernel.  I must say that's pretty good, but it's still
30% of the whole boot time and reducing it is the hardest part.  If
having microvm in tree can help reducing it, good.  Yes, it will get
users, but most likely they will have to support pc or q35 as a fallback
so we could still delete microvm at any time with the due deprecation
period if it turns out to be a failed experiment.

Whether to use qboot or SeaBIOS for microvm is another story, but it's
an implementation detail as long as the ROM size doesn't change and/or
we don't do versioned machine types.  So we can switch from one to the
other at any time; we can also include qboot directly in QEMU's tree,
without going through a submodule, which also reduces the infrastructure
needed (mirrors, etc.) and makes it easier to delete it.

(*) I measured 15ms in SeaBIOS and 5ms in qboot from the first to the
last write to 0xcf8.  I suspect part of qboot's 10ms boot time actually
end up measured as PCI in SeaBIOS, due to different init order, so the
real firmware cost of PAM and PCI initialization should be 5ms for qboot
and 10ms for SeaBIOS.
