Then the commit message should state that. How about:

All callers of nbd_iter_channel_error() pass the address of a local_err=20
variable, and only call this function if an error has already occurred,=20
using this function to append details to that error.  This is already=20
implied by its name (local_err instead of the classic errp), but it is=20
worth additionally stressing this by adding an assertion to make it part=20
of the function contract.

With an improved commit message, the assertion makes sense, so

No, that's not worth it.
