There's more than one way to encode integers as a list of 53 bit signed
integers.  Any of them will do, we just have to specify one.

Picking option 3 is no excuse for complicating matters further.  QMP is
primarily for machines.  So my first choice would be to keep everything
decimal.  I could be persuaded to have QEMU parse integers from strings
with base 0, i.e. leading 0x gets you hex, leading 0 gets you octal.
