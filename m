That is definitely better than just probing. In my opinion though the
format should always be specified explicitly. No favorism of 'raw' or
any other format. In libvirt we fill-in that the format of the image is
'raw' unless the user specifies something else rather than reporting an
error. This causes continuous grief for users who forget to set the
format. (one example is that if you create a fully-allocated qcow2 image
but use it as raw and install your VM, you'll never notice until you
want to use qcow2 features. Users usually notice once they try to create
a sparse image though due to the size difference)
