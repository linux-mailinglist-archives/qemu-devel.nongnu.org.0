Permanent, it is a feature.

mypy intentionally supports gradual typing as a paradigm: it allows you 
to intermix "typed" and "untyped" functions.

```
def __init__(self):
     pass
```

Happens to pass as both untyped and fully typed. In order to distinguish 
it in this one case, you must add the return annotation as a declaration 
of intent.

However, when using '--strict' mode, you are declaring your intent to 
mypy that everything MUST be strictly typed, so perhaps in this case it 
would be possible to omit the annotation for __init__.

So maybe someday this will change; but given how uncommon it is to write 
no-argument init methods, I am hardly bothered by it. Mypy will remind 
you if you forget.
