Yes and no.

You could still keep using the same abstraction that libvirt has always
used while doing this. What my imaginary newly written management
library would do differently isn't necessarily the interface between
libvirt and applications, but getting rid of backwards compatibility
requirements in the interface between QEMU and libvirt.

But of course, blockdev isn't even a feature per se. It's getting the
abstraction right so that it's actually abstract enough to represent
everything. As long as libvirt keeps using an abstraction that is based
on simplistic setups, it won't be able to expose the full feature set of
QEMU. This is less than satisfying. In the long run, libvirt will have
to extend its abstraction to make full use of new features either way.

I think this would be too much indeed.

Someone has to do this anyway. Note that here I'm still talking about
the hypothetical case where no libvirt existed yet.

If we cared only about OpenStack, oVirt and friends, this would still
all be QEMU-based, so not a big problem to have it tied to QEMU.

I'm not sure what this looks like in practice in libvirt: Are these
components shared between multiple hypervisor interfaces or is it only
for QEMU anyway?

If multiple hypervisors make use of it, how crazy would it be to imagine
reversing which project consumes which? Instead of having the libvirt
core consume the hypervisor-specific sublibraries, could a QEMU-specific
part live closer to QEMU and consume the libvirt core as an external
library?

I guess much of what I write in this thread is pure heresy. :-)
Maybe most of it isn't even useful. But maybe there is an idea or two in
it that are worth having a closer look at.

I would imagine so, because the problem doesn't become visible in the
daily work, but only in the bigger picture: The other hypervisors are
what prevent libvirt from being more tightly intergrated with QEMU.

This means that there is a boundary between QEMU and libvirt that makes
it really slow to get new features to the user. And both QEMU and
libvirt waste a lot of time for maintaining backwards compatibility in
things that wouldn't necessarily have to be stable interfaces if the
management library were developed in lockstep with QEMU.

Time spent on non-QEMU isn't really my concern. Time spent maintaining
stable interface between QEMU and libvirt, and time spent waiting for
QEMU releases before libvirt development starts are my concern.
