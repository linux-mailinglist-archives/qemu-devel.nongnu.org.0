For QEMU, it's built from mainline.
For GDB, I have tried 8.1 and latest 9.1.

hmm, On my side, this is 100% reproducable on arm32, but aarch64 doesn't. I
think the GDB has different assumptions for different arch.

This is also 100% reproducable for my tested elf guest. But so sorry that I
can't share it. Probablly I will check this issue some days later.
