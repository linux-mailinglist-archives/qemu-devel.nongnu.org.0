OK that's interesting - I've got another bug I've been following that's
also fixed by (b).

A bisect would still be interesting; but one place to start might be to try=
 before and after commit =

Title:
  Regression: QEMU 4.1.0 qxl and KMS resoluiton only 4x10

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Host is Arch Linux.  linux 5.2.13, qemu 4.1.0.  virt-viewer 8.0.

  Guest is Arch Linux Sept 2019 ISO.  linux 5.2.11.

  Have replicated this both on a system using amdgpu and one using
  integrated ASPEED graphics.

  Downgrading from 4.1.0 to 4.0.0 works as usual, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DNyMdcYwOCvY

  Going back to 4.1.0 reproduces, see:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DH3nGG2Mk6i0

  4.1.0 displays fine until KMS kicks in.

  Using 4.1.0 with virtio-vga doesn't cause this.
