Yes, it is definitely worth having the exact number of guest instructions!

Ahmed and I knew from the outset, like everybody else for that matter, that
workload and guest compiler and architecture itself immensly impact any
measurement.

However, if we keep the same guest, guest compiler, and workload as well,
and change just qemu, than we should be able to draw conclusion on
qemu-specific issues, and hopefully remove some inefficiencies. I hope you
will see that approach in next Ahmed's reports.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Mr. Alex,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve created a plugins build as you&#39;ve said using &qu=
ot;--enable-plugins&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt; option.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve searched for &quot;libinsn.so&quot; plugin that you&=
#39;ve mentioned in your<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; command but it isn&#39;t in that path.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; make plugins<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; and you should find them in tests/plugins/<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi, both Alex and Ahmed,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ahmed showed me tonight the first results with number of guest<br>
&gt; instructions. It was almost eye-opening to me. The thing is, by now, I=
 had<br>
&gt; only vague picture that, on average, &quot;many&quot; host instruction=
s are generated<br>
&gt; per one guest instruction. Now, I could see exact ratio for each targe=
t,<br>
&gt; for a particular example.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A question for Alex:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - What would be the application of this new info? (Except that one has=
 nice<br>
&gt; feeling, like I do, of knowing the exact ratio host/guest instruction =
for a<br>
&gt; particular scenario.)<br>
<br>

<br>
&gt; I just have a feeling there is more significance of this new data that=
