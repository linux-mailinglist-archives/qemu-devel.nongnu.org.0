Paolo,

While debugging hungs in ARM64 while doing a simple:

qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 file.qcow2 output.qcow2

I might have found 2 issues which I'd like you to review, if possible.

ISSUE #1
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I've caught the following stack trace after an HUNG in qemu-img convert:

(gdb) bt
#0 syscall ()
#1 0x0000aaaaaabd41cc in qemu_futex_wait
#2 qemu_event_wait (ev=3Dev@entry=3D0xaaaaaac86ce8 <rcu_call_ready_event>)
#3 0x0000aaaaaabed05c in call_rcu_thread
#4 0x0000aaaaaabd34c8 in qemu_thread_start
#5 0x0000ffffbf25c880 in start_thread
#6 0x0000ffffbf1b6b9c in thread_start ()

(gdb) print rcu_call_ready_event
$4 =3D {value =3D 4294967295, initialized =3D true}

value INT_MAX (4294967295) seems WRONG for qemu_futex_wait():

- EV_BUSY, being -1, and passed as an argument qemu_futex_wait(void *,
unsigned), is a two's complement, making argument into a INT_MAX when
that's not what is expected (unless I missed something).

*** If that is the case, unsure if you, Paolo, prefer declaring
*(QemuEvent)->value as an integer or changing EV_BUSY to "2" would okay
here ***

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ISSUE #2
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I found this when debugging lockups while in futex() in a specific ARM64
server - https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1805256 - which I'm still
investigating.

After fixing the issue above, I'm still getting stuck into:

qemu_event_wait() -> qemu_futex_wait()

***
As if qemu_event_set() has ran before qemu_futex_wait() ever started running
***

The Other threads are waiting for poll() on a PIPE coming from this
stuck thread (thread #1), and in sigwait():

(gdb) thread 1

#3  0x0000aaaaaabd0764 in os_host_main_loop_wait
#4  main_loop_wait

#4 0x0000aaaaaabd34c8 in qemu_thread_start
#5 0x0000ffffbf25c880 in start_thread
#6 0x0000ffffbf1b6b9c in thread_start ()

(gdb) thread 3

(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000ffffbf11aa20 in __GI___sigtimedwait
#1  0x0000ffffbf2671b4 in __sigwait

#3  0x0000aaaaaabd34c8 in qemu_thread_start
#4  0x0000ffffbf25c880 in start_thread
#5  0x0000ffffbf1b6b9c in thread_start

QUESTION:

- Should qemu_event_set() check return code from
qemu_futex_wake()->qemu_futex()->syscall() in order to know if ANY
waiter was ever woken up ? Maybe even loop until at least 1 is awaken ?

Tks in advance,

Rafael D. Tinoco

Title:
  qemu-img hangs on rcu_call_ready_event logic in Aarch64 when
  converting images

Status in QEMU:
  In Progress
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  On the HiSilicon D06 system - a 96 core NUMA arm64 box - qemu-img
  frequently hangs (~50% of the time) with this command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 /tmp/cloudimg /tmp/cloudimg2

  Where "cloudimg" is a standard qcow2 Ubuntu cloud image. This
  qcow2->qcow2 conversion happens to be something uvtool does every time
  it fetches images.

  Once hung, attaching gdb gives the following backtrace:
