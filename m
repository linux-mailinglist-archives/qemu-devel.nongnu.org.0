We can use empty string (like the default export name), so the bitmap
would be exposed as:

    "qemu:dirty-bitmap:"

This would solve the issue for users, and keep the API extensible.

But using the bitmap name means user of the NBD server need to know this na=
me.

One option is that libvirt would publish the name of the bitmap in the
xml describing
the backup, and oVirt will have to propagate this name to the actual
program accessing
the NBD server, which may be a user program in the case when we expose the =
NBD
URL to users (planned for future version).

Another option is that the user will control this name, and libvirt
will use the name specified
by the user. This means oVirt will have to provide API to set this
name and pass it to libvirt.

Both cases require lot of effort which does not help anyone in the
task of getting dirty
extents from an image - which is our current goal. We need to have
good defaults that
save unneeded effort in the entire stack.

I don't think this is about correctness, but having better default for user=
s.
