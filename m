Wow, confusing to the max.

Opps.

Definitely

In libvirt we use libcap-ng. We picked this originally as its API
design allows you do write simpler code than libcap in some cases
You can see some docs & examples here:

  https://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/libcap-ng/

So I vote for changing the 9p code to use libcap-ng.

>   z) We should probably add the other one to the ci.

Yep.
