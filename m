I too got confused after reading your comment.
Lets walk through the device states and transitions can happen here:

if running
  - device state could be either _SAVING or _RESUMING or _STOP. Both 
_SAVING and _RESUMING can't be set at a time, that is the error state. 
_STOP means 0.
  - Transition from _SAVING to _RUNNING can happen if there is migration 
failure, in that case we have to clear _SAVING
- Transition from _RESUMING to _RUNNING can happen on resuming and we 
have to clear _RESUMING.
- In both the above cases, we have to set _RUNNING and clear rest 2 bits.
Then:
mask = ~VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_MASK;
value = VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_RUNNING;

if !running
- device state could be either _RUNNING or _SAVING|_RUNNING. Here we 
have to reset running bit.
Then:
mask = ~VFIO_DEVICE_STATE_RUNNING;
value = 0;

I'll add comment in the code above.

I think it doesn't indicate which device caused problem but it sets 
error on migration stream
