Works for me. At the lowest layer it is a hint.

True.

This is one of 3 that local_error (commit
006e9d3618698eeef2f3e07628d22cb6f5c2a039) - intentionally just a
warning and to TLDR the commit/Suraj conversation; defaults apply
to all machine types; hardware security measures don't make sense in
TCG; hence warning.

For every function with CAPABILITY_[ERROR|HINT] its called by
spapr_caps_apply, has its errp as &error_fatal (intentionally - spoke
to Suraj - migrations to machines without capabilities need to fail and
defaults (kvm) should be secure unless explicitly disabled).

Ok.
 
> Not sure why it isn't used here but it should be something like:

If error_append_hint should be used for fatal errors (all that use
errp), then this patten should be applied further to
CAPABILITY_[HINT|ERROR] functions.

If error_append_hint needs to apply to warnings
cap_[cfpc/sbbc/ibs]_apply functions need to use it.

Would I be right in I'm assuming that the below pattern needs to apply
to both of these cases?

This is going a little beyond the scope of fixing a message, ok, but
lets not extend the scope too much more.
