This is not how I recall the discussion. The reason we decided to
soften this patche's warning was because there was a sizeable
contingent of people who said "I want the basic './configure; make'
commands to keep working and am willing to write the wrapper
makefile that wil cause those to automatically create and use
a build directory under the hood". If the commands will keep working
then there's nothing to deprecate.

("Stuff doesn't currently work with out-of-tree builds" is something
that I argued at that point in the thread was definitely not a reason
not to deprecate.)

And Meson is the other part of this -- if Meson is coming soon-ish
and will mean users having to change their build commands in some
way anyway, it's better for them if we only make them change once,
when Meson arrives, rather than once now and then again later.

My understanding of the consensus position was "we should stop
supporting in-tree build in the main makefile machinery but should
have a trivial wrapper that creates and uses a build directory
under the hood if the user does run configure/make from the
source tree". I think that should be much less painful to maintain
than handling both setups through the whole of our makefile system.
(I wouldn't personally bother to implement it, but several people
volunteered to do so.)
