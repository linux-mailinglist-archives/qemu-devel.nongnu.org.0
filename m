-Introduction
-------------
+A TCG *basic block* is a single entry, multiple exit region which
+corresponds to a list of instructions terminated by a label, or
+any branch instruction.
 
-TCG instructions operate on variables which are temporaries, local
-temporaries or globals. TCG instructions and variables are strongly
-typed. Two types are supported: 32 bit integers and 64 bit
-integers. Pointers are defined as an alias to 32 bit or 64 bit
-integers depending on the TCG target word size.
+A TCG *extended basic block* is a single entry, multiple exit region
+which corresponds to a list of instructions terminated by a label or
+an unconditional branch.  Specifically, an extended basic block is
+a sequence of basic blocks connected by the fall-through paths of
+zero or more conditional branch instructions.
 
-Each instruction has a fixed number of output variable operands, input
-variable operands and always constant operands.
+Operations

-The notable exception is the call instruction which has a variable

+TCG instructions or *ops* operate on TCG *variables*, both of which

+Variables
+=========
 
-Assumptions
------------
+* ``TEMP_FIXED``
 
-Basic blocks
-^^^^^^^^^^^^
+  There is one TCG *fixed global* variable, ``cpu_env``, which is
+  live in all translation blocks, and holds a pointer to ``CPUArchState``.
+  This variable is held in a host cpu register at all times in all
+  translation blocks.
 
-* Basic blocks end after branches (e.g. brcond_i32 instruction),
-  goto_tb and exit_tb instructions.
+* ``TEMP_GLOBAL``
 
-* Basic blocks start after the end of a previous basic block, or at a
-  set_label instruction.
+  A TCG *global* is a variable which is live in all translation blocks,
+  and corresponds to memory location that is within ``CPUArchState``.
+  These may be specified as an offset from ``cpu_env``, in which case
+  they are called *direct globals*, or may be specified as an offset
+  from a direct global, in which case they are called *indirect globals*.
+  Even indirect globals should still reference memory within
+  ``CPUArchState``.  All TCG globals are defined during
+  ``TCGCPUOps.initialize``, before any translation blocks are generated.
 
-After the end of a basic block, the content of temporaries is
-destroyed, but local temporaries and globals are preserved.
+* ``TEMP_CONST``
 
-Floating point types
-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+  A TCG *constant* is a variable which is live throughout the entire
+  translation block, and contains a constant value.  These variables
+  are allocated on demand during translation and are hashed so that
+  there is exactly one variable holding a given value.
 
-* Floating point types are not supported yet
+* ``TEMP_TB``
 
-Pointers
-^^^^^^^^
+  A TCG *translation block temporary* is a variable which is live
+  throughout the entire translation block, but dies on any exit.
+  These temporaries are allocated explicitly during translation.
 
-* Depending on the TCG target, pointer size is 32 bit or 64
-  bit. The type ``TCG_TYPE_PTR`` is an alias to ``TCG_TYPE_I32`` or
-  ``TCG_TYPE_I64``.
+* ``TEMP_EBB``
+
+  A TCG *extended basic block temporary* is a variable which is live
+  throughout an extended basic block, but dies on any exit.
+  These temporaries are allocated explicitly during translation.
+
+Types
+=====
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_I32``
+
+  A 32-bit integer.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_I64``
+
+  A 64-bit integer.  For 32-bit hosts, such variables are split into a pair
+  of variables with ``type=TCG_TYPE_I32`` and ``base_type=TCG_TYPE_I64``.
+  The ``temp_subindex`` for each indicates where it falls within the
+  host-endian representation.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_PTR``
+
+  An alias for ``TCG_TYPE_I32`` or ``TCG_TYPE_I64``, depending on the size
+  of a pointer for the host.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_REG``
+
+  An alias for ``TCG_TYPE_I32`` or ``TCG_TYPE_I64``, depending on the size
+  of the integer registers for the host.  This may be larger
+  than ``TCG_TYPE_PTR`` depending on the host ABI.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_I128``
+
+  A 128-bit integer.  For all hosts, such variables are split into a number
+  of variables with ``type=TCG_TYPE_REG`` and ``base_type=TCG_TYPE_I128``.
+  The ``temp_subindex`` for each indicates where it falls within the
+  host-endian representation.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_V64``
+
+  A 64-bit vector.  This type is valid only if the TCG target
+  sets ``TCG_TARGET_HAS_v64``.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_V128``
+
+  A 128-bit vector.  This type is valid only if the TCG target
+  sets ``TCG_TARGET_HAS_v128``.
+
+* ``TCG_TYPE_V256``
+
+  A 256-bit vector.  This type is valid only if the TCG target
+  sets ``TCG_TARGET_HAS_v256``.
 
 Helpers
-^^^^^^^
+=======
 
-* Using the tcg_gen_helper_x_y it is possible to call any function
-  taking i32, i64 or pointer types. By default, before calling a helper,
-  all globals are stored at their canonical location and it is assumed
-  that the function can modify them. By default, the helper is allowed to
-  modify the CPU state or raise an exception.
+Helpers are registered in a guest-specific ``helper.h``,
+which is processed to generate ``tcg_gen_helper_*`` functions.
+With these functions it is possible to call a function taking
+i32, i64, i128 or pointer types.

+By default, before calling a helper, all globals are stored at their

+following function modifiers:
 
-  - ``TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS`` means that the helper does not read globals,
-    either directly or via an exception. They will not be saved to their
-    canonical locations before calling the helper.
+* ``TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS``
 
-  - ``TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS`` means that the helper does not modify any globals.
-    They will only be saved to their canonical location before calling helpers,
-    but they won't be reloaded afterwards.
+  The helper does not modify any globals, but may read them.
+  Globals will be saved to their canonical location before calling helpers,
+  but need not be reloaded afterwards.
 
-  - ``TCG_CALL_NO_SIDE_EFFECTS`` means that the call to the function is removed if
-    the return value is not used.
+* ``TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS``
 
-  Note that ``TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS`` implies ``TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS``.
+  The helper does not read globals, either directly or via an exception.
+  They will not be saved to their canonical locations before calling
+  the helper.  This implies ``TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS``.
 
-  On some TCG targets (e.g. x86), several calling conventions are
-  supported.
+* ``TCG_CALL_NO_SIDE_EFFECTS``
 
-Branches
-^^^^^^^^
-
-* Use the instruction 'br' to jump to a label.
+  The call to the helper function may be removed if the return value is
+  not used.  This means that it may not modify any CPU state nor may it
+  raise an exception.
