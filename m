How could the manage tool figure out that 1/2 of pdev1 is equivalent=20
to 1/4 of pdev2? If we really want to allow such thing happen, the best
choice is to report the same mdev type on both pdev1 and pdev2.

btw mdev<->phys just brings trouble to upper stack as Alex pointed out.=20
Can we simplify the requirement by allowing only mdev<->mdev and=20
phys<->phys migration? If an customer does want to migrate between a=20
mdev and phys, he could wrap physical device into a wrapped mdev=20
instance (with the same type as the source mdev) instead of using vendor=20
ops. Doing so does add some burden but if mdev<->phys is not dominant=20
usage then such tradeoff might be worthywhile...

Thanks
