No: "a client can use code generated for a specific version of QMP" does
not imply versioning on the client side.  It does imply that, before
using *certain* features, the client must verify that they are
implemented in the server.

And builders in Rust, or keyword arguments in Python, are perfectly
idiomatic.

Great.  Do you have ideas around how to design good QMP commands?  It
doesn't have to be patches for code, just documentation.

I played a bit with varlink, and it seems to me that varlink does
actually support QMP-/OpenAPI-like extensibility.  Missing nullable
fields are treated as null, and on the client side it generally does not
give an error if it receives unknown fields (just like QMP). [1]  Also
just like QMP there are limits to the server's liberality, for example
sending extra fields to the server is an error.

In fact I could have skipped the experiments and read the Varlink
documentation: :)

  Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a
  feature set described in detail by the interface definition, which is
  part of the wire protocol.

  If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only
  extend it, never remove or incompatibly change things which might be
  already in use.

  [...]

  Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in
  its interface definition or on the wire, all parameters are identified
  by their name and can be extended later.

  Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields
  (nullable type, maybe). The result of the methods, when passed
  parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
  versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected
  behavior for omitted fields/parameters should be documented. Removing
  fields, types, errors or methods are not backward compatible and
  should be avoided.

which is pretty much what QMP does.  So even though some users of
varlink might have chosen to rein themselves in on the extensibility
allowed by Varlink, that's a self-imposed limitation.  It may be due to
the desire to interoperate with varlink language bindings that use
positional parameters, but that's again a limitation of the bindings and
not the protocol.

So I don't see varlink as a reason to change the existing practice for
QMP, more as a second example of someone else doing the same as QMP.

Again, I'm not saying that DBus's choice with respect to versioning and
backwards/forwards-compatibility is _wrong_.  I do not like Protobuf's
numbered fields for that matter either, but it's not wrong either.  I am
saying that the choices in QMP are one of many different tradeoffs, and
that there's no point in saying that they get in the way of writing
language bindings or even just in the way of writing good/idiomatic
language bindings, because they don't.

[1] Try this:

$ git clone git://github.com/bonzini/python
$ git checkout nullable-ping
$ python3 -m varlink.tests.test_orgexamplemore --varlink="unix:/tmp/test" &

And then:

$ varlink info unix:/tmp/test org.example.more
...
method Ping(ping: ?string) -> (pong: ?string)
...
$ python -m varlink.cli call unix:/tmp/test/org.example.more.Ping '{}'
{
  "pang": "xxx",
  "pong": null
}

You can see that the argument was implicitly treated as null, and there
were no complaints about the extra returned field.

I didn't try returning extra fields with the Rust bindings, but I did
try optional arguments and they work fine.  A "recent" client with
optional argument can talk to an "old" server with non-optional
argument, and it will only fail if the client actually takes advantage
of the newer interface.  As long as the argument is there, everything
works just fine.
