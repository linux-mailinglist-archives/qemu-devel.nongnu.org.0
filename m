I found that C:\Program Files (x86)\SPICE Guest
Tools\drivers\Balloon\w10\amd64/blnsvr.exe intensively requesting
something in WMI-provider-host. And there are a lot of errors in event
logs about it also.

  After upgrading Windows 10 guest to version 1803, guests VM runs
  slower and there is high host CPU load even when guest is almost idle.
  Did not happened with windows 10 up to version 1709.

  See my 1st report here:

  Tested on: Ubuntu 16.04 with qemu 2.5.0 and i3-3217U, Arch with qemu
  2.12 i5-7200U, Ubuntu 18.04 qemu 2.11.1 AMD FX-4300. All three
