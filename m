I think the downsides comapred here are rather different orders of
magnitude. The checkpatch.pl script is 3000 lines of code where we
have years of experiance that no one in QEMU likes touching it.

The makefile here is 265 lines of which 50% is comments of license
text.  In terms of what contributors most care about though, is
how you add new rules, and most of the time that's involves just
adding a 3 line make rule based off a regex to match the code
pattern you want to prohibit. Some of this is a bit crufty to
look at, but we've got years of experiance in libvirt with many
contributors frequently adding new tests.

It only gets hairy if the pattern you're trying to forbid needs
to match across multiple lines of text - hence the difference in
complexity between matching 'osdep.h' exists in .c, vs 'osdep.h'
exists as the very first #include.  IME, the single-line matches
are most typical need that is addressed.

So while I wont claim this proposal is perfect, IMHO this would
be a significant step fowards over checkpatch.pl.

With regards,
Daniel
