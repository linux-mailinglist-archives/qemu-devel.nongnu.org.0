well, that's the problem, I have no idea at all what I want; and "I"
doesn't really apply completely in this situation, as the call to run
qemu comes from deep inside a test suite, and can run on multiple
archs, and could even be run by other people on other systems/archs.

This is what I have (tentatively) come up with to handle this in the test s=
uite:
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/13409/files#diff-2ea30ffea3b108e0f9=
c50846cfdcd4e5R197

To be fair, it's unlikely that other people would run this on an arm
system, unless they were a bit more familiar with arm, and maybe would
know what machine type to pick.  Similarly for the testbeds that I
handle for this test suite, I know that 'virt' seems to work.

I am certainly not the right person to pick what the default should
be, but I do think there should be *some* default.  If 'virt' is the
most popular and/or has the widest kernel support, then it probably
makes sense to make that the default.

I would guess that users of qemu-system-aarch64 (or -arm) fall into 2 group=
s:

1. people who know about arm and know exactly what machine they want to use
2. people who don't know about arm and have no idea what machine to use

group #1 of course can still pick whatever machine they want.  I'm in
group #2, and I suspect that like most others in the group, I did:

$ qemu-system-aarch64 ...
qemu-system-aarch64: No machine specified, and there is no default
Use -machine help to list supported machines
$ qemu-system-aarch64 -M ?
...shows long list of machines that i'm unfamiliar with...
virt-2.10            QEMU 2.10 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.11            QEMU 2.11 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.12            QEMU 2.12 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.6             QEMU 2.6 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.7             QEMU 2.7 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.8             QEMU 2.8 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-2.9             QEMU 2.9 ARM Virtual Machine
virt-3.0             QEMU 3.0 ARM Virtual Machine
virt                 QEMU 3.1 ARM Virtual Machine (alias of virt-3.1)
virt-3.1             QEMU 3.1 ARM Virtual Machine

(aha! those "virt" machines look generic enough that they'll work...)
$ qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt ...

I honestly don't know if it would be better to have a FAQ on why there
is no default, or just to set a default.  Personally, I'd prefer just
having a default.

If you do decide against a default, I would suggest at least printing
the url to the FAQ entry on why arm doesn't have a default, instead of
just asking users to pick one out of the -M ? list.
