Right... which means the clock is effectively stopped for the
migration downtime window while we transfer the final state.  That
means the guest clock will drift from wall clock by a couple of
hundred ms across the migration which is not correct.

By implicit I mean the stopping of the VM which qemu does to transfer
the final part of the state, rather than because of an explicit
stop/cont command.

If you have a lot of process stalls across a migration, that suggests
your permitted downtime window is *way* too long.
