I assume this might be a chance to consolidate all of the methodologies
we use for actually checking if there was an error or not. There have
been many and I am sure Markus can give us a history lesson if it's
warranted.

Generally, there's a few paradigms I see a lot:

1. Rely on an error return code being produced by the called function.
The caller trusts that errp was set. This is one of my favorite methods,
because it has the least scaffolding.

2. Pass errp directly to the called function, and check for null after
return. I don't like this method very much, because of confusion with:

3. Create a local error object; check THAT for null, and propagate the
error to the common error object. I think Markus has explained why we
have this code 50 times, and I forget again minutes later.


If we want to expand the concept of the error object into something that
encompasses hints, warnings and deprecations*, checking for null is no
longer appropriate. It might be a good chance to make our error
propagation story more consistent, too.

We could unify with a helper like this, I think, if I'm not forgetting
some crucial usage detail:

subroutine(foo, bar, errp);
if (failure(errp)) {
    error_append_hint(errp, "Lorem ipsum, ...");
    cleanup();
    return;
}

We would then always use this pattern that operates directly on the
caller's errp instead of creating local error objects to allow hints and
warnings to accumulate.



(* I'm not proposing all three in a concrete way, but just referencing
the general class of semantic non-error information we may want to
propagate, however we end up deciding to model it.)

SHOULD it pass it along? Libvirt knows what QMP is invoking, that should
be opaque to upper layers. a "DEPRECATION" log stream might give the
wrong idea -- that it's not the libvirt feature that's deprecated, but
something in one of the many drivers it has.

I think it's fine to relay this information via generic logging to the
higher levels (so that debugging can be facilitated from that level) but
I don't think it needs special access to these notices because they're
not useful to RHV developers or RHV users.

Because the user didn't request those specific QMP features, they asked
for the VM to start, or to stop, or they asked for a backup, or a snapshot.

On my desktop, I am not really too interested in knowing if XFCE is
using deprecated features of xorg or wayland. I didn't tell it to use
them and I have no real power or control over that. It's nice if I'm a
developer, but as a user, it's noise.

So a development log seems right for these, but not user-visible
interruptions.

Yeah, sure. I'm still a fan of the end result of having QMP return
messages including that information. I just don't think it makes sense
for libvirt to then relay it to the user or up the stack. I don't think
that's the same as proposing that it hides it, either.
