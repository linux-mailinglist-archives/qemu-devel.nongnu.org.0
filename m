I'm unsure. The current formula seems to match the commit description.
Implication -- that is, "A implies B", (A-->B) -- is equivalent to (!A
|| B).

We have "no_aa32 || arm_div", which corresponds to "aa32 implies
arm_div" (aa32-->arm_div). And that seems to match exactly what Peter sai=
d.

The assert you suggest would fire on a host that supports at least one
of aa32 and arm_div (=3D the assertion would fail if (aa32 || arm_div)).
That would break on my host (hw+kernel) just the same, in the end. To
substitute the boolean values:

-    assert(false || false)
+    assert(false && true)

Thanks
Laszlo
