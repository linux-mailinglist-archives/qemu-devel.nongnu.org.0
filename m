I honestly don't understand this one. Can you rephrase/explain in more
detail what you mean by "stop inside [the] requested region"?

"the selected region"
"the current level"

I think that would make sense.

Can this assertion be moved above the if (first)?

"is also responsible"
"the unallocated region in the previous level"

Any reason for deleting this comment? I think it's still valid.
