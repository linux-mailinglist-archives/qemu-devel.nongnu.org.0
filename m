Correct, "[PATCH 24/24] qdev: Assert onboard devices all get realized
properly" supersedes.

It's where they sat while I developed my fixes, so I don't go
cross-eyed, too :)

Since realization assigns a QOM parent to orphans, "[PATCH 24/24] qdev:
Assert onboard devices all get realized properly" supersedes PATCH 4,
too.  I needed both PATCH 1 and 4 to track down missing realizes,
because some were visible only in "info qtree" (PATCH 4), and some only
in "info qom-tree" (PATCH 1).

"[PATCH 22/24] qdev: Assert devices are plugged into a bus that can take
them" supersedes PATCH 5.

Thanks!
