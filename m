Any network storage suffers from long network latencies, so it always
matters if you do more IOs than necessary.

We use this for several years now in production, and it is not a problem.
(Ceph storage is mostly on 10G (or faster) network equipment).

No idea. I just observed that upstream qemu backups with ceph are=20
quite unusable this way.
