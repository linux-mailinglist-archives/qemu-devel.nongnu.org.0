I want to say I am impressed by your deep review. Your design is
obviously way cleaner/safer. I think I was missing some part of the big
picture here, thank you for your detailed comments!

I did not know how vmgenid is processed. The only difference is I don't
want the edk2crypto class to be a device, but rather a simple user
object, and we already have an interface that does that:
TYPE_USER_CREATABLE. Its UserCreatableClass::complete() method is
similar to DeviceClass::realize() in managing errors at object
instantiation, so the machine done notifier never fails.
I'll respin.

Regards,

Phil.
