I'm still of the opinion that the bitmaps code should be replaced.
With this current design we are iterating over the slot of keys slots
4 times, doing different checks/logic in each iteration. This is really
not nice for understanding how the code works. IMHO we should be iterating
at most twice - once to validate the requested configuration, and once
to apply the requested configuration.   Even if there si duplication of
logic in between the delete/add key codepaths, I think it will be better
as the logic for each operation will be in one place.
