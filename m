Well, it's kind of irrelevant but I am trying that on archlinux and this
does not work for me.

Using systemd-244.2-1 and qemu-user-static-4.2 that I built with
Laurent's patch. May be I have done something wrong ?

I still get that error that leads me here:

Failed to enqueue loopback interface start request: Operation not supported
Caught <SEGV>, dumped core as pid 3.
Exiting PID 1...

I am trying to boot with systemd-nspawn an archlinux-arm built for a
rpi0. That's fine if I don't boot it.

Title:
  QEMU mishandling of SO_PEERSEC forces systemd into tight loop

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  While building Debian images for embedded ARM target systems I
  detected that QEMU seems to force newer systemd daemons into a tight
  loop.

  My setup is the following:

  Host machine: Ubuntu 18.04, amd64
  LXD container: Debian Buster, arm64, systemd 241
  QEMU: qemu-aarch64-static, 4.0.0-rc2 (custom build) and 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3=
.1+dfsg-7)

  To easily reproduce the issue I have created the following repository:
  https://github.com/lueschem/edi-qemu

  The call where systemd gets looping is the following:
  2837 getsockopt(3,1,31,274891889456,274887218756,274888927920) =3D -1 err=
no=3D34 (Numerical result out of range)

  Furthermore I also verified that the issue is not related to LXD.
  The same behavior can be reproduced using systemd-nspawn.

  This issue reported against systemd seems to be related:
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11557
