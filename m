Yes. But not everything that goes through the slow path is Device memory.
We can (should) fault on all accesses to Device memory, but we can't
fault on all accesses that are slow-pathed, because some of them could
be entirely valid Normal memory.

True when the romd device is in 'romd mode', ie mr->romd_mode is
true. Otherwise memory_region_is_romd() returns false and
tlb_set_page_with_attrs() treats it like normal MMIO, because
both read and write must take the slow path. (For flash this
happens when it is put into programming mode and reads from
the memory region are no longer simple reads from the backing
host RAM.)
