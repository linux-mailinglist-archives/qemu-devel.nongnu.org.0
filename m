I'm not sure this is the same issue I had before, but you might
find Frederic and Alexey suggestions from this thread helpful:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg525833.html

Also note vhost_region_add_section() you mentioned has this comment:

     if (need_add) {
         ...
         /* The flatview isn't stable and we don't use it, making it NULL
          * means we can memcmp the list.
          */
         dev->tmp_sections[dev->n_tmp_sections - 1].fv =3D NULL;

Maybe you need this change:

-- >8 --
--- a/hw/virtio/vhost.c
+++ b/hw/virtio/vhost.c
@@ -642,6 +642,7 @@ static void vhost_region_add_section(struct=20

          dev->tmp_sections[dev->n_tmp_sections - 1].fv =3D NULL;
          memory_region_ref(section->mr);
+        memory_region_update_container_subregions(section->mr);
      }
  }

Regards,

Phil.
