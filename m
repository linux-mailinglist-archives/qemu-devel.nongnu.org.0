I think the two main things we would need would be:
 (1) a proper data sheet for the pi2/pi3 USB controller. Last time I looked=
 there wasn't one available; it's pretty hard to model the controller prope=
rly without it. (Perhaps one has been released since I last looked.)
 (2) somebody who cares about the pi2/pi3 models and has the time to invest=
 in writing a device model for them
