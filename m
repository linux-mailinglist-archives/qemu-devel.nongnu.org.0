QOM relies on QAPI visitors to access properties.  There is no
integration with the QAPI schema.

Going through a visitor enables property access from QMP, HMP and CLI.

Access from C *also* goes through a visitor.  We typically go from C
type to QObject and back.  Comically inefficient (which hardly matters),
verbose to use and somewhat hard to understand (which does).

Compare to what QOM replaced: qdev.  Properties are a layer on top of
ordinary C.  From C, you can either use the C layer (struct members,
basically), or the property layer for C (functions taking C types, no
conversion to string and back under the hood), or the "text" layer
(parse from text / format to text).

My point is not that qdev was great and QOM is terrible.  There are
reasons we replaced qdev with QOM.  My point is QOM doesn't *have* to be
the way it is.  It is the way it is because we made it so.

I've long had the nagging feeling that if we had special-cased
containers, children and links, we could have made a QOM that was easier
to reason about, and much easier to integrate with a QAPI schema.
