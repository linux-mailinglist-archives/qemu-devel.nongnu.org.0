I've started a barebones project plan:
https://gitlab.com/bwidawsk/qemu/-/snippets/2070304

Jonathan, if you have a moment, perhaps you can send a MR summarizing CDAT/DOE
work from you and Chris?

If folks feel priorities are drastically off, we can discuss it in the snippet
comments.

As for wider acceptance, if I'm looking at this from the QEMU community
perspective, better test cases are really needed. If your fingers are itching
for some typing, might I suggest starting with that.

I've opted not to use issue tracker for this because I am hopeful this won't be
a long living gitlab project.
