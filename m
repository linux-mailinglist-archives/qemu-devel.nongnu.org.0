NB, we don't want to sacrifice coverage for contributors fork CI.

The current private runners don't do that because they're testing
scenarios that were already impossible with shared runners.

I'm confident we can rationalize our jobs, especially the cross
compilation ones.

For each non-x86 arch we've got two sets of jobs, one for system
emulators and one for user emulators.

IMHO the most interesting part of non-x86 testing is the TCG
host target. We don't need 2 jobs to cover that, either system
or user emulators would cover TCG build / test. Most of the rest
of code is not heavily host arch dependant.

So for cross compilation we could limit ourselves to

  - 1 job per TCG host target 
  - Some full coverage job(s) for a big endian arch
  - Some full coverage job(s) for a 32-bit arch

I expect that could eliminate quite a few cross arch jobs.


With regards,
Daniel
