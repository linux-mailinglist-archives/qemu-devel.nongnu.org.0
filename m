I fully agree with that and that is usually the exact reason I argue about such things:
Sometimes avoiding complexity in one place, and/or breaking consistency can introduce complexity in other place (like libvirt).

In this particular case, I won't argue about this, but still it kind of feels like
it is a precedent of requiring the user to supply redundant data.

Of all issues all of you pointed out (thanks!!) this is probably the least important one that I should be arguing about, 
so let it be like you say.
