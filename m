Aside from the iotests, so you forsee any particular use cases
where this feature is desirable / important ?

Looking at it from a security POV, I'm not thrilled about the
idea of granting QEMU permission to use the mount syscall for
seccomp or SELinux. IOW, I expect this feature won't be something
we want to expose in QEMU guests managed by libvirt, which would
limit how widely it can be used.

QEMU can export NBD. Would it make sense to do this as an NBD
client ? There's already https://libguestfs.org/nbdfuse.1.html
but IIUC that exposes it as a file within a dir. Presumably
it is not too hard to make it support exposing it directly as
a file too.

I wonder how performance compares between your native FUSE
impl in QEMU vs NBD FUSE ?

Daniel
