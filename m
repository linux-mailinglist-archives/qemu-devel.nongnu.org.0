I'm still not quite sure what you mean considering these typedefs in 
include/hw/pci/pci.h:

typedef void (*pci_set_irq_fn)(void *opaque, int irq_num, int level);
typedef int (*pci_map_irq_fn)(PCIDevice *pci_dev, int irq_num);
typedef PCIINTxRoute (*pci_route_irq_fn)(void *opaque, int pin);

pci_map_irq_fn already has PCIDevice *, it's pci_set_irq_fn that has void 
*opaque and is what this patch appears to be changing. Am I looking at the 
wrong typedefs?

Yes that seems to be an independent cahange so maybe it's better to just 
change piix4 in this series and then have a separate patch for changing 
the void *opaque to DeviceState * independent of this series. But I'm not 
sure that's necessarily a good idea. It may give some more checks but for 
callbacks used internally by device implementations I think it can be 
expected that code that registers the callback also knows what its opaque 
data should be so it does not have to be checked additionally, especially 
in code that may be called frequently. Although in a similar via-ide 
callback I could not measure a big penalty the last time I tried but I 
suspect there still mey be some overhead involving QOM casts (maybe there 
are just bigger bottle necks in ide emulation so it was masked) so I'm not 
sure it's worth the added complexity but if others prefer that I'm not 
that much opposed to it but it's clearer as a separate change anyway.
