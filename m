I was having a look at this and here's a simple example of how this can
happen:

qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o cluster_size=1k img.qcow2 1M
qemu-io -c 'write 0 3k' img.qcow2
qemu-io -c 'discard 0 1k' img.qcow2
qemu-io -c 'discard 2k 1k' img.qcow2
qemu-io -c 'write 512 2k' img.qcow2

The last write request can be performed with one single write operation
but it needs to allocate clusters #0 and #2.

This means that merge_cow() is called with offset=512, bytes=2k and two
QCowL2Meta structures:

  - The first one with cow_start={0, 512} and cow_end={1k, 0} 
  - The second one with cow_start={2k, 0} and cow_end={2560, 512}

In theory it should be possible to combine both into one that has
cow_start={0, 512} and cow_end={2560, 512}, but I don't think this
situation happens very often so I wouldn't go that way.

In any case, the checks have to remain and they cannot be turned into
assertions.
