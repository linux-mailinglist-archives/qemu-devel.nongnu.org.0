| No need to repeat "or an issue". I think it would read more clearly as
| 
|    - If the severity of the issue is sufficiently low, an upstream public bug
|      may be created immediately.

  Okay.

| 
|    - If the severity of the issue requires co-ordinated disclosure at a future
|      date, then the embargo process below is followed, and public bug will be
|      opened at the end of the set embargo period.

  Okay.
  
| Somewhere around here is probably a good place to link to:
| 
|   https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/security.html
| 
| which describes why we'll consider some things to be not security issues

  Towards the end, there's a section about 'How impact & severity of an issue 
is decided', above link will fit in there good I think.

| 
|

...
|   "The preferred embargo period will be upto 2 weeks, however, longer
|    embargoes can be negotiated if the severity of the issues requires it."

Okay, will add above changes.

Thank you.
