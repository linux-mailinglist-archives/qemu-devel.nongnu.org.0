I won't be attending KVM Forum this year, but Christian should be around.

We have 2) on s390x after a QEMU machine update. You need a QEMU update=20
usually either way to support the new CPU feature. But I can see how=20
decoupling the CPU model definition from the machine makes this easier.=20
It does introduce complexity. It applies only when running older QEMU=20
machines, or if we have to update a CPU model before we get a new QEMU=20
machine.

But we do have versioned CPU models already, so the discussion is=20
already over :)

I would describe that not a bug but a feature :) It does come with the=20
price that only using the newest QEMU machine results in the newest CPU=20
model, that part I understand.
