Yes.  I can't wait for having test suites try this, but releases and
impatience are not a good mix.

Appreciated!

Apropos experimental: we may choose to move from the x- naming
convention to a special feature flag "experimental".  That way, we don't

The comma is an accident.

The Authors section is custom, not necessity.
