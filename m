The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  QEMU Crashes on Launch, Windows

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I an having no issues up to (and including) v5.0.0-rc0, but when I
  move to rc1 ... it won't even execute in Windows. If I just try to,
  for example, run

  qemu-system-x86_64.exe --version

  No output, it just exits. This seems to be new with this version.

  Thanks!
