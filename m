Hi, Daniel.
Actually, I have tried to use qio_channel_shutdown at the same place, but it seems not work right.
the socket connection is closed by observing through 'ss' command but the socket fds in /proc/$(qemu pid)/fd are still
residual.

The underlying QIOChannelSocket will be closed by qio_channel_socket_finalize() through object_unref(QIOChannel) later in socket_send_channel_destroy(),
does that means it is safe to close both of TLS and tcp socket?
