SDEI doesn't quite describe *why* and *how* you enter it. You just get=20
there by
some mean (SError, Group-0 interrupt, or IMPlementation DEFined=20
mechanism).
It is then for the SDEI implementation to sort it out and enter the OS=20
using the
registered entry point.

No, I don't agree. QEMU and KVM are OS agnostic, and there is nothing in=20
the ARMv8
architecture that talks about "crash dumps".  If your "nmi" command=20
generates
a SDEI event and that event gets dispatched to the guest, it is entirely=20
the guest's
responsibility to do whatever it wants. We should stay clear of assuming=20
behaviours.

And I'm glad. SDEI, as I said, is absolutely horrible. I'm also very=20
fortunate
to have been CC'd on this series on an email address I cannot read.
This would have huge impacts on both QEMU and KVM, and this needs more=20
than
a knee jerk reaction to support a QEMU command.

And to be honest, if what you require is the guest kernel to panic, why=20
don't
you just implement a QEMU-specific driver in Linux that does just that?
Some kind of watchdog driver, maybe?

Thanks,

         M.
