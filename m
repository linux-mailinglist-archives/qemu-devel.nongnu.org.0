I think not. Obviously each firmware should have its own ABI no matter 
whether its public or proprietary. For proprietary firmware, it should 
be understood by the proprietary userspace counterpart.

Again, it should have an ABI there (either device or spec) no matter 
whether or not it's a transport layer. And there will be an endpoint in 
the userspace know all the format.

Which uAPI do you mean here?

I feel that you tried to explain "why it can be" but not "why it must 
be". Trying to find one or two subsystems that have opaque uAPI without 
ABI (though I suspect there will be one) may not convince here.
