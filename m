Title:
  Mouse stops working when connected usb-storage-device

Status in QEMU:
  Expired
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Expired

Bug description:
  I'm running a guest that has Windows 8 Pro (x64) installed. Every time
  I pass through a usb storage device from the host to the guest, the
  mouse stops working in the vnc client. When I remove the usb-device
  the mouse works again.

  The mouse only stops working when I pass through a usb storage device
  and then make the vlc viewer (client) inactive by clicking on another
  program on the local computer (where I'm running the vnc viewer
  (client)). As long as I keep the vnc viewer active, the mouse works
  without any problems. But as soon as I make the vnc viewer inactive
  and then active again, the mouse will no longer work. I have to reboot
  the guest or remove the usb storage device.

  I can't find any related problems on the internet, so it may be just
  me?

  I hope someone can help me with this.

  EDIT: I posted the extra/new information in comments. But as I know
  see it might be wrong and maybe I should've posted them in this bug
  description container (by editing)? Please tell me if I did it wrong
  and I will change it. Sorry for this misunderstanding.
