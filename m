Yes, this is what we do in ovirt-imageio for file based storage:
https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-imageio/blob/ca70170886b0c1fbeca8640b12bcf54f01a3fea0/common/ovirt_imageio_common/backends/file.py#L311

But we have lot of assumptions that may not work for qemu:
- we don't support read only images
- we assume nobody else is writing to the image imageio uses
  (enforced by oVirt)

So this will not work for qemu-img read-only operations.

However, this will break down with read-only images, so if we can't

If this happen only when using Gluster performance.strict-o-direct = off,
we will
enforce performance.strict-o-direct = in oVirt.

Otherwise this is a Gluster bug and it should be fixed in Gluster.
