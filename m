This is the follow up of
    "[PATCH RFC] memory: Don't allow to resize RAM while migrating" [1]

This series contains some (slightly modified) patches also contained in:
    "[PATCH v2 fixed 00/16] Ram blocks with resizable anonymous allocations
     under POSIX" [2]
That series will be based on this series. The last patch (#13) in this
series could be moved to the other series, but I decided to include it in
here for now (similar context).

I realized that resizing RAM blocks while the guest is being migrated
(precopy: resize while still running on the source, postcopy: resize
 while already running on the target) is buggy. In case of precopy, we
can simply cancel migration. Postcopy handling is more involved. Resizing
can currently happen during a guest reboot, triggered by ACPI rebuilds.

Along with the fixes, some cleanups.

I was now able to actually test resizing while migrating. I am using the
prototype of virtio-mem to test (which also makes use of resizable
allocations). Things I was able to reproduce:
- Resize while still running on the migration source. Migration is canceled
-- Test case for "migraton/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during precopy"
- Resize (grow+shrink) on the migration target during postcopy migration
  (when syncing RAM blocks), while not yet running on the target
-- Test case for "migration/ram: Discard new RAM when growing RAM blocks
   and the VM is stopped", and overall RAM size synchronization. Seems to
   work just fine.
- Resize (grow+shrink) on the migration tagret during postcopy migration
  while already running on the target.
-- Test case for "migration/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during postcopy"
-- Test case for "migration/ram: Tolerate partially changed mappings in
   postcopy code" - I can see that -ENOENT is actually triggered and that
   migration succeeds. Migration seems to work just fine.

In addition I run avocado-vt migration tests + usual QEMU checks.

v1 -> v2:
- "util: vfio-helpers: Factor out and fix processing of existing ram
   blocks"
-- Stringify error
- "migraton/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during precopy"
-- Simplified check if we're migrating on the source
- "exec: Relax range check in ram_block_discard_range()"
-- Added to make discard during resizes actually work
- "migration/ram: Discard new RAM when growing RAM blocks after
   ram_postcopy_incoming_init()"
-- Better checks if in the right postcopy mode.
-- Better patch subject/description/comments
- "migration/ram: Handle RAM block resizes during postcopy"
-- Better comments
-- Adapt to changed postcopy checks
- "migrate/ram: Get rid of "place_source" in ram_load_postcopy()"
-- Dropped, as broken
- "migration/ram: Tolerate partially changed mappings in postcopy code"
-- Better comment / description. Clarify that no implicit wakeup will
   happen
-- Warn on EINVAL (older kernels)
-- Wake up any waiter explicitly
