there was cleanup patch like this in v2, which I dropped for now
as it needs more not directly related this refactoring.
See my reply to: "[PATCH v4 43/80] x86/pc: use memdev for RAM"
I dropped it since if above were done, it would trigger a bunch
of changes /to properly handle case/ to boards that do not care
about -m and manage RAM in its own way and not related to
removing memory_region_allocate_system_memory().

I'm not saying it shouldn't be done but rather,
it should be done on top to take in account cases for fixed size
boards and for boards that do not use -m at all and just create
RAM memory region on its own.

name came up from current meaning of the value stored there,
namely boards use value as the default memory region id.
But optin behavior is not clear from that, How about adding
following to doc comment to make intent explicit:

diff --git a/include/hw/boards.h b/include/hw/boards.h
index 56a4dd9..142b86d 100644

+++ b/include/hw/boards.h
