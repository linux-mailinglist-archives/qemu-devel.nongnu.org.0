IIUC the comment refers to multiple virtqueue. It is trying to say that
we do not need to send VHOST_USER_SET_MEM_TABLE for each
virtqueue.

Some backends register multiple dev instances per backend: one for each
virtqueue.  This check avoids sending VHOST_USER_SET_MEM_TABLE more than
once in this case.

I think vhost-scsi has a single instance per backend, that is
why vq_index is 0.

I don't think that is the case. It's possible that memory hotplug has
bugs with vhost-user, but I don't think it's anything fundamental.
