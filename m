My test setup is now Debian Buster with qemu-system-arm 3.1 and a host
with KVM-enabled Kernel 4.9.61 on Odroid XU4.

Following results:
--------
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -smp 2 -m 512 -kernel vmlinuz -initrd initr=
d.gz -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1.dtb -device virtio-blk-device,drive=3Dinst-=
blk -drive file=3DPATHTOFILE,id=3Dinst-blk,if=3Dnone,format=3Draw -append "=
vga=3Dnormal rw console=3DttyAMA0" -nographic -enable-kvm

Still not working as above, so it doesn't seem to be fixed for 3.1.
--------
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15,secure=3Doff -smp 2 -m 512 -kernel vmlinuz =
-initrd initrd.gz -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1.dtb -device virtio-blk-device,=
drive=3Dinst-blk -drive file=3DPATHTOFILE,id=3Dinst-blk,if=3Dnone,format=3D=
raw -append "vga=3Dnormal rw console=3DttyAMA0" -nographic -enable-kvm

No errors but no output at all, can switch to qemu monitor, but don't know =
if system is running
--------
Option 1 and Option 2 both start the Debian installer as expected WITHOUT t=
he parameter -enable-kvm


I did also tests with the virt board as recommended. With the parameter -en=
able-kvm none of the different virt-* boards did output anything to the con=
sole, without KVM the virt-boards did start. =


virt-2.6 and virt-2.7 did boot into the installer without KVM.

Any more recent version (2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 3.0 and 3.1) returned

"Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0109ed30"
(address is changing)

during the init process. With different guest memory sizes the paging
error occurred at a different init step.

Conclusion:
1) EL3 feature does still seem to be enabled in qemu 3.1 (Debian) even for =
KVM-enabled guests.
2) Any recommendation for a support forum to discuss my trouble with the mi=
ssing console output when enabling KVM and the paging problems with the rec=
ent virt boards outside this bug report?

Title:
  cpu_address_space_init fails with assertion

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  qemu-system-arm does not start with version >=3D 2.6 and KVM enabled.

    cpu_address_space_init: Assertion `asidx =3D=3D 0 || !kvm_enabled()'
  failed.

  Hardware is Odroid XU4 with Exynos with 4.9.61+ Tested with Debian
  Stretch (9) or Buster (10).

  Without KVM it is running fine but slow. I'm operating Debian Jessie
  with qemu 2.1 for a long time with KVM virtualization working
  flawlessly. When I upgraded to Stretch I ran into the trouble
  described before. I tried Debian Stretch and Buster with all Kernels
  provided by the Board manufacturer (Hardkernel).

  It seems to be related to the feature introduced in Version 2.6:
  https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.6
  - Support for a separate EL3 address space

  KVM is enabled, so I assume the adress space index asidx to be causing
  the assert to fail.

  dmesg | grep -i KVM
  [    0.741714] kvm [1]: 8-bit VMID
  [    0.741721] kvm [1]: IDMAP page: 40201000
  [    0.741729] kvm [1]: HYP VA range: c0000000:ffffffff
  [    0.742543] kvm [1]: Hyp mode initialized successfully
  [    0.742600] kvm [1]: vgic-v2@10484000
  [    0.742924] kvm [1]: vgic interrupt IRQ16
  [    0.742943] kvm [1]: virtual timer IRQ60

  Full command line is:
  qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a15 -smp 2 -m 512 -cpu host -enable-kvm -kern=
el vmlinuz -initrd initrd.gz -dtb vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1.dtb -device virtio-=
blk-device,drive=3Dinst-blk -drive file=3DPATHTOFILE,id=3Dinst-blk,if=3Dnon=
e,format=3Draw -append "vga=3Dnormal rw console=3DttyAMA0" -nographic

  Is there anything to do to understand, if this is a hardware related
  failure or probably just a missing parameter?

  Regards

  Lutz
