Yes, it can certainly be surprising to users. It is a never ending
source of support requests from users. Note this isn't an AMD problem,
it affects Intel too, and indeed any scenario where features can be
hidden/visible based on firmware settings or microcode updates.

The classic is Intel removing the TSX related features in microcode
updates, which results in their CPUs loosing the hle and rtm features.
This has caused migration compatibility pain for so many people.

Yes, these are exactly the questions we get from users quite
frequently.

Ultimately we need to explain that there's more to CPU compatibility
than merely the physical hardware, rather it covers

 - Physical CPU
 - Microcode update
 - Firmware settings
 - Host kernel version
 - QEMU version

Any one of those pieces can prevent a given feature being usable
by the guest, and so be the cause of live migration compatibility
trouble.

The number 1 priority is that mgmt apps don't allow the migration
to start if there is such an incompatibility, and we're pretty
good at that now.

After that is becomes a documentation and training problem. It is
important to understand that if users have a cluster of machines that
they want to live migrate between, keeping those 5 pieces in sync
across all machines is very important. Microcode is usually the most
trouble, since it is the one that actively removes existing features
most frequently. We've had the kernel remove features proactively
though, to prevent VMs using them, in the expectation that a future
microcode update might later remove the same feature.

Daniel
