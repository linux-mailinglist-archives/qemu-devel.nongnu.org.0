NB the VNC cut+paste impl is technically undefined  for non-7-bit ascii
data. In reality though I'd assume most servers/clients and up sending
UTF8.

I agree - the agent based approach also lets you have a bi-directional
solution. ie copy in the guest, paste in the host, which you can't
do by simulating key presses.  Simulating keypress is insanely slow
too, so useless for more than 100 bytes of text really.

I've never looked at the spice-guest-agent code, but I wonder if there
is any scope for re-using it with VNC, or is it too closely tangled
up with SPICE ?  The advantage of reuse is that all existing guest
OS with spice-guest-agent installed will "just work".

I think the VNC clipboard stuff is too crude to base a long term
design on. I figure we'll want to be at least inspired by (3) or
(4).

The QEMU guest agent is a single system level agent. IIUC, with SPICE
you have a single system level agent, and then zero or more session
level agents - one per desktop login basically. I assume we'll want
to support the latter too, at least from a design level, even if we
don't implemnet multi session straight away.

Daniel
