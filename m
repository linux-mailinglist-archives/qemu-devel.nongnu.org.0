Yes, the compile error comes from kernel 3.10, and it seems necessary
to solve this. I try to reuse qemu_lock_fd() to compat F_GETLK/F_SETLK,
but its semantics differs from fcntl, so I think using #ifdef will be
easier.

We could delete F_GETLK/F_SETLK compat when virtiofsd is limited to be
built in newer kernel. And I'm glad to hear from other developers.

Thanks,
Jun
