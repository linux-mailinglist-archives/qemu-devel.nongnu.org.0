The numbers aren't magic, they're part of the name. '1' in the above
'sve1' means one quadword. It would probably have been better to use bits
instead in the example, i.e.

  -cpu host,sve128=on,sve256=on,sve384=off,sve512=on

where it's now clear that "sve512" has an analogy with x86's "avx512".

So I set off to convince Igor of the wide word idea (he sits next to me,
so I didn't have go far), but he has convinced me of the above property
idea. He used the magic phrase: "less code would be needed". If we use
the properties like above then we get introspection for free (cpu property
listing which libvirt already knows how to do) - so no QMP query needed.
The cost is adding several properties (16 to handle the current 2048-bit
limit), but I guess that's cheap enough. The command line is verbose, but
also much easier for a human to construct and read. I'm pretty sold on
this path, but adding Andrea and Eduardo for their input as well.

Thanks,
