A human-friendly approach to this problem would never even
have the generic "amend" design IMHO. Friendly would be to
have a CLI that is approx the same as "cryptsetup" provides
eg

    $ qemu-img add-key /path/to/disk
    enter key>..
    re-enter key>...

or

    qemu-img add-key --keyfile /some/file.txt /path/to/disk
