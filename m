Yes, you can do just

   common_ss.add(when: curl, if_true: files('curl.c'))

as a replacement for

   common-obj-$(CONFIG_CURL) += curl.c
   curl.c-cflags = $(CURL_CFLAGS)
   curl.c-libs = $(CURL_LIBS)


If conditional compilation is handled inside the file, i.e the same but
with common-obj-y, you can instead do

   common_ss.add(files('vl.c'), sdl)


In both cases, the cflags from the dependency are applied to the whole
target, rather than just to repectively curl.c and vl.c.  So you do lose
the possibility of specifying cflags only for a file.

There is no case where we're using per-.o file CFLAGS for anything other
than dependencies.  I was using per-file -f... options in the
(not-yet-applied) CET series though.  I would have to check whether
pragmas work in that case (if they do, I feel they are superior to
specifying CFLAGS in the Makefile).

Per-file (really per-device) would really be easier than per-directory,
I think, because with fine-grained trace-events there is a point in
including a specific header like

   #include "trace-mptsas.h"

or even

   #include "trace/trace-mptsas.h"

(possibly generated from trace-events-mptsas).  The only constraint
would be that the subsystem names would have to be global across all of
QEMU.  If it's per-directory as it is now, instead, you'd have something
like

   #include "trace/trace-hw_scsi.h"

which is really ugly and then forwarding headers look better.
