Well, the fundamental issue is not that hard actually.  We have three
cases:

(1) GUEST_MAXPHYADDR == HOST_MAXPHYADDR

    Everything is fine ;)

(2) GUEST_MAXPHYADDR < HOST_MAXPHYADDR

    Mostly fine.  Some edge cases, like different page fault errors for
    addresses above GUEST_MAXPHYADDR and below HOST_MAXPHYADDR.  Which I
    think Mohammed fixed in the kernel recently.

(3) GUEST_MAXPHYADDR > HOST_MAXPHYADDR

    Broken.  If the guest uses addresses above HOST_MAXPHYADDR everything
    goes south.

The (2) case isn't much of a problem.  We only need to figure whenever
we want qemu allow this unconditionally (current state) or only in case
the kernel fixes are present (state with this patch applied if I read it
correctly).

The (3) case is the reason why guest firmware never ever uses
GUEST_MAXPHYADDR and goes with very conservative heuristics instead,
which in turn leads to the consequences discussed at length in the
OVMF thread linked above.

Ideally we would simply outlaw (3), but it's hard for backward
compatibility reasons.  Second best solution is a flag somewhere
(msr, cpuid, ...) telling the guest firmware "you can use
GUEST_MAXPHYADDR, we guarantee it is <= HOST_MAXPHYADDR".

Yep, better defaults for GUEST_MAXPHYADDR would be good too, but that
is a separate (although related) discussion.

take care,
