Not sure I can find the time before the soft freeze.  Best not to wait
for me.

We don't have to agree on everything.  I'm not the QEMU CLI dictator.
The status quo is pretty clear, though:

    $ qemu-system-ppc64 -help
    [...]
    -m [size=]megs[,slots=n,maxmem=size]
                    configure guest RAM
                    size: initial amount of guest memory
    [...]

It says "Initial amount of guest memory", not "Approximate amount of
guest memory" or something like that.

If we decide we want to change it from "Initial amount of guest memory"
to some "do what I mean" behavior, then that behavior needs to be
documented.

Moreover, if DWIM is appropriate for one machine, it's probably
appropriate for all of them.  The CLI should be as consistent as we can
make it across machines.
