Managed to get a coredump. Coredumps usually tell me nothing but maybe
someone here can find something useful in there...

Title:
  qemu-arm-static crashes "segmentation fault" when running "svn
  checkout"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm not actually sure how far I can help as I so far failed to
  reproduce the issue on my local VM but I get it on Travis CI every
  time. I even went through the hassle of hacking a Debian repository
  into their Ubuntu Bionic VM to get qemu 4.2 as I hoped a new version
  could fix this.

  This build runs in an armv6h chroot. I don't get the segfault if I do
  the same on an armv7h chroot for some reason.

  Here is where the error occured: https://travis-
  ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/309106220#L5420

  Maybe now I'll just try to remove all uses of svn in my build
  scripts...

  Is it actually a viable solution to cross-build with qemu? I'm
  starting to doubt it...

  Would it help if I manage to get this core dump out of Travis somehow
  (maybe make Travis push it to some GIT or upload it to my webserver)?
