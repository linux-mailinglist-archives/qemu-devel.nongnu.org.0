Also even though we don't model that but real hardware can switch between=
=20
native and legacy mode so in reality all boards need all irqs as they=20
could be used depending on device setting. I think this legacy-irq thing=20
is something peculiar to pegasos2 so using a feature but only set by that=
=20
board is appropriate here. Unless you can propose something simpler you=20
could just accept it at least for now and maybe we can try to clean it up=
=20
later when other parts of the southbridge are qdevified.
