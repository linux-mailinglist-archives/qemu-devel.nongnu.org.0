It depends on whether -blockdev is in use.  With -blockdev, libvirt 
should be supplying a node name everywhere, without, it is only device 
names.

Does Max' work to improve seeing through filters fix this?

That bug has been marked CLOSED in the meantime, but it appears to be 
only because libvirt is now using -blockdev rather than the older drive, 
while the problem affects drive usage.

Okay, after reading some more history on this project (the curse of 
coming up to speed after volunteering to become a co-maintainer), it 
looks like Max's idea replaces this patch altogether.  How much of the 
rest of the series is still important?
