Hm.  I don=E2=80=99t think it would be that much more simpler.  (Instead of=
 just
putting it into this function.)  But perhaps cleaner.

One of the problems is that I don=E2=80=99t want to actually parse JSON her=
e.
That leaves us with the problem of what to do with line breaks.  Both
QMP stuff and any Formatting line may contain line breaks (and there
actually are iotests that have line breaks in their Formatting line).

In this function, I opted to allow line breaks in Formatting lines, but
not in QMP.  If we had a separate function specifically for Formatting
stuff in QMP, I think it should probably work the other way around.

So what this other function would do is probably to just echo all lines
that don=E2=80=99t start with Formatting, and filter those Formatting line(=
s)
through _filter_img_create.  (I don=E2=80=99t think we need to support
multi-line Formatting lines in QMP output.)

I think that should work.  And it=E2=80=99s probably indeed cleaner than pu=
tting
both into a single function.  I=E2=80=99ll try my hands on it.

In my experience, some knowledge can turn out harmful, because suddenly
