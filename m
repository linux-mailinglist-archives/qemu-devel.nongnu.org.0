I compiled 4.1.0 on the Raspberry, everything seemed to compile.

I have verified with qemu-system-i386 --version displays 4.1.0

Using the below basic command line:

qemu-system-i386 -hda c.hda -cdrom FD12CD.iso -boot order=3Dd

now when I try to execute the qemu I get only below as it just seems to
hang:


WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'c.hda' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, wr=
ite operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

Status in QEMU:

Bug description:
  I am trying to access the CDROM (iso) from QEMU using FreeDOS and I
  get an error when doing a directory for:

  i can boot from the iso but if i exit to access the files from the
  CDROM ISO i get the attached error.

  I believe there is an issue with the QEMU for the Raspberry Pi.

  I am using a Raspberry Pi3 with the latest full Raspbian Buster load
