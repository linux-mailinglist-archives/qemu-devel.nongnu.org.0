The alternative would be to add a VM state change handler to all other
HBAs, too, so that scsi-bus never has to register its own handler. I
don't think we have that many HBAs, so maybe it's actually workable.

Of course, this makes me think that maybe for the actual proper
solution, VM state change handlers should really be a feature that qdev
provides for devices. Then if a HBA doesn't have anything else to do,
the qdev core would just recurse into the children right away; if it has
something to do, it would disable the device after its children, and
re-enable it before the children.

However, I'm afraid we're talking about a major feature then and not
about a simple fix any more. :-(
