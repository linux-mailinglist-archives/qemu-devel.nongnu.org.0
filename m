Thank you very much!
BTW, the qemu driver does allocate zeroed memory (in nvme_init_queue,=20
"q->queue =3D qemu_try_blockalign0(bs, bytes);"

Thus I think this is all that is needed in that regard.

Note that this patch doesn't fix any real bug I know of,=20
but just makes the thing right in regard to the spec.
Also racing with hardware in theory can have various memory ordering bugs=
,
although in this case the writes are done in=20
entries which controller probably won't touch, but still.

TL;DR - no need in code which does nothing and might cause issues.

Do you want me to resend the series or shall I wait till we decide
what to do with the image creation support? I done fixing all the
review comments long ago, just didn't want to resend the series.
Or shall I drop that patch and resend?

From the urgency standpoint the only patch that really should
be merged ASAP is the one that adds support for block sizes,
because without it, the whole thing crashes and burns on 4K
nvme drives.
