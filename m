The vmx things make me wonder about a fix Paolo did a while ago for
enabling inidivudal vmx features rather than vmx as a whole;  but I
can't remember if that was a kernel or qemu fix.

One thing I notice, that may be a red-herring, all of the machine code
in the errors are 'f3 0f 1e fb' which is the new 'endbr32' security
instruction - but that's really a rep nop, that I thought old
instructions can handle anyway??

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
