Hi Colin,
I didn't read much if the details but I think it is clear.

Per request of IBM focal got -march=3Dz13 but tcg has no emulation for some
of the instructions of this cpu.

That is the breakage that you are seeing and afaik there is nothing we can
do than waiting for qemu to grow that support.

Title:
  qemu s390x on focal - applications breaking

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Running qemu-system-s390x (1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu10) on an x86-64 Focal
  host with an upgrade of a Eoan s390x VM to a Focal s390x is triggering
  random breakage, for example:

  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

  ...
  ...

  Unpacking debianutils (4.9) over (4.8.6.3) ...
  Setting up debianutils (4.9) ...
  Use of uninitialized value $ARGV[0] in string ne at /usr/sbin/update-mime=
 line 43.
  (Reading database ... 83640 files and directories currently installed.)
  Preparing to unpack .../bash_5.0-5ubuntu1_s390x.deb ...
  Unpacking bash (5.0-5ubuntu1) over (5.0-4ubuntu1) ...
  Setting up bash (5.0-5ubuntu1) ...
  [12124.788618] User process fault: interruption code 0007 ilc:3 in bash[2=
aa3d780000+149000]
  dpkg: error processing package bash (--configure):
   installed bash package post-installation script subprocess was killed by=
 signal (Floating point exception), core du
  mped
  Errors were encountered while processing:
   bash
  E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

  And now bash is completely broken:

  cking@eoan-s390x:~$ bash
  [12676.204389] User process fault: interruption code 0007 ilc:3 in bash[2=
aa14780000+149000]

  Floating point exception (core dumped)

  The upgrade works OK on a s390x, so I'm assuming it's something to do
  with the qemu emulation.
