Thanks Connie for having a look.

I do understand NOT_OPER, but I'm not sure about STANDBY.

Here is what the PoP says about cc 3 for SSCH.
"""
Condition code 3 is set, and no other action is
taken, when the subchannel is not operational for
START SUBCHANNEL. A subchannel is not opera-
tional for START SUBCHANNEL if the subchannel is
not provided in the channel subsystem, has no valid
device number associated with it, or is not enabled.
"""

Are we guaranteed to reflect one of these conditions back?

Under what circumstances do we expect that our request will
find the device in STANDBY?

So the answer seems to be, no EIO is also used for something else than
'device not operational' in a sense of the s390 IO architecture (cc=3
and stuff).

AFAIR the idea was that EIO means something is broken, and we decided
to reflect that as an unit check (because the broader device -- the
actual device + our pass-through code == device for the guest) is broken.
So I think it was a conscious choice.
