What is the plan forward with this? Are the patches dropped for good?

I think the plan was to drop Python 2 after QEMU 4.2, and then it
becomes really relevant what our minimum Python 3 version is. We've just
had another Python version discussion in the context of iotests (John
suggested using function annotations, but these are >= 3.5 only).

Also, the fallback to Python 2 obviously makes no sense any more then,
so maybe it's not that important to add for a single QEMU release?

As Peter seems to have indicated above that he found a replacement for
the test machine with an OS that isn't out of support, can we just
revive this patch as it is?

Kevin
