Toggling based on machine type feels strange. If it needs a toggle that
implies it is not something that can be transparently enabled without
the app being aware of it. Given that toggling based on machine  type
would be inappropriate as existing apps expect to work with new QEMU.

If it needs extra sockets that is something apps will need to be aware
of unfortunately and explicitly opt-in to :-( Migration is often
tunnelled/proxied over other channels, so whatever does that needs to
be aware of possibility of seeing extra sockets.

If it has an x- prefix then we can basically ignore it from a mgmt app
POV until it is actually finished.

Apps increasingly consider use of TLS to be a mandatory feature for
migration, so until that works, this preempt has to be considered
unsupported & unfinished IMHO. So either TLS should be ready when
it merges, or it should be clearly marked unsupported at the QAPI
level.
