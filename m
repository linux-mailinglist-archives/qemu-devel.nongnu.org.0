I chimmed in without much context, sorry if I'm going to ask naive
questions. :)

What I was asking is about why the resizing can happen.  A quick read
told me that it was majorly for easier extension of ROMs (firmware
updates?).  With that, I'm imaging a common case for memory
resizing...

  (1) Source QEMU runs VM on old host, with old firmware

  (2) Migrate source QEMU to destination new host, with new and bigger
      firmware

  (3) During the migration, the ROM size on the destination will still
      be the old, referring to ram_load_precopy(), as long as no
      system reset

  (4) After migration finished, when the system reboots, memory
      resizing happens with the new and bigger firmware loaded

And is this patch trying to fix/warn when there's a reboot during (3)
so the new size is discovered at a wrong time?  Is my understanding
correct?

Prior to this patch, would a precopy still survive with such an
accident (asked because I _feel_ like migrating a ramblock with
smaller used_length to the same ramblock with bigger used_length seems
to be fine?)?  Or we can stop the precopy and restart.  After this
patch, it'll crash the source VM (&error_abort specified in
memory_region_ram_resize()), which seems a bit more harsh?

Thanks,
