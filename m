The major thing sysbus being a bus gives you is reset: devices
on buses get reset automatically, but devices not on buses don't.
So in this particular case I'm not in favour of this change --
right now the TOSA_MISC_GPIO device doesn't happen to need a reset,
but having devices floating around in the system which can't have
a reset method is a beartrap for our future selves. It's bad enough
that we have this issue today with CPU objects: I don't want us to
extend that to anything else if we can avoid it.

This also is true -- some pretty generic useful stuff like "I can have
MMIO regions" and "I get automatically reset" is implemented in sysbus,
and some (like "I have gpio lines") for DeviceState. I would be happy
to see this cleaned up. For the code we have at the moment I prefer
to treat SysBusDevice as the preferred parent class for devices, ie
don't directly inherit from DeviceState unless you really know what
you're doing.

The reset stuff in particular is desperately in need of a cleanup
but it's a swamp, as usual. Currently we reset along the qbus tree
(which is why non-bus-connected devices don't get their qdev reset
method called, and must fend for themselves via qemu_register_reset()).
These days I feel like "resetting a device should reset all its QOM
children" would be a more natural way to model things (with some sort
of "this device needs to override that default behaviour" for SoCs
with more complicated reset handling) but getting there from here
feels like it would be very painful.

I was never much of a fan of dynamic sysbus devices at all :-)
