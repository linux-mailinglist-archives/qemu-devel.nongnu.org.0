Nah. Doing that now will make this series rely on acks for every other ACPI arch to
push the RISC-V side.

Let's make this happen as is now to get ACPI in RISC-V working. We can think about
reducing overall ACPI duplication later. IMO it's enough for now to, mention in this
commit msg, which bits of the arm64 virt-acpi-build.c you changed for this RISC-V
version.


Thanks,

Daniel
