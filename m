qemu allows multiple simultaneous NBD clients, but does not promise 
cache consistency between them.  As long as all the clients are 
read-only, you can't tell the difference (and thus, for read-only 
connections, qemu even advertises NBD_FLAG_CAN_MULTI_CONN per the NBD 
spec).  See also 'qemu-nbd -e' for controlling how many clients qemu-nbd 
will permit at once (when qemu proper is serving NBD, we don't currently 
expose a knob over QMP to control client count, but instead just blindly 
allow multiple connections).  But as soon as one of the clients wants to 
write, that is where we would need to improve code before making it 
safe, so there, we do not advertise MULTI_CONN support.

As for cases with multiple simultaneous clients: we already have those. 
In the case of incremental backups with an NBD export, my demo code for 
copying out the incremental backup involved two parallel NBD clients - 
one using 'qemu-img map' to probe which portions of the image were 
dirty, and a second client actually performing the reads.  But 
incremental backups are read-only situations (the clients are not 
modifying qemu state).
