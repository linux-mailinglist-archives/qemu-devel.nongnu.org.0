Update the documentation of QAPI document comment syntax to match
the new rST backend requirements. The principal changes are:
 * whitespace is now significant, and multiline definitions
   must have their second and subsequent lines indented to
   match the first line
 * general rST format markup is permitted, not just the small
   set of markup the old texinfo generator handled. For most
   things (notably bulleted and itemized lists) the old format
   is the same as rST was.
 * Specific things that might trip people up:
   - instead of *bold* and _italic_ rST has **bold** and *italic*
   - lists need a preceding and following blank line
   - a lone literal '*' will need to be backslash-escaped to
     avoid a rST syntax error
 * the old leading '|' for example (literal text) blocks is
   replaced by the standard rST '::' literal block.
 * headings and subheadings must now be in a freeform
   documentation comment of their own
 * we support arbitrary levels of sub- and sub-sub-heading, not
   just a main and sub-heading like the old texinfo generator

+Section headings must always be correctly nested, so you can only
+define a third-level heading inside a second-level heading, and so
+on. The documentation generator will catch nesting mistakes and report
+a syntax error.

-*foo* and _foo_ are for strong and emphasis styles respectively (they
-do not work over multiple lines).  @foo is used to reference a name in
-the schema.
+The usual '**strong**', '*emphasised*' and '``literal``' markup should
+be used. If you need a single literal '*' you will need to backslash-escape it.
+As an extension beyond the usual rST syntax, you can also
+use '@foo' to reference a name in the schema; this is rendered
+the same way as '``foo``'.
