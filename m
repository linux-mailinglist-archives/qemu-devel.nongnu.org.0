Right, my mistake was not to dig through the history. Will do that next
time.

For example see:

Actually this change isn't very insightful for unplug() callbacks. A more
interesting change is:

(a)
commit c97adf3ccfbfbe6885fd9de7293162489d293d44
Author: David Hildenbrand <david@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 12 10:16:19 2018 +0100

    pci/pcihp: perform unplug via the hotplug handler

which basically says that the original function
acpi_pcihp_device_unplug_cb() written by Igor got renamed to
acpi_pcihp_device_unplug_request_cb().

Now, in Igor's original version of acpi_pcihp_device_unplug_cb(), it did
have the check. See :

(b)
commit c24d5e0b91d138f8cc95f5694d4964de36a739d3
Author: Igor Mammedov <imammedo@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 5 16:36:49 2014 +0100

    acpi/piix4pm: convert ACPI PCI hotplug to use hotplug-handler API


Now because of (a) we see acpi_pcihp_device_unplug_request_cb() inherit
the bsel check from acpi_pcihp_device_unplug_cb() but the later no longer
gained it back.

Anyways maybe it is good enough to have the bsel check in the pre-unplug
handler. Still I would argue along the lines of the two points Igor
mentions above that if there is no one to catch the error, why have such
error messages printed on stderr anyway? A trace should be enough.

Yes I am aware of this article. Lets have a culture where people are
encouraged to spend their unpaid spare time looking into Qemu/Libvirt and
send patches.
