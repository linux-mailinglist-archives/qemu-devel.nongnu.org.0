We can add a list subcommand later if it is still desired.  I agree that=20
a tabular format:

name          enabled   granularity
bitmap1       false     65536
bitmap2       true      512

in isolation is easier to read than:

     bitmaps:
         [0]:
             flags:
             name: bitmap1
             granularity: 65536
         [1]:
             flags:
                 [0]: auto
             name: bitmap2
             granularity: 512

embedded inside even more information.

All of the operations take one bitmap name (the final BITMAP).=20
Additionally, the --merge operation takes a second bitmap name=20
(SOURCE_BITMAP).  None of the other operations need a second bitmap=20
name, so only --merge requires an option argument.  As written, the { a=20
| b | c } implies that operations are mutually exclusive: you can only=20
request one operation per qemu-img invocation.

That would be more transactional, and more effort to implement.  My=20
argument is that you should instead write:

$ qemu-img bitmap --add foo.qcow2 nbmap
$ qemu-img bitmap --merge sbmap foo.qcow2 nbmap
$ qemu-img bitmap --enable foo.qcow2 nbmap

where I only have to implement one operation per qemu-img.

The QMP command for add has an optional 'disabled' parameter, which I=20
exposed here.  Alternatively, we could indeed NOT expose that parameter=20
through qemu-img, but require two separate qemu-img bitmap commands to=20
add and then disable things.  Atomicity is not a concern here like it=20
was in QMP.  Removing that sugar does simplify things slightly.

Logically, '--add --disabled' matches the name of the QMP command with=20
its optional 'disabled' parameter, while --disable matches the name of=20
the QMP command.  We don't have to have the alias; and in fact, if you=20
agree that supporting '--add --disabled' is too much sugar (since we=20
don't care about atomicity the way QMP did), then life gets simpler to=20
drop --disabled altogether.

In command line syntax, I'm most used to seeing repetition as '...',=20
optional as [], and mutually-exclusive choice as {|}.  Yes, that's=20
different than EBNF.

If I understand, you're asking why we can't do:

qemu-img bitmap foo.qcow2 --add b1 --merge sb b1

in one operation.

That changes the syntax entirely, compared to what I implemented.  You'd=20
have to have an argument to every option, AND figure out how to specify=20
TWO arguments to the --merge option.  Might be doable, but seems hairy.

I still find it simpler to do exactly one operation per invocation.
