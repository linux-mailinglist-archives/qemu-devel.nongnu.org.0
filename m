Title:
  SYSRET instruction incorrectly implemented

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  The Intel architecture manual states that when returning to user mode,
  the SYSRET instruction will re-load the stack selector (%ss) from the
  IA32_STAR model specific register using the following logic:

  SS.Selector <-- (IA32_STAR[63:48]+8) OR 3; (* RPL forced to 3 *)

  Another description of the instruction behavior which shows the same
  logic in a slightly different form can also be found here:

  http://tptp.cc/mirrors/siyobik.info/instruction/SYSRET.html

  [...]
          SS(SEL) =3D IA32_STAR[63:48] + 8;
          SS(PL) =3D 0x3;
  [...]

  In other words, the value of the %ss register is supposed to be loaded
  from  bits 63:48 of the IA32_STAR model-specific register, incremented
  by 8, and then ORed with 3. ORing in the 3 sets the privilege level to
  3 (user). This is done since SYSRET returns to user mode after a
  system call.

  However, helper_sysret() in target-i386/seg_helper.c does not do the
  "OR 3" step. The code looks like this:

          cpu_x86_load_seg_cache(env, R_SS, selector + 8,
                                 0, 0xffffffff,
                                 DESC_G_MASK | DESC_B_MASK | DESC_P_MASK |
                                 DESC_S_MASK | (3 << DESC_DPL_SHIFT) |
                                 DESC_W_MASK | DESC_A_MASK);

  It should look like this:

          cpu_x86_load_seg_cache(env, R_SS, (selector + 8) | 3,
                                 0, 0xffffffff,
                                 DESC_G_MASK | DESC_B_MASK | DESC_P_MASK |
                                 DESC_S_MASK | (3 << DESC_DPL_SHIFT) |
                                 DESC_W_MASK | DESC_A_MASK);

  The code does correctly set the privilege level bits for the code
  selector register (%cs) but not for the stack selector (%ss).

  The effect of this is that when SYSRET returns control to the user-
  mode caller, %ss will be have the privilege level bits cleared. In my
  case, it went from 0x2b to 0x28. This caused a crash later: when the
  user-mode code was preempted by an interrupt, and the interrupt
  handler would do an IRET, a general protection fault would occur
  because the %ss value being loaded from the exception frame was not
  valid for user mode. (At least, I think that's what happened.)

  This behavior seems inconsistent with real hardware, and also appears
  to be wrong with respect to the Intel documentation, so I'm pretty
  confident in calling this a bug. :)

  Note that this issue seems to have been around for a long time. I
  discovered it while using QEMU 2.2.0, but I happened to have the
  sources for QEMU 0.10.5, and the problem is there too (in
  os_helper.c). I am using FreeBSD/amd64 9.1-RELEASE as my host system,
  without KVM.

  The fix is fairly simple. I'm attaching a patch which worked for me.
  Using this fix, the code that I'm testing now behaves the same on the
  QEMU virtual machine as on real hardware.
