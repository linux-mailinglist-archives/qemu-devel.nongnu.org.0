A year ago, we discussed QOM interfaces:

    Subject: Issues around TYPE_INTERFACE
    Message-ID: <87h8c82woh.fsf@dusky.pond.sub.org>

We touched naming conventions, the fact that interfaces can't have
state, how an interface type should be defined (even though it has no
state), and what it means to convert to such a type.

I'd love to see this covered in qom.rst.
