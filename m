Yeah, it is slightly different than some of the parameters handling.
I guess you could say that with disk capacity, matching size is a
fairly obvious constraint/expectation to manage, and also long standing. 

With disk capacity, you can add the 'raw' driver on top of any block
driver stack, to apply an arbitrary offset+size, to make the storage
smaller than it otherwise is on disk. Conceptually than could have
been done on the frontend device(s) too, but I guess it made more
sense to do it in the block layer to give consistent enforcement
of the limits across frontends. It is fuzzy whether such a use of
the 'raw' driver is really considered backend config,  as opposed to
frontend config but to me it feels likle frontend config.

You could possibly come up with the concept of a 'zoned' format that
can be layered on top of a block driver stack to add zoned I/O constraints
for sake of compatibility, where none otherwise exists in the physical
storage. Possibly useful if multiple frontends all support zoned storage,
to avoid duplicating the constraints across all ?

With regards,
Daniel
