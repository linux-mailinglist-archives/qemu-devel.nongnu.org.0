Does the problem happen only when the image is on APFS? when the
destination is on APFS? Neither? Try to see if it's the filesystem. Use
OSX to convert images on a non-APFS formatted external drive to see if
that improves your luck.

I'm assuming this is a duplicate of 1776920 which is still open because
we have no OSX developers willing or able to debug this problem.

Title:
  Converting qcow2 to vmdk on MacOSX results in a non-bootable image

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When using qemu-img convert -O vmdk  with version 3.1.0 or 4.0.0 on
  OSX (10.14.3) with a qcow2 image  (https://cloud-
  images.ubuntu.com/bionic/20190703/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img),
  the resulting image is not bootable.

  Running the same command on Ubuntu 18.04 results in a bootable image
  as expected
