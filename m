To summarize implications on libvirt...

This patch currently doesn't change the deprecation status of any machine
type, so it is effectively no-op metadata addition right now.

Libvirt version N can implement support for this today, and nothing would
change from a functional POV with QEMU 4.1.

At some later time, a QEMU release X.Y will mark a new machine type has
having this deprecation enabled, at which point the dormant libvirt logic
will activate, causing libvirt to use the new syntax for NUMA.


IOW, libvirt version N onwards can live migrate QEMU with machine type
pc-X.Y to a host with arbitrary future libvirt or QEMU version.

Libvirt version N-1  can *not* live migrate QEMU with machine type
pc-X.Y to a host with libvirt version N or newer.

This restriction won't be a problem in practice if there's a moderate
time window between libvirt implementing support for this concept,
and the future QEMU X.Y which actually enables the deprecation.

The main downside of this approach is the one Eduardo raised previously
which is that the dormant libvirt logic will not be testable/tested until
that QEMU X.Y actually arrives.

The testing gap is not nice, but I don't think it is sufficient to reject
this approach entirely.

I wonder if there's a way to close the testing gap somehow ? Random idea
would be a non-versioned "pc-no-deprecated" machine type, which blocks
all use of deprecated features and does not promise any migration compat.
Essentially it would exist just for testing purposem as a way todo
functional tests for libvirt & mgmt apps to prove they don't use any
deprecated features (any deprecated features, not merely this  NUMA one).
