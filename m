I don't see any reason that virtio devices can't be used by VFIO. Do you?

Actually, virtio devices have been used by VFIO for many years:

- passthrough a hardware virtio devices to userspace(VM) drivers
- using virtio PMD inside guest

Ok but having two different attributes for the same file is not good 
idea. How mgmt know there will be a 3rd type?

Well, then you will end up with a very long list to discuss. E.g for 
networking devices, you will have "mac", "v(x)lan" and a lot of other.

Note that "remote_url" is not vendor specific but NVME (class/subsystem) 
specific.

The point is that if vendor/class specific part is unavoidable, why not 
making all of the attributes vendor specific?

I'm not sure this is the correct design of uAPI. Is there something 
similar in the existing uAPIs?

And it might be hard to work for virtio devices.

It's not easy. As I said, the current design can't work for virtio 
devices and it's not hard to find other examples. I remember some Intel 
devices have bitmask based capability registers.

It depends on the type of devices. E.g for NVME, we've already had one 
(/sys/kernel/config/nvme)?
