I don't think this is a problem.

Between completion of the job and finalising it, both the base node and
the top node are equivalent. You can access either and you'll always get
the same data.

So if libvirt didn't save that the job was already completed, it will
use the old image file, and it's fine. And if libvirt already sent the
job-finalize command, it will first have saved that the job was
completed and therefore use the new image, and it's fine, too.
