I think our concepts of uAPI are different. The uAPI of read(2) and
write(2) does not define the structure of the data buffers. VFIO
device regions are exactly the same, the structure of the data is not
defined by the kernel uAPI.

Maybe microcode and firmware loading is an example we agree on?

Luckily identifying things based on magic constants has been solved
many times in the past.

A central identifier registry prevents all collisions but is a pain to
manage. Or use a 128-bit UUID and self-allocate the identifier with an
extremely low chance of collision:

Okay, I think I understand you mean now. This is the reason why vDPA exists=
