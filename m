Sorry for late response, Jiaxun, I got carried away with other things.

I am not sure, I simply don't have access to the appropriate info. at this
moment, I'd say you can keep (for now) the "ifdef"-ed code for handling
32-bit, since it will never be actually used.

But, how do you know the code is correct, if there is no doc? How do you
know about specifics of 32-bit ext? Is it just guessing, or more than that?
Mention the source of information in commit messages, if any. Or say this
is just a guess.

A short comment should be added about handling for 32-bit just before the
main functions that handle Loongson EXT, just like Richard did for those
instructions from LMMI that he could not find proper documentation.

Also, can you mention what is achieved by having EXT in QEMU? What
Longson-related scenarion would work, that previously (currently) would not=
?

Thanks for this nice series, and all valuable efforts, hopefully we will
resolve documentation issue in comming days or weeks.

Aleksandar
