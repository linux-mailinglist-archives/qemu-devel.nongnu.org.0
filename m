Depends on what you count as a layer.  I don=E2=80=99t think that=E2=80=99s=
 a clearly
defined term, is it?  I only know of =E2=80=9Cactive layer=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=
=9Cformat layer=E2=80=9D,
=E2=80=9Cprotocol layer=E2=80=9D, and you can at least have multiple format=
 layers above
each other.  So I don=E2=80=99t find it counterintuitive.

But perhaps it=E2=80=99d be best to just get away from the term =E2=80=9Cac=
tive layer=E2=80=9D,
as you propose below.

Ah, yeah...

I=E2=80=99m all for spelling it out more explicitly.  I just noticed that I
couldn=E2=80=99t clearly distinguish =E2=80=9Cactive layer=E2=80=9D from =
=E2=80=9Cother=E2=80=9D cases of nodes
with writers on them, which is why I noted that =E2=80=9Cactive=E2=80=9D to=
 me means the
post-patch behavior already.

You=E2=80=99re right that there is no semantic reason for making it an erro=
r.
So I just want it to be an error to be lazy.  I hope you let me do that.
 (I don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=99s much of a problem with it, consider=
ing that
commits on nodes that have the WRITE permission taken are basically just
completely broken right now.)

> "If 'top' doesn't have an overlay image or is in use by a writer..."?

I.e., avoiding the term =E2=80=9Cactive layer=E2=80=9D altogether?  Sounds =
good.  Only,
I don=E2=80=99t know about =E2=80=9Cwriter=E2=80=9D...  But it=E2=80=99s al=
ready used in
BlockdevOptionsFile.dynamic-auto-read-only=E2=80=99s description, so I supp=
ose
we can use it here, too.  (I just don=E2=80=99t know if as a
non-block-layer-developer I=E2=80=99d know what it means.)

(Also, yes, you=E2=80=99re right, the current behavior of giving all root n=
odes
an active commit of course remains, even when there are no writers.)

Sure.  So I understand you agree with moving the whole chunk, right?
