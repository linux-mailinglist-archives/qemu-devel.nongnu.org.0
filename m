Yes, when you actually need the pointer.  Common, but not universal.

Yes, that's a drawback.

Only if we value the consistency more than the update labor and churn.

The conventions I described only apply to error checking.  I certainly
don't mean to discourage things like

    while (*p && qemu_isspace(*p)) {
        p++;
    }

Also, they're *conventions*, not law.  The purpose of conventions is to
help us write clearer code.  Don't make code less clear just to conform
to a convention.  Use your judgement.

Perfectly consistent error checking style, idiomatic C, pick one.

The conventions I described apply to error checking, regardless of Error
object use.  For instance, they'd apply to error-checking
remove("some-file").
