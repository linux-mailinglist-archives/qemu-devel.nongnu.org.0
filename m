We've not said whether this refers to only base repos, or whether addon
repos are accepted. IMHO, we are reasonably justified in saying RHEL-7
as a build platform covers any repo provided by Red Hat, which would
give us Python3 via software collections. I think it would be reasonable
to also state it covers EPEL, since EPEL is such a commonly used repo
with RHEL.

IOW, I don't think RHEL-7 support as a build platform blocks us from
dropping py2. We merely need to tweak our build platforms doc to clarify
our intent wrt add-on yum repos.

Daniel
