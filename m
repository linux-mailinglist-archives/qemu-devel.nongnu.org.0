yep that is what i would prefer to see too.

yes i really dont like haveing the version in the mdev-type name 
i would stongly perfger just qat-type-1 wehere qat is just there as a way of namespacing.
although symmetric-cryto, asymmetric-cryto and compression woudl be a better name then type-1, type-2, type-3 if
that is what they would end up mapping too. e.g. qat-compression or qat-aes is a much better name then type-1
higher layers of software are unlikely to parse the mdev names but as a human looking at them its much eaiser to
understand if the names are meaningful. the qat prefix i think is important however to make sure that your mdev-types
dont colide with other vendeors mdev types. so i woudl encurage all vendors to prefix there mdev types with etiher the
device name or the vendor.
