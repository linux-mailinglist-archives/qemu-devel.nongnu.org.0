Sorry, I was on holiday and then jury service, so I missed any chance at 
getting this into -rc3.  The memory leak only happens on failure, and 
you'd have to be pretty desperate to purposefully attempt to open a lot 
of NBD devices where you know you'll get a failure just to trigger 
enough of a leak to cause the OOM-killer to target qemu.  So I'm fine if 
this is deferred to 5.0, and just cc's qemu-stable (now done).

I'll queue this through my NBD tree for 5.0.

I'm not one to tell you that your name is written incorrectly, but it 
does look odd to have a single word rather than a space between two 
capitalized portions.  If that's really how you want your S-o-b and 
authorship to appear, I'm happy to preserve it; but you may want to 
consider updating your git settings, and posting a v4 with an updated 
spelling if you would prefer something different.  (It is also 
acceptable to use UTF-8 characters; some people like listing an S-o-b in 
both native characters and a Westernized variant).

Yes, information like that helps in deciding how long the problem has 
been present (in this case, it is indeed a regression added in 4.2, even 
if minor in nature).
