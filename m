QMP is JSON (no almost).  It accepts single-quoted strings as an
extension (but does not produce them).  This is permitted by the RFC.
We can get rid of the extension if it irks us.

There's also the QMP-generating language in the template string of
qobject_from_jsonf_nofail() & friends.  Helps keeping C code readable.
This template language is definitely not JSON (not even almost).

I occasionally paste schema bits into Python (working around the
true/false issue), for quick ad hoc hackery, where hooking into the real
frontend would be overkill.

Anything more advanced than that would be a bad idea, in my opinion.
Use the real frontend.

Correct.

With decent string syntax, the doc comment blocks could be turned into
strings.  But then we'd parse the strings instead, so no real change.

query-qmp-schema is for introspecting QMP.  It tells you what *this*
build of QEMU's QMP can do.  The schema tells you what QMP can do in
*any* build of this version of QEMU, and more.

To introspect QMP, process output of query-qmp-schema.

To work with the QAPI schema, interface with the frontend from
scripts/qapi/.

Yup.  "IDL for QMP" is just one aspect of QAPI.
