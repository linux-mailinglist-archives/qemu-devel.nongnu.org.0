That seems wrong to me.  Why not use qemu-img convert for this case?

Attaching an NBD server to a compressed disk has exactly the same
problem as attaching a compressed disk to a VM.  It won=E2=80=99t work unle=

the client/guest is aware of the limitations.

What seems wrong to me is that this series just adds a generic compress
option without ensuring that it works generically.

Either (1) it only works in well-defined cases, then either (1A) we have
to ensure that we only allow it then (as we do now, because only
qemu-img convert and the backup job have such an option; and those two
are safe), or (1B) we have to clearly give a big warning for the new
option that it doesn=E2=80=99t work correctly.  I don=E2=80=99t know whethe=
r such a
warning is even possible with just a generic node-level option.

Or (2) we make it work in generic cases.  Well, that might be possible
for qcow2, but who=E2=80=99s going to make it work for VMDK=E2=80=99s strea=
mOptimized
subformat?

More on all of that below.

Based on the assumption that one shouldn=E2=80=99t attach a compressed disk=
 to a
VM, I don=E2=80=99t see how streaming makes sense then.  Well, I suppose
intermediate streaming would work.

> - backup with compression (we have an optional already, so it works)

The problem is clearly that if a generic client were to connect to the
NBD server, it wouldn=E2=80=99t work.  In this case, compression will work =
only
if the clients understands the limitation.

(The safe way would be to make the NBD server provide an option that
clients can see so they know this limitation and agree they=E2=80=99ll adhe=
re to
it.  It=E2=80=99s also a stupid way.)

I don=E2=80=99t know.  It doesn=E2=80=99t work generically, so I don=E2=80=
=99t know whether it
should be a generic option.

How so?  compress=3Don only works if every party involved only writes to
any cluster of the image exactly once.  That is just not the case for
guests unless they know this limitation, and even I don=E2=80=99t see a use=
 case.

It seems wrong to not compress data with compress=3Don.

> (Note, that in case with stream we rewrite only unallocated clusters)

Yes, but if the stream job writes the cluster before the guest, the
guest gets an I/O error.


By the way, the other thing I wondered was whether this should be a
filter driver instead (if it makes sense at all).  Such a filter driver
would at least be sufficiently cumbersome to use that probably only
users who understand the implications would make use of it (1B above).


I=E2=80=99m not against adding a generic compress=3Don option if we ensure =
that it
actually works generically (2 above).  It doesn=E2=80=99t right now, so I d=
on=E2=80=99t
think this is right.

I=E2=80=99m already not sure whether it=E2=80=99s really possible to suppor=
t generic
compressed writes in qcow2.  I suppose it=E2=80=99d be at least awkward.  I=
n
theory it should work, it=E2=80=99s just that we can=E2=80=99t keep track o=
f subcluster
allocations, which in the worst case means that some compressed clusters
take up a whole cluster of space.

For VMDK...  I suppose we could consider a new flag for block drivers
that flags whether a driver supports arbitrary compressed writes or has
the old limitations.  compress=3Don could then refuse to work on any block
driver but the ones that support arbitrary compressed writes.


Our current model (1A) is simply to ensure that all compressed writes
can adhere to the limitations.  As I=E2=80=99ve said above, extending this =
to
NBD would mean adding some NBD negotiation so both client and server
agree on this limitation.  That seems kind of reasonable from the qemu
side, but probably very unreasonable from an NBD side.  Why would NBD
bother to reproduce qemu=E2=80=99s limitations?


So these are the three ways (1A, 1B, 2) I can imagine.  But just adding
a generic option that unsuspecting users are not unlikely to use but
that simply doesn=E2=80=99t work generically doesn=E2=80=99t seem right to =
me.
