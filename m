The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Qemu PPC64 kvm no display if  --device virtio-gpu-pci is selected

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,
  i did many tests on qemu 2.8 on my BE machines and i found an issue that =
i think was need to be reported

  Test Machines BE 970MP

  if i setup qemu with

  qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display sdl(or gtk),gl=3Don --device virtio-
  gpu-pci,virgl --enable-kvm and so and so

  result is doubled window one is vga other is virtio-gpu-pci without
  any start of the VM . pratically i dont have any output of openbios
  and on the virtual serial output

  the same issue i found is if i select:
  qemu-system-ppc64 -M 1024 --display gtk(or sdl) --device virtio-gpu-pci -=
-enable-kvm and so and so

  =

  i had been try to change all the -M types of all kind of pseries without =
any positive result.

  Ciao =

  Luigi
