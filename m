The point is this:  Consider 'write -P 0xff 0 64k', then 'write -z 16k 
16k', then 'read 0 64k'.  For normal clusters, we can just do a 
scatter-gather iov read of read 0-16k and 32-64k, plus a memset of 
16-32k.  But for compressed clusters, we have to read and decompress the 
entire 64k, AND also memset 16k-32k.  But if zeroing after reading is 
not that expensive, then the same technique for normal clusters is fine 
(instead of a scatter-gather read of 48k, just read the whole 64k 
cluster before doing the memset).  So the question at hand is not what 
happens in writing, but in reading, and whether we are penalizing reads 
from a compressed cluster or even from regular clusters, when reading 
from a cluster where subclusters have different status.
