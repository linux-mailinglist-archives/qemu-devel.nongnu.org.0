Interesting idea.

RECORDER_DEFINE specifies a text that is listed when you pass "help" as a
trace name. There is no equivalent concept that I'm aware of in the existin=
g
qemu trace infrastructure.

Well, for the recorder it's a slightly different problem. When you do a
recorder post-mortem dump, entries are sorted and printed at that time. THi=
s
makes it possible to have a number of recent traces for high-frequency
events, as well as some much older traces for low-frequency events.

For example, you can have a buffer that records command-line options, and
another that records events that occur typically once per second, and yet
another that records high-frequency events. Then, when your program crashes
and you look at a dump, you see a context that includes both recent
high-frequency stuff as well as much older low-frequency events.

See https://gitlab.com/c3d/recorder for examples.

Yes, but it's much more complicated than this simple patch series ;-) As is=

the goal of this series is to not touch any other back-end.

Sure, but this is also touching the rest of the tracing infrastructure,
which was a definite non-goal for this specific series.
