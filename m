I think it's better not limit to the kernel interface for a specific use 
case. This is basically the device introspection.

This is probably another call for devlink base interface.

That's total vendor specific I think. If "v2+" means it only support a 
version 2+, we can introduce fields like min_version and max_version. 
But again, the point is to let such interfaces vendor specific instead 
of trying to have a generic format.

Why? Can we simply do:

1) Src support feature A, B, C  (version 1.0)
2) Dst support feature A, B, C, D (version 2.0)
3) only enable feature A, B, C in destination in a version specific way 
(set version to 1.0)
4) migrate metadata A, B, C

If we've already exposed the capability, there's no need for an extra 
check like compatibility string.
