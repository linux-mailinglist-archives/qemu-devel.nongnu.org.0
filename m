I tried kernel build in guest.

I took a look into this link, hope my understanding is correct.

You concern is this thread/patch is based on one prerequisite -- dirty all the
bitmap at start.

My answer is we already did it in ram_block_add() for each RAMBlock. And then
the bitmap is synced by migration_bitmap_sync_precopy() from
ram_list.dirty_memory to RAMBlock.bmap.
