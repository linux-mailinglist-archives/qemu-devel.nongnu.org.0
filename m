IMO it's fine to not support 32-bit for now.

And that's exciting to hear! Really looking forward to that.

I may formed the question ambiguously; I'm actually interested in what 
kernel flavor qemu will support emulating, not what qemu runs on. IIUC 
qemu will compile and run fine on both old-world and new-world systems. 
But anyway, we'll find out when your code is out for review.

Thanks for the clarification. Indeed focusing on new-world should be the 
right way to go, adding old-world compatibility later if possible. I 
fear adding compatibility too early would result in a franken-port not 
serving either world well nor maintainable.
