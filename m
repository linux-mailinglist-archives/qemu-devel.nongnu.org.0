Well, this could be made problem of the caller by skipping any newly
allocated sectors to be written to the bitmap. The caller then can
decide whether a snapshot of the allocation map is needed and thus a new
inactive bitmap should be used as the destination, or whether new writes
should be tracked by using an active bitmap.

Given the semantics above this would conveniently not be a problem of
the population job. If you create a snapshot of the allocation map any
any point we'd care about that state.

Anyways, from the point of view of the bitmap code any write to a sector
sets the bit so the trimming should not be treated differently.

Speicifically libvirt plans to use it on overlay(snapshot) images where
the btimaps are not present so in that case even trimmed sectors need to
mask the data in the backing image so they can technically be considered
as allocated too.
