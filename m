As discussed on IRC, I'm not a big fan of moving QMP tests that don't
make use of the qtest protocol at all to C unit tests (nothing in
drive_del_test makes use of the qtest protocol, neither before nor after
this patch). It's generally harder to write this kind of tests in C than
in Python, and assertion based tests are harder to debug than reference
output based ones.

There is one argument why this should be a qtest, which is that qtests
are run for multitple guest architectures while iotests run only for the
first architecture we found. I'm not sure if it's a good argument, but I
can't completely dismiss it.

The commit message should mention this argument, though.

In the future, I think iotests should be extended to provide the
necessary infrastructure to run tests on several architectures, and then
this should be converted to a Python iotest.

Please keep a comment that 067 shouldn't be reused, like we do for some
other cases. (It only causes merge conflicts for downstreams.)

067 tested reset and query-block after this. Is the removal intentional?

Other than these, the conversion looks correct. I'm not convinced that
doing it is a step in the right direction, but with these two things
fixed, you can add:
