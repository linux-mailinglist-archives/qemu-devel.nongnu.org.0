I think it makes sense to make GitLab be the canonical location for
all the GIT repos that QEMU project hosts, and everything else be a
read-only mirror.

With the current mixed setup both qemu.org and gitlab.com are failure
points which impact us. This is bad because while gitlab.com has
scalable redundant hardware with dedicated sysadmins, qemu.org is a
single VM, with part time sysadmins, and no failover facility if the
VM fails.

By making gitlab.com primary, any problems with qemu.org no longer
have a blocking impact on us.
