(v2 for =E2=80=9Cblock: Let blockdev-create return 0 on success=E2=80=9D)

Jobs are expected to return 0 on success, so this extends to
.bdrv_co_create().  After some inspection, it turns out that vpc is the
only block driver that may return a positive value instead (to indicate
success).  Fix that.

Without this patch, blockdev-create is likely to fail for VPC images.
Hence patch 5.

John indicated his preference for me to use iotests.script_main().  I
did that; but I still wanted to retain some form of verify_protocol().
Patch 2 adds @supported_protocols to execute_test() (and thus to
iotests.script_main() and iotests.main()).  Then I noticed we should
probably make all Python tests (that use either script_main() or main())
pass something for that parameter, because it=E2=80=99s a bit silly to ru=
n all
Python tests for raw when you just want to run the nbd tests (which are
five or so).  Enter patches 3 and 4.

(There are two Python tests (093 and 136) which I didn=E2=80=99t change t=
o pass
supported_protocols, because they use null-{co,aio} as their protocol.
As these are not actually testee protocols for the iotests, I decided to
just keep running these tests for any protocol.)


For completeness=E2=80=99 sake[1]:
