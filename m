Good that you like it! :-)

What exactly do you mean?  This is not a block driver, so it doesn=E2=80=99=
t
work as part of -blockdev.  Currently, it can only be used through QMP
(fuse-export-add/fuse-export-remove).

I placed it into block/ because that just seemed like the least bad
place to me (apart from creating a new top-level directory like nbd has)
=E2=80=93 and also because we already have quite some few non-driver files =
in
block/ (io.c, the jobs (where some got drivers only rather recently),
accounting.c, ...).
