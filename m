The status of the feature support in the guest can change.  E.g. a guest
reboot will clear it for certain, and the guest may boot into another OS
that doesn't support pv-pt failover, and will become confused by two
network devices with the same MAC.  AFAICS from a brief skimming, the
patchset doesn't appear to address this scenario (which is probably not
so uncommon).

Frankly I'm failing to see the point in requiring 100%-reliable re-plug
on migration rollback.  The whole idea of this failover is to allow
temporary QOS degradation; if this isn't allowed you don't even consider
migrating.  So if the migration fails, you can leave the guest in the
degraded state on the source host until a better migraion target is
found or the conditions on the source host allow the re-plug to succeed.

Thanks,
Roman.
