Title:
  GTK display zoom in, zooms infinitely

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The zoom in feature in the "View" menu of the gtk frontend (launch
  qemu with -display gtk), seems to be very broken.

  If I hit the zoom in feature, it first zooms in.

  Then, it zooms in again.

  Every subsequent second that passes, it zooms in again, until it
  eventually eats up too much host resources and freezes the host
  desktop.

  I have seen this with 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-8~deb10u1), and also
  with a locally built 4.0, My colleague also confirms having seen the
  issue with 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3.1+dfsg-8).
