Title:
  Fails to start on Windows host without explicit --disable-pie

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Since commit d2cd29e30736afd4a1e8cac3cf4da360bbc65978, which removed
  the x86 conditional around PIE, QEMU completely fails to start on a
  Windows host unless --disable-pie is explicitly given at build time.
  Even just requesting the help text doesn't work. To make testing
  easier, this can be replicated with Wine.
