The primary purpose of the recorder is post-mortem dumps, flight recorder
style. Tracing is only a secondary benefit. Not sure if it's worth making a
distinction between events you want to record and those you want to trace.
(Example: You might want to record all command line options, but almost
never trace them)

Let me think more about integrating these features with other trace
backends. See below for short-term impact.

- Grouping, as indicated above, mostly useful in practice to make selection
  of tracing topics easy (e.g. "modules") but also for real-time graphing,
  because typically a state change occurs in different functions, which is
  why I used locking as an example.

- Self-documentation. Right now, the recorder back-end generates rather
  unhelpful help messages.

- Trace buffer size. This is important to make post-mortem dumps usable if
  you record infrequent events alongside much higher-rate ones. For example=
,
  you may want a large buffer to record info about command-line option
  processing, the default 8 is definitely too small.

- Support for %+s, which tells that a string is safe to print later (e.g. i=
t
  is a compile-time constant, or never ever freed).

- Support for custom formats, e.g. I use %v in the XL compiler for LLVM
  value pointers. This is a bit more advanced, but it would be neat to be
  able to print out QOM objects using %q :-)

For the short term, what about providing trace-named wrappers around these
additional recorder features?
