I think this actually confirms that this is the right direction. If we
are going to have a range of different implementations then we want
them to all use the same basic framework. In this case that would be
GPIO lines.

Yes, that's entirely possible. The hard part is adding the logic to
the CPU to trigger that line. For standard extensions that is
something we can do, but adding functionality like that for vendor
specific extensions becomes tricky.

Yeah, I agree. Overall I think it's a good concept, and straight
forward to implement. The hard part is doing it in a generic way.
