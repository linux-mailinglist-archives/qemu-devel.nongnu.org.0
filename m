Ah, I missed that.

Yeah, I think that'd make sense, as it'd enable a simple trick we
do in libvirt.

In all the dockerfile recipe we set an env

  ENV MESON_OPTS "--cross-file=/usr/share/mingw/toolchain-mingw32.meson"

And in other linux-cross builds, we do similar

  ENV MESON_OPTS "--cross-file=i686-linux-gnu"

So now from host side can just invoke  "meson $MESON_OPTS" and it will
do the right thing according to whatever the container image was
installed with, regardless of whether it is a cross, or native build.

This obviously only works if you have separate images for win32
and win64.

I'd suggest that "make installer" should be a part of "make" not
a separate thing that needs running manually.

eg if we're configure'ing for mingw, configure should check whether
we have the NSIS tools available and if so, then enable NSIS as a
standard build output. We could have a configure option to enable/disable
NSIS explicitly.

This  eliminates the second bit of special casing for mingw

Yes, dropping test-mingw would be better, but I'm not sure you can
use 'test-quick' as that runs unit tests which would require wine
to be present.  'test-build' would be closer to what test-mingw
does.

Anyway, if the images and make rules are created & setup in a suitable
way, there should be no need to do anything special in the host side
for cross-builds - just pick the image you want and it should "just work".

Regards,
Daniel
