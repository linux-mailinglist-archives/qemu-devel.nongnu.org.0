I did raise similar complaints at that patch series and proposed several 
alternatives to preserve the previous functionality (sam460ex wasn't the 
only board that fixed up memory size for users) but since current APIs 
don't support that and adding this extra feature for just this machine 
wasn't a priority, my comments were accepted and ignored and I did not 
feel it would be fair to hold back the whole series for this.

I think I've explained how it worked and how it should work in my opinion 
and hope this could be revived at some point when the QEMU CLI will be 
made more user friendly (if ever) but I'm not willing to fight for that 
now. Silence in this case does not mean agreement but I see no point 
arguing if you cannot be convinced.

Just one point I'd like to keep is that no matter how you fix it the board 
code should be the only one that decides if the error is recoverable or 
not so don't abort or assert from this helper but return error to board 
code and exit from there so it has a chnace to recover in the furure or 
add "magic function" to help users wihtout having to touch this helper 
again. When you're touching the helper it would be nice to also try to 
convert the remaining two machines with hard coded SPD data so the final 
function is truely covering all current users of the function.
