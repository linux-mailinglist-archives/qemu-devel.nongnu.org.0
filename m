&gt; Thank you for looking into this, Peter. I agree that static analysis h=

The thing is, you&#39;re making us do all the work here. That&#39;s<br>
not very useful to us. It&#39;s doubly unuseful when there&#39;s<br>
a strong chance that when we do do the work of looking<br>
at the code it turns out that there&#39;s no problem.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did some static analysis, and I looked at the<br>
results, and I dug through the QEMU code, and it<br>
does seem to me that this could well be a bug&quot; is<br>
definitely useful. &quot;I did some static analysis using<br>
only analysis techniques that have an pretty<br>
low false positive rate, and here is a selection of<br>
the results&quot; is also useful. But &quot;I just ran the<br>
code through an analyser that produces lots of<br>
false positives and then I didn&#39;t do any further<br>
human examination of the results&quot; is of much less<br>
utility to the project, I&#39;m afraid.<br>
<br>
&gt; For the first case, I noticed a check on offset (if (offset)) before n=
egating it and passing to stream function here.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Similar scenario happened here WITHOUT the check:<br>
&gt; <a href=3D"https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/c532b954d96f96d361ca31308=

<br>
So, this is in the disassembler. The difference is<br>
just whether we print out a register+offset memory<br>
reference where the offset happens to be zero<br>
as &quot;[reg, #0]&quot; or just &quot;[reg]&quot;, and the no-special-case=
-0<br>
is for encodings which are always pc-relative.<br>
So even if it was a missing check the results are<br>
entirely harmless, since anybody reading the disassembly<br>
will understand the #0 fine.<br>
<br>
Secondly, this code is imported from binutils,<br>
so we usually don&#39;t worry too much about fixing<br>
up minor bugs in it.<br>
<br>
Finally, I went and checked the Arm specs, and for<br>
the kinds of PC-relative load/store that the second<br>
example is handling the specified disassembly format<br>
does mandate the &quot;pc, #0&quot; (whereas the other example<br>
is correctly skipping it for 0-immediates because<br>
in those insns the offset is optional in disassembly).<br>
<br>
So the code is correct as it stands.<br>
<br>
