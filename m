Personally I'm a fan of automated code formatters that can enforce a
specific style, so no objection from me.

I've not looked at black in any detail, but if its focused on code
style, then there might be a few bits from flake8 that are still
useful, such as checking for unused imports, or unresolved variable
names. Then again, perhaps Jon's pylint stuff will already catch
that.
