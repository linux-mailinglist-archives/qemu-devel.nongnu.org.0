Hi John,

Sorry I'm re-sending this mail due to format issue in the last one.

This issue can only be reproduced on Windows 10.
I've observed and compared the behavior of Windows 10 and Windows 7.
It seems Windows 7 wouldn't disable the PCI_COMMAND_MASTER flag
when disabling ahci devices. That's why this issue won't happen on Win7.

Here's the trace log on both guest OS, on disabling and re-engaging SATA=20
disk:
