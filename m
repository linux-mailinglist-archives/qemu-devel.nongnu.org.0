Just to reiterate what others have previously stated:

The granularity in MAINTAINERS and how it is organized does not really
work well with what you are trying to do with this classification.

If I pick just this entry as an example: It covers *all* s390x-related
code, and this covers both things like support for protected
virtualization (definitely critical) and virtio-9p-ccw (definitely not
critical). It is important that somebody is looking after s390x overall
(hence the "Supported" state), but not all s390x-related code is
equally critical.

I see the main purpose of the MAINTAINERS file to find the right
contacts for an area; other approaches like tagging of devices and
features seem to be better suited for figuring out which areas are
deemed critical.
