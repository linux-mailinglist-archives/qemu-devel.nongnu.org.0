Looking at glib codebase, I don't see 'self' used all that
widely or consistently - much of gio/ uses an abbreviation
of the object type as the variable name.

For me the first "sniff test" for a new coding style guideline is
whether QEMU actually follows the rule to any significant extent
already. If not, then I think the benefit would have to be very
significant to justify defining it as a rule. We've historically
be quite reluctant to do bulk updates of existing code to apply
new coding styles. Without planning a bulk update, you end up
with a coding style that is followed by 1% of the code and ignored
by the other 99%.

As noted above, the common case in QEMU is for the variable to be an
abbreviation of the type name. The number of places using "*self" is
almost single digits. So I think the idea of standardizing on "self"
is already questionable for QEMU.


I think the reason for the current pattern of abbreviated type name
is that when we're inventing OOP features in C the impl of inheritance
is always sub-optimal, such that you frequently find a need to cast to
parent types.  So in any single method it is common to have multiple
variables all refering to the object "self", each cast to a different
type. To pick one simple example

    QIOChannelFile fioc =3D qio_channel_file_new(...)
    QIOChannel *ioc =3D QIO_CHANNEL(fioc)
    Object *obj =3D OBJECT(fioc)

    qio_channel_read_all(ioc, buf, len, erro);
    object_unref(obj);


I think that using the object type abbreviation for the variable name
is a good thing.  Arbitrarily picking "self" for one of those variables
is unhelpful, as you have to then look back to the declaration of "self"
to remind yourself whether "self" is an QOIChannelFile or a QIOChannel
or an Object.


Constrast with C++ / Java, where I think the use of "self" is a good
thing, because the language has built-in  OOP concepts, such that
you can call a method on any parent class without having to first
cast "self" to the parent type. IOW, in those languages you don't
have to care about the particular types in the class hierarchy when
operating on "self".  This isn't true of C / QEMU's QOM.

Daniel
