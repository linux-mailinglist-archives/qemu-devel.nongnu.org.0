It's closer to idea than to suggestion, and it's separate.

Commit message in my tree:

    nbd: assert that Error** is not NULL in nbd_iter_channel_error
   =20
    All callers of nbd_iter_channel_error() pass the address of a
    local_err variable, and only call this function if an error has
    already occurred, using this function to propagate that error.
    This is already implied by its name (local_err instead of the classic
    errp), but it is worth additionally stressing this by adding an
    assertion to make it part of the function contract.
   =20
    The local_err parameter is not here to return information about
    nbd_iter_channel_error failure. Instead it's assumed to be filled when
    passed to the function. This is already stressed by its name
    (local_err, instead of classic errp). Stress it additionally by
    assertion.
