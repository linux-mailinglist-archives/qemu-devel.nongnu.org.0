Could you elaborate on this?=20

Inside the same process several users can access that luks node at the same
time while one of them changes encryption keys, since this doesn't affect I=
O of the data.

Two users in same process I was *I think* told that can't do the amend in t=
he same time
since qmp is protected with a lock. However since I use a block job (to be =
consistent with blockdev-create)
I wonder if several qmp amend commands couldn't race one with another. Thes=
e jobs is running
on the block device AIO context (I changed this recently after a review), b=
ut stil I am not sure
there can't be a race.

And when there is access to the same image from multiple processes, I do ha=
ve a test that
checks that as long as more that one process has the image open, noone can =
change the encryption keys
(this is only relevant for raw luks format, since for qcow2 this is forbidd=
en anyway).

I probably missed something though.

Best regards,
=09Maxim Levitsky
