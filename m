Can you elaborate on this function signature rules here ? Is this referring
to scenarios where you cast between 2 different function prototypes ?

I'm wondering if this applies to the way GLib's main loop source callbacks
are registered.

eg the g_source_set_callback method takes a callback with a signature
of "GSourceFunc" which is

  gboolean (*)(void *)

but the way GSources are implemented means that each implementation gets
to define its own custom callback signature. So for example, in QIOChannel
we use

  int (*)(struct QIOChannel *, enum <anonymous>,  void *)

Thus, we always have an intentional bad function cast when invoking the
g_source_set_callback method.

GCC is able to warn about these if we add -Wcast-function-type, but we
don't do that because these bad casts are intentional.

eg

io/channel.c: In function ‘qio_channel_add_watch_full’:
io/channel.c:315:35: error: cast between incompatible function types from ‘QIOChannelFunc’ {aka ‘int (*)(struct QIOChannel *, enum <anonymous>,  void *)’} to ‘gboolean (*)(void *)’ {aka ‘int (*)(void *)’} [-Werror=cast-function-type]
  315 |     g_source_set_callback(source, (GSourceFunc)func, user_data, notify);
      |                                   ^
io/channel.c: In function ‘qio_channel_wait’:
io/channel.c:507:27: error: cast between incompatible function types from ‘gboolean (*)(QIOChannel *, GIOCondition,  void *)’ {aka ‘int (*)(struct QIOChannel *, enum <anonymous>,  void *)’} to ‘gboolean (*)(void *)’ {aka ‘int (*)(void *)’} [-Werror=cast-function-type]
  507 |                           (GSourceFunc)qio_channel_wait_complete,
      |                           ^
