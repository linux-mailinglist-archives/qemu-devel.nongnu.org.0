What about an optional ->filter() callback? That would be invoked if
existing prior to calling the child_foreach callback and could be used
to exclude children from the reset for this round for all callbacks. Or
have it modify the reset type (like in your pci reset -> cold reset
example above), and completely skip it if the reset type has been
modified to a 'no reset' type?
