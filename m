Currently I only found the io_submit() will block while I/O pressure
is too high, for details, see:

	https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/c6d75e49-3e36-6a76-fdc8-cdf09e7c3393@huawei.com/

io_submit can not ensure non-blocking at any time.

We cannot ensure that everything is non-blocking in iothread, because
some actions seems like asynchronous but will block in some times (such
as io_submit).  Anyway, the _timeout() API can make these qmp commands
(which need to get aio_context) be safer.

Thanks,
Zhenyu
