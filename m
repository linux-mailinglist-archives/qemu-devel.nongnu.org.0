My bad. Can't imagine why I called its impl add_graphics_client
but then made it work for graphics clients and chardevs all
the way back in day 1.

Ordinarily a client will directly connect() to QEMU to setup the
socket connection. Depending on the protocol this may involve both
TLS negotiation and authentication. This is a good thing when exposed
over a public IP address. It is tedious when connecting from a local
client though.

The idea behind the 'add_client' method was to enable short circuiting
of encryption and authentication, for local only clients. For example,
virt-viewer/virt-manager can do socketpair() and pass one of the FDs
across to QEMU, and bypass any VNC authentication. This is still secure,
as FD passing is mediated by libvirt which the app has already
authenticated against.

This is conceptually useful for any backend exposed as a network
socket, accepting ad-hoc client connections. So it is in scope for
chardevs, nbd, vnc, spice.

I notice another flaw for chardevs though - we're ignoring thue
'skipauth' parameter, so we're failing to skip TLS on chardevs
should anyone try to use this.

With regards,
Daniel
