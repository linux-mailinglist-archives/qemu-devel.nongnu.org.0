Because the problem is that existing users are not aware of that.

If they were, they could simply create a COR filter already.

I suppose we could interpret the deprecation policy in a way that we
could change the behavior of -drive copy-on-read=3Don, but as I already
said, what=E2=80=99s the point of supporting -drive copy-on-read=3Don, wh=
en you
can simply explicitly create a COR filter on top?

That optional parameter exists, and if it is given, the user shows that
they are aware of the node.  Hence the node becomes explicit then.

The problem is with legacy users that use an existing interface and
suddenly the externally visible interface of qemu changes in a way that
could break them.  I suppose additional entries in
query-named-block-nodes is not breakage.  Maybe it is, that would be a
bug then.

(If nobody has noticed so far, that may be because these legacy
applications didn=E2=80=99t use query-named-block-nodes.  But now maybe l=
ibvirt
does, and so if we converted copy-on-read=3Don to a COR node, it would
notice now and thus break.  So just because our handling of implicit
nodes is broken right now does not mean we can abandon the concept
altogether.)

No.  Depends on the node.

That was always the most difficult question we had when we introduced
filters.

The problem is that we never answered it in our code base.

One day, we just added filters (=E2=80=9Clet=E2=80=99s see what happens=E2=
=80=9D), and in the
beginning, they were all explicit, so we still didn=E2=80=99t have to ans=
wer
this question (in code).  Then job filters were added, and we still
didn=E2=80=99t have to, because they set blockers so the graph couldn=E2=80=
=99t be
reorganized with them in place anyway.

If we converted copy-on-read=3Don to a COR node, we would have to answer
that question.

 this mess..

Yeah, well, that is nothing new at all.  For example, note the =E2=80=9CS=
plit
I/O throttling off into own BDS =E2=80=93 Requires some care with snapsho=
ts
etc.=E2=80=9D here:
https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/Block#Dynamic_graph_reconfiguration_.28e.g._ad=
ding_block_filters.2C_taking_snapshots.2C_etc..29

This was always a problem.  It was always the biggest problem with
filters.  We never answered it because it never become an acute problem,
as I described above.

We just said =E2=80=9CFor explicit filters, they just stay where they are=
, and
that=E2=80=99s OK because the user can take care of them.=E2=80=9D  We ne=
ver did add the
implicit filters that were actually going to become a problem (COR and
throttle).

So as I said above, the behavior of implicit nodes needs to be examined
on a case-by-case basis.  Well, actually, this is only about COR and
throttle, really, and both would behave the same: Always stay at the
BlockBackend, because that is the behavior when you currently use
BB-level throttling or COR.

The jobs that now use implicit nodes freeze the graph, so there is no
problem there.

(Also, by the way, we do not need the option to give COR/throttle nodes
created through BB options a node name.  As I said above, at that point
you can just create the node yourself.)

> 1. If you something around filenames don't work, use node-names, and be=
tter
> don't use filename-based APIs

I think we agree that filename-based APIs were a mistake.  (Though only
in hindsight.  They were added when there where no node names, so it did
make sense then.)

So now you should not use them, correct.

> 2. If you qemu-img can't do what you need, use paused qemu process, and=
 better,
> don't use qemu-img

There was always a plan to give qemu-img feature parity to qemu proper.
 But often the interface is just a problem.  Node names really don=E2=80=99=
t
make much sense with qemu-img, I think.

(I mean, feel free to add something that automatically names the backing
nodes e.g. backing.0, backing.1, etc., and then add an interface to
qemu-img commit to use node names, but I find that weird.)

So I don=E2=80=99t quite see the problem.  Of course qemu has more functi=
onality
than qemu-img.  qemu-img is fine as long as you have a simple set-up,
but once it gets more complicated, you need management software; and
that software shouldn=E2=80=99t care much whether it uses qemu-img or qem=
u itself.

Uh, yeah?  I don=E2=80=99t see the problem here.

This is like saying =E2=80=9CIf I want to use new features, I should use
-blockdev and not -hda=E2=80=9D.  Yes, that is correct.  You should set
filter-node-name if you care about the exact state of the graph.

For all filters that the user has no other way of creating them, yes.
(That is, the filters created by the block jobs.)

Guest flushes are about clearing the cache and keeping the disk state
consistent in case of e.g. power failure.  So if the target should be
consistent, it too should then survive a power failure.

Hm, but then again, if we don=E2=80=99t enforce on the host that the targ=
et is
always flushed before the source, that consistency is quickly lost when
the host decides to flush the cache just because it wants to.

Hmmm.  I guess we could say that the target is always inconsistent on
e.g. power failure.

My problem is that the target is also, well, a backup, you know.  So
it=E2=80=99s kind of a pain if we don=E2=80=99t care about it.  The user =
probably wanted
to save that old data, and now it may be lost just because we didn=E2=80=99=
t
flush it when the user entered =E2=80=9Csync=E2=80=9D in the VM.  I don=E2=
=80=99t know.
