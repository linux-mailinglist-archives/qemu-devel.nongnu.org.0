How is that extraction rate is slower but total time is less than without 
hardfloat? There must be other factors here than just FP ops. Maybe a 
better test is to not play the audio just save it to a file so other 
issues with USB is not influencing the test.

So probably there are at least two problems: FPU emulation is not fast 
enough to decode audio to fill buffer then there's also something with 
usb-audio that jams it after a while? I don't think all of this is FPU 
related.

Thanks, I'll have a look and see if I can make sense of it but not sure 
when will I find time.

Have you tried if it works? I think MTTCG is enabled for PPC64 but not 
sure about 32 bit PPC. The mac99 machine seems to init multiple CPUs but 
not sure if they'll use MTTCG. But you could test it to see if it makes 
any difference.

The Amiga like OSes I'm interested in don't use multiple cores so I'm 
mainly interested in improving single core performance. Also I'm not sure 
if (part of) your problem is slow FPU preventing fast enough audio 
decoding then having multiple CPUs with slow FPU would help as this may 
use a single thread anyway.
