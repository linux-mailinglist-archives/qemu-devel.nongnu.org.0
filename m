For future versions please make sure the mails sent a fully
threaded, so that all the patches are in-reply-to the cover
letter mail, rather than each scattered as a standalone mail.

The best way todo this is to use the excellent "git-publish"
tool. The added benefit of git-publish is that it will CC
all the subsystem maintainers whose code is touched

  https://github.com/stefanha/git-publish

It is packaged in Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora & EPEL

Daniel
