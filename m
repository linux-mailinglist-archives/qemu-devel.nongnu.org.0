Ah, then probably it can never be the default.  But for sure it could be
nice that higher level can opt-in and make it a default at some point as
long as it knows the network topology is safe to do so.

Yes, I fully agree with it, and for huge vm migrations I think TLS is in
many cases mandatory.

I do plan to work on it right afterwards if this series land, but as the
series grows I just noticed maybe we should start landing some codes that's
already solid.  Landing the code as another benefit that I want to make
sure the code merged at least won't affect the existing features.

So what I'm curious is why TLS is getting quite some attentions in the past
few years but I didn't even see any selftests included in migration-test on
tls.  That's something I wanted to look into, maybe even before adding the
preempt+tls support. But maybe I just missed something, as I didn't use tls
a lot in the past.

Thanks,
