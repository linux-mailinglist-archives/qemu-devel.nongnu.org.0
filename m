Hi WeiWei,

Thanks for reviewing this PR.

Regarding to possible behaviors on agnostic elements to mask =
instructions, I
want to ask for you and other's opinion on this proposed PR before =
sending the
next version.

I understand that there are multiple possibility for agnostic elements
according to v-spec. The main intent of this patch-set tries to add =
option that
can distinguish between tail policies. Setting agnostic elements to all =
1s
makes things simple and allow qemu to express that the element is =
agnostic.
Therefore I want unify **all** agnostic elements to be set to 1s in this =
when
this option is enabled.

To avoid affecting the current behavior, the option is default to =
=E2=80=9Cdisabled".
This option is an extra feature to offer so users that care can enable =
it on
their will.

Here are some replies to your review comments.

This PR will add tail agnostic feature. I am planning on adding the mask
policy in another PR to keep the size of change more reasonable for =
review.

Under [01/13]

ESZ and DSZ are redundant code that aren't cleaned-up in the past =
developments.
I prefer to clean this up first and add it back incrementally in the =
following
commit to make the commits more readable. I do agree with you that =
`ETYPE` is
not a straight-forward naming and I will change them to `ESZ`.

Under [03/13]
> Maybe miss a space here.

Nice catch here, thank you.

Under [04/13]

original code.

Yes I agree with you. I will update it in the next version.

Under [05/13]
> Similar to last patch, can use ESZ directly here.

I will update it in the next version.

Under [06/13]

Nice catch for this. I will cover LMUL < 1 cases for all functions in =
the next
version.

I will wait for you and other's reply on my comment on this.
