That defines the instruction sequence used to make a semihosting
call, but not the specification of what the calls are:
 * what call numbers perform which functions
 * how arguments are passed to the call (registers? parameter
   blocks in memory? other?)
 * the semantics of each function supported (number of arguments,
   behaviour, error handling)

That's really what I had in mind by the overall semihosting spec.

PS: the parenthetical about ARM semihosting at the bottom  of
the text you quote is wrong, incidentally. The traditional insn
for semihosting on A-profile devices has always been SWI/SVC; it
is BKPT only on M-profile devices; and the latest revision of the
semihosting spec recommends the HLT instruction for both A- and M-.
