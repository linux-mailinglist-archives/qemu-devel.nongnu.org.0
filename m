By now I am pretty sure the code that gets triggered is

src/vendor/golang.org/x/crypto/poly1305/sum_s390x.s

in the go repository.

I started writing unit tests for all involved vector instructions, no=20
luck so far. Could also be some side-effect/BUG of another instruction.

Will let you know once I know more :)
