Remotely related, this thread suggest to rename the current Frankenstein=20
PIIX as 'virt_southbridge' /s
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg691232.html

Seriously, apparently thinking to modify PIIX scares various people.
Is there a virt equivalent that could work?
On one hand people want to use Windows guest unmodified (or with=20
digitally signed drivers, which seems impossible to do with virtio=20
package [*]). OTOH we are not sure how the PIIX model works because it=20
is not based on specs, and does not match its datasheet, and do not want=20
to modify it.

[*] If you click on 'How to Release-Sign File System Drivers' on
https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/WindowsGuestDrivers/Download_Drivers
it opens https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/tips/IFS_Signing.mspx
and displays "Your request has been blocked."...
