I finally found a real computer on which this bug is present.

The computer in question is a netbook manufactured by Positivo, the Mobo
5900, which is common on schools. It has a touchscreen with a pen which
is compatible with evdev but that doesn't work with libinput. Its
touchscreen is:

Bus 004 Device 006: ID 22b9:0005 eTurboTouch Technology, Inc.

The attached image not only shows the hint from the pulseaudio-plugin,
but another one caused by pavucontrol.

As a virtual keyboard is normally used because the netbook can be used
as a tablet, the hints can make some keys impossible to use.

Title:
  Hint showing volume never disappears, blocking buttons to minimize,
  maximize and close

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  When hovering the mouse over the volume indicator or changing its
  volume using the mouse wheel it shows the current volume set as a
  hint. For example:

  Volume 100%

  The problem is that the hint never disappears, not even clicking on
  it. On some occasions the hint can cover the minimize, maximize and
  close buttons, causing significant problems on using the desktop
  environment, as these three buttons won't be usable anymore with the
  hint over it.

  Where the hint appears it's no longer possible to interact with the
  screen.
