--verbose please.

As far I know seabios switches to LBA mode when the disk is simply too
big for LCHS addressing.  So I fail to see which problem is solved by
this.  If your guest needs LCHS, why do you assign a disk which can't
be fully accessed using LCHS addressing?

Well, not really.  Moving disks from one controller to another when the
OS depends on LHCS addressing never is a good idea.  That already caused
problems in the 90-ies, when moving scsi disks from one scsi host
adapter to another type, *way* before virtualization became a thing.

BTW:  One possible way to figure which LCHS layout a disk uses is to
check the MBR partition table.  With that we (a) don't need a new
interface between qemu and seabios and (b) it is not needed to manually
specify the geometry.

cheers,
