I think we fixed this bug in commit 013aabdc665e4256b38d which would
have been in the 3.1.0 release (this is why we closed #1774677, which as
you say is the same issue).

Title:
  -icount,sleep=3Doff mode is broken (target slows down or hangs)

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  QEMU running with options "-icount,sleep=3Doff -rtc clock=3Dvm" doesn't e=
xecute emulation at maximum possible speed.
  Target virtual clock may run faster or slower than realtime clock by N ti=
mes, where N value depends on various unrelated conditions (i.e. random fro=
m the user point of view). The worst case is when target hangs (hopefully, =
early in booting stage).
  Example scenarios I've described here: http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/ht=
ml/qemu-discuss/2018-08/msg00102.html

  QEMU process just sleeps most of the time (polling, waiting some
  condition, etc.). I've tried to debug issue and came to 99% conclusion
  that there are racing somewhere in qemu internals.

  The feature is broken since v2.6.0 release.

    icount: remove obsolete warp call
    =

    qemu_clock_warp call in qemu_tcg_wait_io_event function is not needed
    anymore, because it is called in every iteration of main_loop_wait.

  I've reverted commit to all major releases and latest git master
  branch. Issue was fixed for all of them. My adaptation is trivial:
  just restoring removed function call before "qemu_cond_wait(...)"
  line.

  I'm sure following bugs are just particular cases of the issue:
  #1774677, #1653063 .
