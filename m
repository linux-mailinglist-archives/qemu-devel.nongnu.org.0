After reading a bit about compiling to WebSockets it sounds like you
can cross-compile a C program, but there's no library support at all.
IOW to port an existing server you'd have to implement enough of POSIX
to make it work.  nbdkit has a liberal license deliberately to make it
possible to chop it up and incorporate it into completely forked
codebases (nbdkit is a plot to make NBD more popular).

But since NBD is pretty simple, a fresh Javascript server might be
easier, especially if you stick to only implementing reads.
