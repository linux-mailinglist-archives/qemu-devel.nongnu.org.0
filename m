Daniel asked similar question wrt hard error on start up,
when CLI is not sufficient to create EPYC cpu.

https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg728536.html

Migration might fall into the same category.
Also looking at the history, 5.0 commit 
  247b18c593ec29 target/i386: Enable new apic id encoding for EPYC based cpus models
silently broke APIC ID (without versioning), for all EPYC models (that's were 1 new and 1 old one).

(I'm not aware of somebody complaining about it)

Another commit ed78467a21459, changed CPUID_8000_001E without versioning as well.


With current EPYC apicid code, if all starts align (no numa or 1 numa node only on
CLI and no -smp dies=) it might produce a valid CPU (apicid+CPUID_8000_001E).
No numa is gray area, since EPYC spec implies that it has to be numa machine in case of real EPYC cpus.
Multi-node configs would be correct only if user assigns cpus to numa nodes
by duplicating internal node_id algorithm that this series removes.

There might be other broken cases that I don't recall anymore
(should be mentioned in previous versions of this series)


To summarize from migration pov (ignoring ed78467a21459 change):

 1) old qemu pre-5.0 ==>  qemu 5.0, 5.1 - broken migration
 2) with this series (lets call it qemu 5.2)
     pre-5.0 ==> qemu 5.2 - should work as series basically rollbacks current code to pre-5.0
     qemu 5.0, 5.1 ==> qemu 5.2 - broken

It's all about picking which poison to choose,
I'd preffer 2nd case as it lets drop a lot of complicated code that
doesn't work as expected.

PS:
 I didn't review it yet, but with this series we aren't
 making up internal node_ids that should match user provided numa node ids somehow.
 It seems series lost the patch that would enforce numa in case -smp dies>1,
 but otherwise it heads in the right direction.
