OK. We really never should see this error as we check for device
mappings right before calling this, but I guess it doesn't hurt.

OK, I see your point. I guess we rely on the implicit requirement that
all the available memory is MTE-capable, although I'm willing to bet
that someone will eventually break this requirement.

Nah, that'd be way too good. Let's not do that.

Yup. BTW, the return values have been fixed to proper boolean types in
the latest set of fixes.

What I was suggesting is to have something like this:

     pfr = read_sanitised_ftr_reg(SYS_ID_AA64PFR1_EL1);
     mte = cpuid_feature_extract_unsigned_field(pfr, ID_AA64PFR1_MTE_SHIFT);
     val |= FIELD_PREP(FEATURE(ID_AA64PFR1_MTE), mte);

which does the trick nicely, and doesn't expose more than the host
supports.

Thanks,

	M.
