The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  error while building from source on Ubuntu 16.04

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I'm trying to build Qemu from source (from git) as specified here:
  http://www.qemu-project.org/download/#source

  Here is the git commit hash for the source:
  7d2c6c95511e42dffe2b263275e09957723d0ff4

  During the 'make' step, I get the following error:

  make: *** [migration/rdma.o] Error 1

  I searched around a bit, my problem seems related to this:
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/992952/

  That issue makes me think my libibverbs may be out of date, but I
  checked and I have libibverbs-dev installed.  Is that the correct
  version?

  FYI, I installed libibverbs-dev as suggested here: http://wiki.qemu-
  project.org/index.php/Hosts/Linux#Recommended_additional_packages
