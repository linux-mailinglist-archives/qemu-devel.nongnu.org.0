I wouldn't force that on the user. The only reason why I'm not allowing
the non-sector-aligned case is because it's currently broken, but I
wouldn't have a problem with it if it was working fine.

Ok

Ok, I can also replace the "qemu-io write" with a "qemu-img info" or
something like that to make it a bit less confusing (i.e. the error
happens already when you open the image, not when you write to it).
