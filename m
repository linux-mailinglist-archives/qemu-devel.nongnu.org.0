I agree it would be nice.  We just need a method to tell guest
software that we are really making this additional guarantee.

Host-dependent defaults may be convenient for end users running
QEMU directly, but not a good idea if a stable guest ABI is
expected from your VM configuration (which is the case for
software using the libvirt API).
