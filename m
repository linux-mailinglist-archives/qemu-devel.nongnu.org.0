I disagree. If you are creating an overlay on top of an existing image
it's not safe to probe the format any more generally. (obviously you'd
have to trust the image and express the trust somehow)

The image may have been used in a VM as raw and that means that the VM
might have recorded a valid qcow2 header into it. Creating the overlay
with probing would legitimize this.

Let's assume we have a malicious image written by the guest but we
simulate it by:

$ qemu-img  create -f qcow2 -F raw -b /etc/passwd /tmp/malicious
Formatting '/tmp/malicious', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D2560 backing_file=3D/etc/pa=
sswd backing_fmt=3Draw cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcount_b=
its=3D16


Now we want to create an overlay.

a) without this patchset:

$ qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /tmp/malicious /tmp/pre-patch.qcow2
Formatting '/tmp/pre-patch.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D2560 backing_file=3D/=
tmp/malicious cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcount_bits=3D16
$ qemu-img info /tmp/pre-patch.qcow2
image: /tmp/pre-patch.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 2.5 KiB (2560 bytes)
disk size: 196 KiB
cluster_size: 65536
backing file: /tmp/malicious
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false

There's no 'backing file format'. When used by libvirt we'd not allow
the VM to touch the backing file of /tmp/malicious in pre-blockdev era
and in libvirt-6.0 we'd report an error right away.

b) Now with this patchset:

$ ./qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b /tmp/malicious /tmp/post-patch.qcow2
qemu-img: warning: Deprecated use of non-raw backing file without explicit =
backing format, using detected format of qcow2
Formatting '/tmp/post-patch.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D2560 backing_file=3D=
/tmp/malicious backing_fmt=3Dqcow2 cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Dof=
f refcount_bits=3D16
$ qemu-img info /tmp/post-patch.qcow2
image: /tmp/post-patch.qcow2
file format: qcow2
virtual size: 2.5 KiB (2560 bytes)
disk size: 196 KiB
cluster_size: 65536
backing file: /tmp/malicious
backing file format: qcow2
Format specific information:
    compat: 1.1
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 16
    corrupt: false

You now get a warning, but "backing file format" is now recorded in the
overlay. Now this is WAY worse than it was before. The overlay now
legitimizes the format recorded by the malicious guest which circumvents
libvirt's protections. The warning is very easy to miss, and if you run
it in scripts you might never get to see it. We can't allow that.

While it's safe I don't think it should be encouraged. IMO -F should be
made mandatory with -b.

Not necessarily. The backing store string can be e.g.:

$ ./qemu-img create -f qcow1 -b 'json:{"driver":"file","filename":"/tmp/mal=
icious"}' /tmp/json.qcow2
Formatting '/tmp/json.qcow1', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D197120 backing_file=3Djson=
:{"driver":"file",,"filename":"/tmp/malicious"} cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_r=
efcounts=3Doff refcount_bits=3D16
$ qemu-img info /tmp/json.qcow1
image: /tmp/json.qcow1
file format: qcow1
virtual size: 191 KiB (197120 bytes)
disk size: 195 KiB
cluster_size: 65535
backing file: json:{"driver":"file","filename":"/tmp/malicious"}
Format specific information:
    compat: 0.1
    lazy refcounts: false
    refcount bits: 15
    corrupt: false

Now this has the old semantics but we didn't even get the warning. But
at least the backing file format is not written into the overlay.

We must never write the detected format into the overlay. Not even when
we print a warning. This can legitimize a malicious file if the user
mises the warning.
