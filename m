Figuring out what can be used with KVM and what is only TCG is itself
not entirely easy.

One way to identify high priority devices would be to use 'virt-install'
to create some KVM guests and look at what devices it turns on for each
host architecture that is important. I'd probably prioritize x86_64
first, then any of ppc64/aarch64/s390x after, as that reflects where
much of the KVM userbase is likely spread.

Certainly anything virtio based is going to be top, but we do also use
some non-virtio stuff fairly often. eg various graphics cards in
particular, since virtio is quite new there &:

vfio PCI passthrough is another common non-virtio device.

Daniel
