Aha, I see what you were looking at: within the script itself, it was 10 
'] ;' vs. 2 '];'.  In which case, I'd recommend swapping the 10 
instances over to be common with the rest of the code base, rather than 
the 2 away from the rest of the code base but towards the rest of the 
script.

Good to hear.

Splitting into two patches (one to fix '] ;' spacing, the other to add 
'[ "x$..."' protection) is then the best course of action.
