Having an emulated device that supports namespace management would be
very useful for testing software, but yeah, I have a hard time seeing
how we can make that fit with the current "QEMU model".

Thanks for looking at it, I know it's a lot to go through ;)

Hi Kevin,

This highlights another situation where the "1 image to 1 block device"
model doesn't fit that well with NVMe. Especially with the introduction
of "NVM Sets" in NVMe 1.4. It would be very nice to introduce a
'nvme-nvmset' device model that adds an NVM Set which the controller can
then create namespaces in.

Is it completely unacceptable for a device to use the image in such a
way that it would not make sense (aka present the same block device)
when attached to another device (ide, ...)?

I really have a hard time seeing how we could support these features
without violating the '1 image to 1 block device" model.


Cheers,
Klaus
