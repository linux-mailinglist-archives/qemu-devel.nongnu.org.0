hi Alex
maybe the problem can be divided into two pieces:
(1) how to create/locate two migration compatible devices. For normal
users, the most common and safest way to do it is to find a exact duplication
of the source device. so for mdev, it's probably to create a target mdev
of the same parent pci id, mdev type and creation parameters as the
source mdev; and for physical devices, it's to locate a target device of the
same pci id as the source device, plus some extra constraints (e.g. the
target NVMe device is configured to the same remote device as the source
NVMe device; or the target QAT device is supporting equal encryption
algorithm set as the source QAT device...).
I think a possible solution for this piece is to let vendor drivers provide a
creating/locating script to find such exact duplication of source device.
Then before libvirt is about to do live migration, it can use this script to
create a target vm of exactly duplicated configuration of the source vm.

(2) how to identify two devices are migration compatible after they are
created and even they are not exactly identical (e.g. their parent
devices are of minor difference in hardware SKUs). This identification is
necessary even after in step (1) when libvirt has created/located two
identical devices and are about to start live migration.
Also, users are free to create/configure target devices and use the
read-and-test interfaces defined in this series to check if they are
live migration compatible.
The read and test behavior in this patch set can grant vendor drivers the
freedom to decide whether to support migration between only exact identical
devices or able to support migration between devices of minor
difference. 

So, do you think we can let this series focus on the second piece of
problem and leave the first piece to other future series.

Thanks
Yan
