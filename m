Right now, that document lives in error.h.  Has it outgrown that home?

I prefer to at least understand how errors can happen.  The
understanding often leads to a way to test, or to the realization that
it's actually a programming error.

When the way to test requires some "unobtanium", i.e. hardware or
software I can't access or set up with reasonable effort, I feel okay
adding mockup code for testing, as a best effort.  Proper test coverage
is then up to the people with the necessary access and knowledge.

There will always be the occasional edge case where you have to settle
for less than proper testing.  That's okay, life is short.  All I really
ask for is to at least *think* about the error paths and their testing.
