I think your instincts are right that there are deeper issues.  The
first step would be test cases, then you can be sure various scenarios
have been handled correctly.

I noticed that ide_sector_read_cb(), ide_sector_write_cb(), and
ide_flush_cb() all differ in whether they reset s->pio_aiocb and
s->status before returning early due to -ECANCELED.  That must be a bug.

I didn't look at the ide_dma_cb() code path.
