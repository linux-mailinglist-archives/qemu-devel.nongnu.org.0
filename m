Nope.

Stupid test script:

    $ cat test-yaml.py
    #!/usr/bin/python3

    import sys, yaml

    data =3D yaml.load(sys.stdin, Loader=3Dyaml.CLoader)
    print(data)

Example taken from block.json:

    $ ./test-yaml.py <<EOF
    enum: FloppyDriveType
    data:
    - 144
    - 288
    - 120
    - none
    - auto
    EOF
    {'enum': 'FloppyDriveType', 'data': [144, 288, 120, 'none', 'auto']}

The upper layer will choke on this:

    qapi/block.yaml: In enum 'FloppyDriveType':
    qapi/block.yaml:61: 'data' member requires a string name

You could propose to provide "wouldn't need to quote anything" by
silently converting numbers back to strings.  I got two issues with
that.

1. What's the point in switching to an off-the-shelf parser to replace
less than 400 SLOC if I then have to write non-trivial glue code to make
the syntax less surprising?

2. Let me trot out the tired Norway problem again.  Say we QAPIfy -k so
that its argument is an enum, for nice introspection.  Something like

    $ ./test-yaml.py <<EOF
    enum: Keymap
    data:
    - ar
    - cz
    - de
    - de-ch
    - en-gb
    - en-us
    - no
    - pt
    - pt-br
    EOF
    {'enum': 'Keymap', 'data': ['ar', 'cz', 'de', 'de-ch', 'en-gb', 'en-us'=
, False, 'pt', 'pt-br']}

To which of the eleven ways to say False in YAML should we convert?

YAML and the schema language are fundamentally at odds here: they fight
over types.  YAML lets the value determine the type regardless of
context.  But in the schema, the context determines the type.

Picking holes in a proposal is precisely what we need to do before we
act on it and rebase our QAPI schema DSL.  That's expensive and painful,
so we better don't screw it up *again*.

Here's my superficial five minute assessment of the essay's main points
for our use case:

* Insecure by default

  Valid criticism of existing YAML tools, but hardly relevant for us,
  because 1. "don't do that then", and 2. the QAPI schema is trusted
  input.

* Can be hard to edit, especially for large files

  Valid when you use YAML to describe data.  We would use it as an IDL,
  though.  If parts of the interface description get too deeply nested
  or too long for comfort, we better provide means to rearrange it in
  more pleasant ways.  However, if our new base language got
  uncomfortable earlier than the old one, and the existing means to
  rearrange prove to weak (they are pretty weak), then we'd create
  additional work.

  I'm cautiously optimistic that YAML would do okay here.

* It=E2=80=99s pretty complex

  If you go "we'll use only a simple subset", then I go "define the
  subset, and tell me how to enforce the subset.  I have no interest in
  teaching contributors one by one which of the nine ways to write a
  multiline string to avoid, or which of the eleven ways to say False to
  use.

* Surprising behavior

  See "fight over types" above.

* It=E2=80=99s not portable

  Probably irrelevant, because feeding the schema to another YAML parser
  is so unlikely to be useful.

Would it improve things enough to be worth the switching pain?
