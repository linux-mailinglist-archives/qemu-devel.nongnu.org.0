I found the thread which discussed the bug which originally
caused us to add commit 4b7a6bf402bd064:
https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/kvmarm/2015-July/015665.html
 -- there are some codepaths which cause us to do a sync from/to
KVM for one VCPU while others are still running. If we do a
read-CNT-and-write-back then we effectively cause time to jump
backwards for the other still-running CPUs.

So we do still want to have TIMER_CNT listed as being KVM_PUT_FULL_STATE
regardless, or we re-introduce that bug.

Your approach in this patchset reads and writes on vm-paused,
so it won't have the pre-2015 problems.

It still feels odd that we're storing this bit of guest state
in two places now though -- in kvm_vtime, and also in its usual
place in the cpreg_array data structures (we write back the
value from kvm_vtime when the VM starts running, and we write
back the value from the cpreg_array for a PUT_FULL_STATE, which
the comments claim is only on startup or when we just loaded
migration state (and also undocumentedly but reasonably on
cpu-hotplug, which arm doesn't have yet).

I've just spent a little while digging through code, and
haven't been able to satisfy myself on the ordering of which
writeback wins: for a loadvm I think we first do a
cpu_synchronize_all_post_init() (writing back the counter
value from the migration data) and then after than we will
unpause the VM -- why doesn't this overwrite the correct
value with the wrong value from kvm_vtime ?

I just noticed also that the logic used in this patch
doesn't match what other architectures do in their vm_state_change
function -- eg cpu_ppc_clock_vm_state_change() has an
"if (running) { load } else { save }", and kvmclock_vm_state_change()
for i386 also has "if (running) { ... } else { ... }", though
it has an extra wrinkle where it captures "are we PAUSED?"
to use in the pre_save function; the comment above
kvmclock_pre_save() suggests maybe that would be useful for other
than x86, too. kvm_s390_tod_vm_state_change() has
logic that's a slightly more complicated variation on just
testing the 'running' flag, but it doesn't look at the
specific new state.

I meant more "only do the save/load once per VM in QEMU but
do it by working with just one VCPU". But I guess since migration
works on all the VCPUs we're ok to do pause-resume the same way
(and I've now tracked down what the 'inconsistentencies between VCPUs'
were: they're when we were syncing the CNT value for one vCPU when
others were still running.)
