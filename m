I thought of that, too, but then decided not to mention it because I
feel it might be hard to decide where a test belongs. Many tests are
qcow2 and mirror tests at the same time, every commit test is also a
backing file test etc.

This is essentially why we have groups and each test can be in more
than one group.

On the other hand, I assume that for some tests it would be quite clear
where they belong. So if we're prepared to have some tests directly in
tests/ and only some others in subdirectories, we can still do that.

True, this would be a good replacement. I don't think it's a requirement
to have it in this series, but I won't complain if you implement it. :-)

It was just a thought. If you prefer testfinder.py, I'm fine with it.

Type checkers only work if things are consistently annotated. For
example, if a function definition doesn't have type hints, the whole
code in this function stays completely unchecked even if it contains an
obvious error like passing a string literal to another function that is
annotated to take an int.

So I think we should add type hints everywhere.
