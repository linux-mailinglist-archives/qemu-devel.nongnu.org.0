Thanks for the testing. I'm not sure why a single-cpu setup
would have problems but I guess some device has a bottom-half or
timer callback that will run in the iothread context, in which
case it could race with the vcpu thread doing a dcr access. As
you say, probably 235352ee6e rather than this change that's fixed it,
assuming we really have fixed it.

Yeah, the memory-region adjustment done under the pcie_host_mmcfg_update()
function will assert that the iothread lock is held. The locking just
needs to be one level further up in the callstack.
