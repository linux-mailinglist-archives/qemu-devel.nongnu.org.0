We raise this qeustion here because we find out that if the pcie ext=20
capability PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA is set by default, linux kernel may try=20
to send PCI_EXP_HP_EV_PDC event after boot-up. When we do virtio device=20
hotplug during the processing of PCI_EXP_HP_EV_PDC event (pciehp_ist=20
=3D>pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change =3D> pciehp_enable_slot)
the device may be accidently powered down because the power state=20
detected is ON_STATE.

Kernel sends PCI_EXP_HP_EV_PDC event when it tries to probe the
pcie-root-probe, i.e:
pciehp_probe =3D> pciehp_check_presence =3D>=20
pciehp_card_present_or_link_active  =3D> pciehp_check_link_active
pciehp_check_link_active returns true if PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA Cap is=20
presented.

We are going send a patch to have PCI_EXP_LNKSTA_DLLLA Cap removed to=20
fix the problem here.

Thanks to your opinion, we will try to send PCI_EXP_HP_EV_PDC event=20
instead of the PCI_EXP_HP_EV_PDC event at device unplug and do some=20
Windows guest compatibility test.
We will reply later.
