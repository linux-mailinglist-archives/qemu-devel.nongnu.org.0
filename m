I can't claim to have knowledge of whether the above text is accurate
or not, instead I just defer to the Linux maintainers recommendatiohns.
They've considered it acceptable to merge it into Linux, and to me that
says it should be acceptable to have in EDK2 too.

As a second data point, jitter entropy has been the recommended solution
in RHEL for VMs where there's no RDRAND or virtio-rng available. In RHEL-7
this was implemented in userspace in rng-tools rather than with the kernel
module I link above, but the approach is the same in both cases IIUC.
