Public bug reported:


I'm running MS-DOS 7.10 in a QEMU virtual machine, and there is a problem w=
ith the keyboard in the Vim editor.  The arrow keys jump over a line, as if=
 you had typed the key twice.  PgUp and PgDn are likewise affected.  Other =
applications are not affected, unless you shell out from Vim.

The QEMU version is 5.0.0, and I'm using the "-k sv" option, but I've
tried without it and it doesn't make a difference.

I don't get this keyboard behaviour in the exact same VM under VMware
Player or Bochs.

-Albert.
