Yeah sorry about the double patches. That was because of a botched rebase.
It applied my commits twice.
I am working on cleaning up the header files and other fixes.

 > Are you aware of my project page for ATI VGA emulation here:
Yes I am. Your code got me through the initial setup.

&gt; Hello,<br>

<br>
Good idea, :-) I very welcome any contribution to this.<br>

&gt; The following patch series contains the initial QEMU device and some r=

<br>
Also is it possible to keep everything in ati-vga only adding another <br>
device model there rather than fully duplicating it as r300* ? Although <br=

<br>
In short I think this series needs some cleanup first for us to be able to =
<br>

<br>
&gt; Testing it on an OpenSUSE Linux guest and the kernel correctly detects=
 the card and loads the radeon DRM driver.<br>

<br>
reason specifically targeting that is OK too.<br>
<br>
&gt; It gets as far as the CRTC probing before crashing with an error that =
there is not enough bandwidth.<br>
<br>
Getting DRM to load is one thing but likely you&#39;ll need to implement <b=

microengine/command processor (also referred to as PM4 or programming mode =
<br>
4 sometimes) to get it fully working as that&#39;s how DRM and Windows ATI =

The difficult part is probably figuring out how to run it in a different <b=
