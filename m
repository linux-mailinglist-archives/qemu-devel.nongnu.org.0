Why is the Makefile.target change not in this patch?

Please structure patch series as logical changes that can be reviewed
sequentially.  Not only is it hard for reviewers to understand what is
going on but it probably also breaks bisectability if patches contain
incomplete changes.

It's too bad that none of these judgements were documented.  As a
reviewer I have no idea what the justification for each individual stub
was.

Some stubs are unavoidable but they also indicate that the code is
tightly coupled where maybe it can be split up.  The
qdev-properties-system.c example you mentioned sounds like something
that should be broken up into multiple files.  Then stubs wouldn't be
necessary.

That said, adding stubs doesn't place a great burden on anyone and I
think they can be merged.
