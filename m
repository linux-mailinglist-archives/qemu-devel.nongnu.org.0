Ok, thanks, I've added your suggestions and pushed the changes now to
the website.

To the people on CC: ... could someone please update the wiki page
(https://wiki.qemu.org/SecurityProcess) to point to
https://www.qemu.org/contribute/security-process/ instead? ... I don't
have write access to that page, so I can not do that on my own.

 Thomas
