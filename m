For QEMU this would mean re-writing the code to use qcrypto_random_bytes
instead. This internal API is backed by a crypto lib if available,
falling back to /dev/urandom or /dev/random on UNIX, or CryptGenRandom
on Windows. We could add getrandom() support there too.

The main question is whether to implement a new backends/rng-builtin.c
or modify backends/rng-random.c so that it has a NULL filename by
default, which would be taken as meaning use the qcrypto_random_bytes
API.  The latter benefits that all existing VMs which don't have a
filename set would get the new behaviour. The latter has downside
that it is not discoverable from mgmt apps, so they won't know if
they can rely on it or not.

Thus I'd probably tend towards a new backend for discoverability.
