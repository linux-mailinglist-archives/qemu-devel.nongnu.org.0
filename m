The private dbus damon for QEMU is expected to exist for the lifetime of
that QEMU process.

The memory usage of a dbus daemon shouldn't be that high. A large portion
of the memory footprint should be readony pages shared between all dbus
procsses. The private usage should be a functional of number of clients
and the message traffic. Do you have any measured figures you're concerned
with ?
