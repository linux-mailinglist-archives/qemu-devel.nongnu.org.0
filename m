Correct.

docs/system/build-platforms.rst:

    For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim
    to support the most recent major version at all times.  Support for
    the previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new
    major version is released, or when it reaches "end of life".

Debian 8 reached end of life in 2018, one year after 9's release.

>     9/Stretch: 1.4.8 -- Broken at present!

Will reach end of life this summer, one year after 10's release.
