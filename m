Now it's clear that a dict would've been the best option from the
beginning, but I was wrongly optimistic, and biased by the
"avocado.utils.vmimage" + "avocado.utils.cloudinit" combination, that
we'd only have to deal with key based auth.

So the question now is really how to evolve the API, either breaking
the current version or not.  At this time, I'd try to keep the API
unchanged, given that it still feels logical that the tuple is about
credentials, just that the second item can be either a path to a key
or password.

Thoughts?
