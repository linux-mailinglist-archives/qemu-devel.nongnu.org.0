The rationale is in the commit message -- QEMU *already* does not
build on 10.11, and it has not done so for more than six months, and
none of these Mac users has submitted a patch to try to fix it.
"Last two versions only" is our support policy for OSX for a reason,
and the reason is that there just aren't very many people running
OSX and actively working on QEMU. Of those, even fewer will
be still running OSX versions that are no longer being supported
for security fixes by Apple.
