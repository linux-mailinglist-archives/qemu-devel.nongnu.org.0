I'm missing what this constant exists for - why is the
check there at all  Is there something else that lives below this
address that we have to protect?
My reading of the code is that increasing that constant doesn't change
the guests view at all, as long as the guest was given the same flash
files - so if the guests view doesn't change, then why would we tie
it to the machine type?

Our UEFI firmware is pretty sparse; it doesn't have any pretty graphics
or snazzy stuff, or have to survive configuring lots of hardware; also
I'm aware of other companies who are looking at putting big blobs
of stuff in firmware for open uses;  so I don't see a problem with
changing this limit from the QEMU side of things.
