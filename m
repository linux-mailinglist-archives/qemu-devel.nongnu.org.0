As I stated further up the thread I'd be happy to take a patch that
turns this on without the messing about with the FPU flags which AFAICT
breaks the architectural compliance of those instructions. The ability
to detect inexact results is part of the IEEE spec even if it is
considerably looser about when the flag should be reset.

Those are bugs that should be fixed. The state of the flags after a
calculation should be considered part of the "values" generated by the
FPU.

Giving the user the option to break things is a poor flag, most of QEMUs
configurable knobs are about trading of size/speed without affecting
correctness.

If the PPC maintainers are happy that hardfloat's speed trade-offs are
worth it for usual workloads (whatever they may be) then I have no
objection to making defaulting hardfloat to on - perhaps* even with an
option to force softfloat if it faster for some workloads.
