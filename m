There are problems reliable booting the VM using TCG, HAXM, and Hyper-V.
TCG fails the least often. Attached is a pic of the error using HAXM, a
lot of "BUG: soft lockup detect on CPU#x!".

I tried to add logging but nothing ever shows up in the log file. I
tried adding "-d cpu,guest_errors -D E:\log.txt" to the command but the
log file is always empty.

Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64 kernel panic 30% of the time starting up VM

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I have created a Fedora Core 5 x86_64 VM image. When I run the image
  using QEMU on Windows the VM hangs while loading the kernel about 30%
  of the time. I am trying to use this VM with a CI software, looking at
  the history the build failed 27 out of 79 attempts. QEMU 3.0.0 is
  installed on the CI machine. I have tried using the exact same image
  using QEMU on Linux (Ubuntu) and found the image boot successful every
  time (40+ attempts). The VM image is fairly old it was created using
  QEMU 0.11.1.

  I have tried multiple versions on QEMU on windows; 0.11.1, 2.12.1, and
  3.0.0 all of them fail randomly. I can reproduce the issue on several
  different Windows 10 computers.

  The command I am using to start the VM is =E2=80=9Cqemu-system-x86_64.exe=
 -cpu
  qemu64 -smp cores=3D2 -device e1000,netdev=3Dnet0 -boot menu=3Doff -m 1G
  -drive `"file=3DC:\qimages\Fedora-Core-5-x64.qcow2,index=3D0,media=3Ddisk=
`"
  -snapshot -netdev user,id=3Dnet0,hostfwd=3Dtcp::10022-:22=E2=80=9D

  I can provide the qcow image but it is somewhat large coming it at
  4.15GB so I=E2=80=99m not sure what would be the best way to transfer it.
