It does.

I'm fine with state-specific extra adressing modes (I better be, I
proposed them).

I'd also be fine with a single state-independent addressing mode, as
long as we can come up with sane semantics.  Less flexible when adding
states, but we almost certainly won't.

Let's see how we could merge my two addressing modes into one.

The two are

* active

  keyslot     old-secret      slot(s) selected
  absent      N/A             one inactive slot if exist, else error
  present     N/A             the slot given by @keyslot

* inactive

  keyslot     old-secret      slot(s) selected
  absent      absent          all keyslots
  present     absent          the slot given by @keyslot
  absent      present         all active slots holding @old-secret
  present     present         the slot given by @keyslot, error unless
                              it's active holding @old-secret

They conflict:

Note we we don't really care what "inactive, both absent" does.  My
proposed semantics are just the most regular I could find.  We can
therefore resolve the conflict by picking "active, both absent":

  keyslot     old-secret      slot(s) selected
  absent      absent          one inactive slot if exist, else error
  present     absent          the slot given by @keyslot
  absent      present         all active slots holding @old-secret
  present     present         the slot given by @keyslot, error unless
                              it's active holding @old-secret

Changes:

* inactive, both absent: changed; we select "one inactive slot" instead of
  "all slots".

  "All slots" is a no-op when the current state has no active keyslots,
  else error.

  "One inactive slot" is a no-op when the current state has one, else
  error.  Thus, we no-op rather than error in some states.

* active, keyslot absent or present, old-secret present: new; selects
  active slot(s) holding @old-secret, no-op when old-secret =3D=3D secret,
  else error (no in place update)

Can do.  It's differently irregular, and has a few more combinations
that are basically useless, which I find unappealing.  Matter of taste,
I guess.

Anyone got strong feelings here?
