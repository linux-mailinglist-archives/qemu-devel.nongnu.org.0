If we're using 1-round precopy + postcopy approach, the amount of memory
will be the same which is the guest mem size.

Multifd will make the round shorter so more chance of getting less
re-dirtied pages during the iteration, but that effect is limited.  E.g.:

  - For a very idle guest, finishing 1st round in 1min or 3min may not
    bring a large difference because most of the pages will be constant
    anyway, or

  - For a very busy guest, probably similar amount of pages will be dirtied
    no matter in 1min / 3min.  Multifd will bring a benefit here, but
    busier the guest smaller the effect.

I fully agree.

It should not need to be enabled only if not capable, e.g., the dest host
may not have privilege to initiate the userfaultfd (since QEMU postcopy
requires kernel fault traps, so it's very likely).

The recent introduction of /dev/userfaultfd should make it even less likely
to happen, it'll still require (1) admin adjusted permissions of the
devnode and qemu ownership so qemu is in the white list, and (2) kernel
needs to be new enough to have /dev/userfaultfd.

That's doable.  But then we'd better also figure out how to identify the
below two use cases of both features enabled:

  a. Enable multifd in precopy only, then switch to postcopy (currently
  mostly working but buggy; I think Juan can provide more information here,
  at least we need to rework multifd flush when switching, and test and
  test over to make sure there's nothing else missing).

  b. Enable multifd in both precopy and postcopy phase (currently
  definitely not supported)

So that mgmt app will be aware whether multifd will be enabled in postcopy
or not.  Currently we can't identify it.

I assume we can say by default "mutlifd+postcopy" means a) above, but we
need to document it, and when b) is wanted and implemented someday, we'll
need some other flag/cap for it.
