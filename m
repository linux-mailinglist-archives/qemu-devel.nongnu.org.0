The vfio_{pin,unpin}_pages() interface only comes into play for mdev
devices and even then it's an announcement that a given mapping is
going away and the vendor driver is required to release references.
For normal PCI device assignment, vfio-pci is (aside from a few quirks)
device agnostic and the IOMMU container mappings are independent of the
device.  We do not have any device specific knowledge to know if DMA
pages still have device references.  The user's unmap request is
absolute, it cannot fail (aside from invalid usage) and upon return
there must be no residual mappings or references of the pages.

If you say there's no config space write, ex. clearing bus master from
the command register, then something like turning on a vIOMMU might
cause a change in the entire address space accessible by the device.
This would cause the identity map of IOVA to GPA to be replaced by a
new one, perhaps another identity map if iommu=pt or a more restricted
mapping if the vIOMMU is used for isolation.

It sounds like you have an incomplete device model, physical devices
have their address space adjusted by an IOMMU independent of, but
hopefully in collaboration with a device driver.  If a physical device
manages to bridge this transition, do what it does.  Thanks,

Alex
