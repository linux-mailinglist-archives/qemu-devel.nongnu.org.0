Besides the above here's another use case of the fix ups that I wanted to 
keep:

https://patchew.org/QEMU/cover.1592315226.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/b5f4598529a77f15f554c593e9be2d0ff9e5fab3.1592315226.git.balaton@eik.bme.hu/

This board normally uses OpenBIOS which gets RAM size from fw_cfg and so 
works with whatever amount of RAM (also Linux booted with -kernel probably 
does not care) so any -memory value is valid. However some may want to 
also use original firmware ROM for compatibility which detects RAM reading 
SPD eeproms (the i2c emulation needed for that is not working yet but once 
that's fixed this will be the case). I want to add smbus_eeproms for this 
but do not want to just abort for cases where -memory given by user cannot 
be covered with SPD data. Instead a warning and covering as much RAM as 
possible should be enough (the ROM will detect less RAM than given with -m 
but that's OK and better than just bailing out without a message tripping 
an assert). But I don't want to replicate in board code the calculation 
and checks the spd_data_generate() function does anyway (that would just 
puzzle reviewers for every use of this functions).

Previously this was possible with my original spd_data_generate() 
implementation. What's your suggestion to bring that functionality back 
without breaking Error API? Maybe adding new parameters to tell the 
spd_data_generate() which fixups are allowed?

BALATON Zoltan
