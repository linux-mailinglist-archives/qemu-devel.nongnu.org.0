Actually not, because the feature isn't in check_consistency()'s dep[].

Okay, let's play.

Here's query-cpu-definitions:

    $ echo -e '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}\n{"execute": "query-cpu-defi=
nitions"}\n{"execute": "quit"}' | ../qemu/bld/s390x-softmmu/qemu-system-s39=
0x -qmp-pretty stdio -S -display none | egrep 'msa4|pcc-cmac-e?aes-256'

Before this patch:

         28                 "pcc-cmac-eaes-256",

After:

         14                 "pcc-cmac-aes-256",
         14                 "pcc-cmac-eaes-256",

No msa4.

Here's query-cpu-model-expansion for model "qemu" (arbitrarily chosen),
type "static":

    $ echo -e '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}\n{"execute": "query-cpu-mode=
l-expansion", "arguments": {"type": "full", "model": {"name": "qemu"}}}\n{"=
execute": "quit"}' | $i -qmp-pretty stdio -S -display none | egrep 'msa4|pc=
c-cmac-e?aes-256' | sort | uniq -c

Before and after:

          1                 "msa4-base": true,

Same with type "full":

    $ echo -e '{"execute": "qmp_capabilities"}\n{"execute": "query-cpu-mode=
l-expansion", "arguments": {"type": "full", "model": {"name": "qemu"}}}\n{"=
execute": "quit"}' | $i -qmp-pretty stdio -S -display none | egrep 'msa4|pc=
c-cmac-e?aes-256' | sort | uniq -c

Before:

          1                 "msa4-base": true,
          1                 "pcc-cmac-eaes-256": false,

After

          1                 "msa4-base": true,
          1                 "pcc-cmac-aes-256": false,
          1                 "pcc-cmac-eaes-256": false,

The grouping and masking you described appears to apply to
query-cpu-model-expansion with type "static".  With type "full", I can
see the grouping, but not the masking.  With query-cpu-definitions, I
can't see either.

I haven't played with query-cpu-model-comparison and
query-cpu-model-baseline.

The commit message should be accurate and sufficiently precise.  The
"sufficiently" gives me some wiggle room to avoid inaccuracy due to my
ignorance.  Would the following be good enough?

    Impact:
   =20
    * s390_feat_bitmap_to_ascii() misidentifies S390_FEAT_PCC_CMAC_AES_256
      as "pcc-cmac-eaes-256".  Affects QMP commands query-cpu-definitions,
      query-cpu-model-expansion, query-cpu-model-baseline,
      query-cpu-model-comparison, and the error message when
      s390_realize_cpu_model() fails in check_compatibility().
   =20
    * s390_cpu_list() also misidentifies it.  Affects -cpu help.
   =20
    * s390_cpu_model_register_props() creates CPU property
      "pcc-cmac-eaes-256" twice.  The second one fails, but the error is
      ignored (a later commit will change that).  Results in a single
      property "pcc-cmac-eaes-256" with the description for
      S390_FEAT_PCC_CMAC_AES_256, and no property for
      S390_FEAT_PCC_CMAC_EAES_256.  CPU properties are visible in CLI -cpu
      and -device, QMP & HMP device_add, QMP device-list-properties, and
      QOM introspection.

    The two features are almost always used via their group msa4.  Such
    use is not affected by this bug.
