Thank you very much. I added these and bunch more to my patchset.

hmp_drive_add_node is there and I moved it too.

Nothing suspicious

qmp_dump_guest_memory is only monitor reference there I think

> hw/display/qxl.c
No way that is related to the block layer

> hw/scsi/vhost-scsi.c
All right, the monitor_fd_param is an interesting thing.
Not related to block though.

> hw/usb/dev-storage.c
All right, this for no reason includes monitor/monitor.h,
added patch to remove this because why not.

> monitor/hmp-cmds.c
Added hmp_qemu_io

Maybe I need to add hmp_delvm too?
savevm/delvm do old style snapshots
which are stored to the first block device


> monitor/hmp.c
There are some block references in monitor_find_completion,
but I guess it is not worth it to move that

> monitor/misc.c
vm_completion for delvm/loadvm.

> monitor/qmp-cmds.c
Nothing hmp related at first glance.

> qdev-monitor.c
blk_by_qdev_id - used by both hmp and qmp code

> vl.c
Hopefully nothing hmp+block related, I searched the file for
few things but I can't be fully sure.
Out of the curiosity do you know why this file is called like that,
since it hosts qemu main(), shouldn't it be called main.c ?


Best regards and thanks for the detailed review!
