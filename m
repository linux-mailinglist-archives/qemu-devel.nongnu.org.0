v10's PATCH 1+2 look ready.  The error.h comment update could perhaps
use some polish; I've focused my attention elsewhere.

PATCH 8-9 are generated.  They should never be rebased, always be
regenerated.  We compare regenerated patches to posted ones to make sure
they are still sane, and the R-bys are still valid.  I can take care of
the comparing.

I'd like to have a pull request ready when the tree reopens for general
development.  Let's use the time until then to get more generated
patches out for review.

If I queue up patches in my tree, we shift the responsibility for
regenerating patches from you to me, and create a coordination issue:
you'll want to base patch submissions on the branch I use to queue this
work, and that's going to be awkward when I rebase / regenerate that
branch.  I think it's simpler to queue up in your tree until we're ready
for a pull request.

When you post more patches, use

    Based-on: <20200317151625.20797-1-vsementsov@virtuozzo.com>

so that Patchew applies them on top of this series.  Hmm, probably won't
do, as PATCH 9 already conflicts.

You could instead repost PATCH 1+2 with each batch.  I hope that's not
too confusing.

I trust you'll keep providing a tag reviewers can pull.

I suggest to ask maintainers to leave merging these patches to me, in
cover letters.

Makes sense?
