Read the thread. Actually, I wrote some EDID parsing code a while ago, but
that's before QEMU supporting EDID so I had to do it outside QEMU and pass
my parsing result to ramfb as the now-removed starting_width /
starting_height. In the context QEMU, the EDID actually reflects the user
preference since the whole structure is usually made up from the
user-specified resolution. And I think most guest OSes initialize
first-time-seen monitors to their EDID resolution, which should have
motivated QEMU to provide an EDID for a virtual monitor.

But at this point it's kind of awkward to do the EDID / resolution handling
(that I need) in the ramfb driver as the kvmgt EDID has to be read out from
the i915 MMIO just like a physical GPU. Guess now my use case is better
covered with a fully functional i915 framebuffer driver for OVMF. If I had
the time...
