Some very high level questions:
  a) If I've got two QEMU's running, how do the right devices
   end up migrating to the right qemu?
  b) Why use dbus for the comms? Don't all of the daemons have some
   protocol'd socket between QEMU and the daemon? If so they could
   send up a separate FD for migration data
  c) Your 1MB limit is pretty aribtary - it's nice to have a limit
    but it's hard to justify why it's that one.
