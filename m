I missed this part.  Not your fault.

I see.

With plain text gone, I'll certainly look at any of the rendered stuff
even less than before.

Would it be possible to additionally render a complete manual as one
humongous .html?  Without an index, there's only search, and the
ergonomics of searching within a single page are so much better.

I'm tempted to write a trivial QAPI doc comment backend to spit out
minimally processed doc comments as one plain text file just for that.
