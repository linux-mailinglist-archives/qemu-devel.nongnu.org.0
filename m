Hm, yes.  In that case, there=E2=80=99s of course no point in moving it.

I meant moving the tests to somewhere where they run asynchronously.

Yes, it has its use, but at the same time it means that intermittent
failure can appear in make check because some iotest is broken.  (The
past has shown that it=E2=80=99s hard to predict which tests will at some=
 point
start to exhibit such behavior.)

This then requires immediate attention, and I simply want help with that
from someone who really cares about having the test be part of make
check, as I wrote in my reply to Thomas=E2=80=99s patch =E2=80=9Ciotests:=
 Do not run the
iotests during "make check" anymore=E2=80=9D.

The issues are just half as pressing when it isn=E2=80=99t make check tha=
t=E2=80=99s
intermittently failing.  (I hope nobody takes this as =E2=80=9CHe doesn=E2=
=80=99t want
to fix intermittent failures=E2=80=9D, because I do really try to do that=
=2E  So I
don=E2=80=99t consider this a good kind of pressure.)


I suppose my main problem is that I=E2=80=99m just lucky that I can=E2=80=
=99t remember a
case where the block subsystem was really broken and iotests in make
check would have caught it; and that I=E2=80=99m na=C3=AFve enough to exp=
ect this to
continue into the future.
