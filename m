The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting all older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  early virtio console output is lost

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  This is broken in git and reportedly in 2.5 through 2.7.

  Running a Linux kernel which includes a testsuite in initrd sometimes
  produces no output.

  Reportedly the console is sometimes not open when the early userspace
  tries to log output resulting in either the testsuite terminating
  early or not writing the output.

  Workaround patch is here:

  https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/commit/?id=3Dd2de8b0862a7fbb51a7f2f958d58=
f0efe4648259

  reportedly you would get -EBADF there when no output is generated.

  Also this reportedly happens with virtio console only, not virtio
  serial port.

  It seems that the author of said testsuite did not report the problem
  so I write it down so it does not get lost.

  test (in bash):

  n=3D0 ; while [ $n -lt 100 ] && grep -m 1 -F "WireGuard Test Suite on
  Linux 4.8.6" <( /opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-x86_64         -nodefaults
  -nographic         -machine q35,accel=3Dkvm         -cpu host
  -smp 2         -m 64M         -object rng-
  random,id=3Drng0,filename=3D/dev/urandom         -device virtio-rng-
  pci,rng=3Drng0         -device virtio-serial,max_ports=3D2
  -chardev stdio,id=3Dstdio         -device virtconsole,chardev=3Dstdio
  -chardev file,id=3Dstatus,path=3Dresult.txt         -device
  virtserialport,chardev=3Dstatus         -monitor none         -kernel
  wireguard-testing-harness-bzImage-e87cb2a7-145c-4985-907f-17e81fae329b
  -append "console=3Dhvc0 initcall_debug=3D1 loglevel=3D7" ) ; do echo $n ;
  n=3D$(expr $n + 1) ; pkill -f wireguard ; done

  This typically does 10-20 iterations but sometimes tens of iterations
  run without issue.
