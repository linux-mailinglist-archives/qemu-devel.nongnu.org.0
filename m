Looking through old bug tickets... is this still an issue with the
latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  Auto resize VM doesn't work with windows 10 guest

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I,m using a Ubuntu 15.04 host and a windows 10 guest (both 64 bit) on
  a intel i7 proc. My ubuntu system is up-to-date and I'm using QEMU
  emulator version 2.2.0. I use virt-manager 1.0.1 and SPICE guest tools
  0.100 are installed on the guest.

  With the exactly same setup and a windows 7 guest I can set "Auto
  resize VM with window" and it perfectly works. After installing SPICE
  in windows 10 I can still select this box, but it doesn't work any
  longer.
