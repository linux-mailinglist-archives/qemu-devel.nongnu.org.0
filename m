Yes, it's also tracked under LP#1830864; thanks for looking into it.

So, I've just retested, with the QEMU binary I've left around from last
time. (This QEMU binary was built at upstream commit d247c8e7f4fc, with
Phil's v2 series applied on top, for regression testing:

[PATCH v2 0/9] hw/block/pflash_cfi01: Add DeviceReset() handler

http://mid.mail-archive.com/38281fa7-30f4-60ec-3357-3e1613c44dbe@redhat.com
)

The issue still reproduces, so it makes sense for me to look at the host
kernel version... Well, I'm afraid it won't help much, for an upstream
investigation:

  4.14.0-115.8.2.el7a.aarch64

This is the latest released kernel from "Red Hat Enterprise Linux for
ARM 64 7".

Thanks!
Laszlo
