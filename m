That would be a concern for the NBD server. I'm not sure if anything in
QEMU ever waits for NBD servers (except for the client on the other side
of the connection, of course), so there might be no use case for yanking
their connections.

Anyway, here we were talking about the NBD client, which always accesses
one disk. If you access a second disk, you have a second NBD block node.
