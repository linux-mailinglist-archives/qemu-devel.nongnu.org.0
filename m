Sorry for leaving this one hanging again. Some initial general

I've looked through the patches, and I think my current concerns
(stated briefly) are:
 * I don't think we have the "don't call device implementations of
   reset phase functions multiple times" semantics that I wanted;
   OTOH I think the logic I suggested for those in comments on the
   v1 of this series wouldn't work either.
 * handling of "call the parent class's reset" is not very clean
   (but this is a general QOM design issue)
 * migration (see below)

Sounds good.

Users of this function:
 hw/audio/intel-hda.c
  -- used by the HDA device to reset the HDACodecDevice, which has
     no child buses
 hw/hyperv/hyperv.c
  -- resets the SynICState, which I think has no child buses
 hw/i386/pc.c
  -- resets the APIC, which has no child buses. (This reset is only
     done as a workaround for lack of reset phases: the whole machine
     is reset and then the APIC is re-reset last to undo any changes
     that other devices might have made to it. Probably making the APIC
     support phased reset would allow us to drop this hack.)
 hw/ide/microdrive.c
  -- called here to reset the MicroDriveState object. This does have
     a child bus, but md_reset() explicitly calls ide_bus_reset(),
     so it should be possible to clean this up.
 hw/intc/spapr_xive.c
  -- resets the SpaprXive device, which I think has no child buses
 hw/ppc/pnv_psi.c
  -- resets a XiveSource, which I think has no child buses
 hw/ppc/spapr_pci.c
  -- resets every QOM child of the SpaprPhbState. This one will
     require closer checking, but my guess is that if there's a child
     with a child bus then failure to reset the bus would be a bug.
 hw/ppc/spapr_vio.c
  -- resets an SpaprTceTable. This needs attention from an Spapr
     expert but is probably ok.
 hw/s390x/s390-pci-inst.c
  -- resets the S390PCIBusDevice. Needs S390 expertise, but probably
     either no child buses or failure to reset them is a bug.
 hw/scsi/vmw_pvscsi.c
  -- resets an individual SCSIDevice. I don't think those have child buses.
 hw/sd/omap_mmc.c
  -- resetting an SDState, which has no child bus
 hw/sd/pl181.c
  -- ditto.

So there are one or two not-totally-trivial cases but we should
be able to deal with these.

I think it should be possible to do the conversion mechanically
(eg with coccinelle). We can look at doing that later.

The approach I thought would be good turns out not to actually work,
so I need to think a bit more about this.

I think what I would like to achieve is "default to doing the right
thing" -- ideally devices that add support for being held in reset
should not need to manually do something to make the bus/device reset
state be migrated properly. Otherwise we have an easy mistake to
make (forgetting to do the necessary handling of migration) when
adding a new device or making a device support being held in reset.

Regarding "devices not supporting staying in reset state without
manual intervention" do you mean that they might not correctly
deal with incoming signals or guest register write attempts
in the held-in-reset state? That's true, but I don't think it's
too terrible. (In particular it's a bug that can be fixed without
breaking migration compatibility; and it seems unlikely that guest
software would be trying to read or write a device that it's put
into reset.)

thanks
