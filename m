Thx! Of course I am interested in helping and I think it is actually great 
idea to have couple of designated maintainers/reviewers as it would be easier
for folks to receive feedback vs requesting it in polling manner :)
And please don't get me wrong -- I'm not complaining about anything -- I
think it is just reality that everybody is stretched out into multiple directions
struggling to allocate time for multiple things. Having many people will
actually increase likelihood of introducing high quality improvements.

Also, +1 on separate tree for nvme emulation.
