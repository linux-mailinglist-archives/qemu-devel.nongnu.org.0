Yes, some MMIOs that I'm at least aware of are IO_APIC_DEFAULT_ADDRESS
(0xfec00000), TPM_PPI_ADDR_BASE (0xFED45000), APIC_DEFAULT_ADDRESS
(0xfee00000).

They are not directly adjacent with pflash; nor should they be.

On one hand, the current FLASH_SIZE_LIMIT is meant to be  sufficient for
a long time ("should be enough for anyone").

On the other hand, if we have a really strong reason to increase the
size limit, the current value is supposed to give us a safety margin, so
that we can satisfy the immediate need at that point *first*, and start
looking into (likely more intrusive) physical address map changes, to
restore the safety margin.

If you increase the size limit (without tieing it to a machine type),
then, with an upgraded QEMU and the same (old) machine type, you can
start a guest with a larger-than-earlier (cumulative) flash size. Then,
when you try to migrate this to an old QEMU (but same machine type),
it's a bad surprise. I understand that backwards migration is not
universally supported (or expected), but I don't want this problem to
land on my desk *ever*.

Furthermore, un-enumerable / platform-MMIO devices tend to pop up time
after time. TPM_PPI_ADDR_BASE (0xFED45000) is a somewhat recent
addition, for example. It's not like we're never going to need more
address space up there.

Yes, in part because I strive to keep it that way. I fight to keep out
all cruft that I can (at least by conditionalizing it) so that there is
room for the stuff that I cannot keep out. (And I always strive to set
expectations that flipping all possible build knobs in OVMF to "on" may
very well cause an "out of space" error.)

- I've made sure that PVSCSI_ENABLE and MPT_SCSI_ENABLE be stand-alone
config knobs. The use case behind them is valid, the drivers are open
source, but the use case is still niche, so they must be easy to keep out.

- I've made sure LSI_SCSI_ENABLE is a stand-alone config knob too (and
it even defaults to FALSE). The QEMU device that the driver drives is
obsolete / deprecated.

- If VMBus drivers are ever going to be contributed, they'll need a
config knob.

- Current Xen code in OVMF is supposed to be separated completely to the
new, dedicated XenPVH platform
<https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2122>.

- Bhyve support is a separate platform build.

- Capsule updates are not supported by OVMF, and if they will ever be,
they're going to have to be a separate firmware platform. Datacenter
virtualization has no use for capsule updates.

- The next big thing I expect to have to keep out of OVMF is Redfish
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)>. Libvirt,
OpenStack, Cockpit, Kubernetes already handle that area *underneath* the
guest, I believe. (It's OK to use OVMF for developing / testing Redfish;
it's not OK to expect that the current OVMF firmware platform contain
everything that it contains now *plus* Redfish.)

Sparse is *good*.

Which is arguably completely superfluous on every possible platform one
can imagine. On the other hand, if you want a real serial port on
workstation class hardware, you may have to order a separate part (if
you are lucky and you *can* order one). Serial-over-LAN is a complete
non-replacement.

The reason (should I say: excuse) for the firmware to exist is to (a)
boot operating systems, (b) abstract away some ugly platform-specific
hardware for OS runtime (by providing ACPI and SMBIOS descriptions, and
a *small* set of runtime services). We can maybe add (c) "root of trust".

In practice, physical firmware is becoming the hw vendor's OS before
(and under) your OS, one you cannot replace, and one whose updates can
brick your hardware. Permitting the same feature creep on virtual
platforms is wrong.

Key term being "open uses". Let us see them.

I do. Software and data always expand to consume all available space,
and it's going to cause a conflict between UEFI features and platform
MMIO sooner or later. Then I'll get the privilege of shuffling around
the crap in OVMF (all of which is "indispensable" or course).

If we ever go down this route, it needs to benefit open source directly
and significantly.
