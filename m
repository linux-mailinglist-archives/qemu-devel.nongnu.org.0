Hello,

Jumping in the middle of this thread, so I apologize if some of my
comments are a bit out of context.

I don't think this would be the right level of abstraction. The V4L2 API
is way too low-level when it comes to camera paravirtualization (and may
not be the only API we'll have in the future). I thus recommend
virtualizing cameras with a higher-level API, more or less on top of
libcamera or the Android camera HAL (they both sit at the same level in
the camera stack). Anything lower than that won't be practical.
