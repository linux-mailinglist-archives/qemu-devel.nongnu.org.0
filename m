I'd certainly give it a try! Launchpad is IMHO really a pain (let me know if
I should elaborate on that topic again...), and the email bridge is often
also not working correctly (replies to bug mails sometimes get put into the
bug tracker, sometimes not), so this is not something I would really miss
when we quite Launchpad.

So could somebody please enable the issue tracker there, so we can give it a
try? Phil? Alex? Stefan? ...?

If it works well, I can certainly help to get the links etc. in our website
fixed.
