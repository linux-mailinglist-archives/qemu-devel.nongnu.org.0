I don't believe there's any notification.

Some of our targets are obviously much more important and
frequently changed than others.  For contributors our goal is
to mimimize breakage after patches are submitted. Most of our
contributors changes will be well covered by x86-64 + aarch64
alone. Other targets give varying degrees of extra benefit.

On the other hand the contributors are likely to have tested
x86_64 or aarch64 themselves since that'll be their dev
platform. So the benefit of CI is testing bits that they
didnt bother to test.

No clear easy answer here, but I feel like we could benefit
from classifying our target archs tier 1/2/3 and tailoring
our default testing matrix accordingly.

The other way to cut down the "minimal" set is to reduce
the OS containers that we build. The jobs above end up
requiring something like 8 container builds - we should
try to cut this down to perhaps 2-3 container builds

With my contributor hat on, I like GitLab CI to validate the platforms
I always forget. Changes I do are 95% tested on Fedora x86_64. I have
often broken stuff for non-Linux builds (Windows in particular), or
have broken non-x86_64 target arches. CI lets me see this before
sending patches.  Unfortunately this means I benefit most from the
"full" set, but this won't be sustainable with limited CI minutes :-(

When I'm working on changing gitlab CI rules, then I burn loads of
minutes which is especially troubling - limited CI minutes will make
it very hard for me to debug future CI rule changes :-(

Yes, I think that 'minimal' ought to be a good "smoke test" to run
when queuing changes, on the assumption you'll run a full/gating set
before sending the final pull.

Yeah, the full/gating set is what I would thing subsys maintainers
would want to use, to minimize risk that Peter's tests throw back
the merge due to failure. The only difference of gating vs full
is whether the acceptance tests run.

We've got various make targets right now, but they don't guide users
as to what is the most beneficial thing to run.

I think ultimately we should be looking to take email out of the loop
for merging pull requests from subsys maintainers.

If we expect subsys maintainers to use gitlab CI before sending, then
we have a crazy situation where subsys maintainers pushes to gitlab,
has CI run, then send email PULL to list, then Peter downloads and
applies the mails, and pushes back to gitlab and runs CI again and
then pushes to gitlab again for master.

It would be much simpler if the subsys maintainer pushes to gitlab
and opens a merge request. This would trigger the CI gating runs,
consuming minutes from the QEMU project, not the maintainer. Peter
can ignore merge request until CI passes. The subsys maintainer
is responsible for getting CI to pass. Once CI passes, the merge
request could be apporved and merged. The person approving it for
merge should really only need to validate the the non-automatable
stuff. eg it meets the current freeze rules; the maintainer is
the owner of the subsystem being modified, etc.

Of course this relies on us being able to use GitLab for 100% of
merge time gating. Cleber's custom runners recently enabled get
us closer, but I think Peter still uses some other hardware
outside of GitLab for some testing.

Daniel
