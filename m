Hi Kirti:

What kind of platform/IO are you using now to do the basic code
verification?

I just want to check if I can verify it on my platform, and if any open
IO cards available?=20

Thanks.

Regards
Zengtao=20

> This patch set adds:
> * New IOCTL VFIO_IOMMU_DIRTY_PAGES to get dirty pages bitmap with

>   This ioctl is also used to start/stop dirty pages tracking for pinned a=
nd
>   unpinned pages while migration is active.
>=20
> * Updated IOCTL VFIO_IOMMU_UNMAP_DMA to get dirty pages bitmap
> before
>   unmapping IO virtual address range.
>   With vIOMMU, during pre-copy phase of migration, while CPUs are
> still
>   running, IO virtual address unmap can happen while device still

>=20

>   smart to report pages to be marked dirty by pinning pages using
>   vfio_pin_pages() API.
>=20
>=20
> Yet TODO:
> Since there is no device which has hardware support for system

> v11 -> v12
> - Changed bitmap allocation in vfio_iommu_type1.
> - Remove atomicity of ref_count.
> - Updated comments for migration device state structure about error

> - Nit picks from v11 reviews

> - Nit picks from v10 reviews
>=20
> v9 -> v10:

>   during unmap while migration is active
> - Added flag in VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO to indicate driver support dirty

> - Added unpinned pages tracking while migration is active.
> - Updated comments for migration device state structure with bit

>=20
> v8 -> v9:
> - Split patch set in 2 sets, Kernel and QEMU.
> - Dirty pages bitmap is queried from IOMMU container rather than from
>   vendor driver for per device. Added 2 ioctls to achieve this.
>=20
> v7 -> v8:
> - Updated comments for KABI
> - Added BAR address validation check during PCI device's config space

>   as suggested by Dr. David Alan Gilbert.
> - Changed vfio_migration_set_state() to set or clear device state flags.
> - Some nit fixes.
>=20
> v6 -> v7:
> - Fix build failures.
>=20
> v5 -> v6:
> - Fix build failure.
>=20
> v4 -> v5:
> - Added decriptive comment about the sequence of access of members
> of
>   structure vfio_device_migration_info to be followed based on Alex's
>   suggestion
> - Updated get dirty pages sequence.
> - As per Cornelia Huck's suggestion, added callbacks to VFIODeviceOps to
>   get_object, save_config and load_config.
> - Fixed multiple nit picks.
> - Tested live migration with multiple vfio device assigned to a VM.
>=20
> v3 -> v4:
> - Added one more bit for _RESUMING flag to be set explicitly.
> - data_offset field is read-only for user space application.
> - data_size is read for every iteration before reading data from
> migration,
>   that is removed assumption that data will be till end of migration
>   region.
> - If vendor driver supports mappable sparsed region, map those region

> - Handles race condition that causes data corruption in migration region
>   during save device state by adding mutex and serialiaing save_buffer
> and
>   get_dirty_pages routines.
> - Skip called get_dirty_pages routine for mapped MMIO region of device.
> - Added trace events.
> - Split into multiple functional patches.
>=20
> v2 -> v3:
> - Removed enum of VFIO device states. Defined VFIO device state with 2
>   bits.
> - Re-structured vfio_device_migration_info to keep it minimal and
> defined
>   action on read and write access on its members.
>=20
> v1 -> v2:

> - Re-structured vfio_device_migration_info. This structure will be placed

> - Replaced ioctl with read/write for trapped part of migration region.

> - Moved PCI device functions to pci file.
