I can understand that. This follows the whole "each patch should be
sufficient on its own" way of thinking. A switch with no cases and a
default _does_ look silly.

Sounds good. I'll takes this into consideration for the next round. (I
may wait just a little longer for that to allow more reviews to come in
from whoever has the time, if that's okay.)
