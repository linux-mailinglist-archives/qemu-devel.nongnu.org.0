I would ask what you see as the long term future usage for 'virt' vs
'minic' machine types ? Would you expect all existing users of 'virt'
to ultimately switch to 'minic', or are there distinct non-overlapping
use cases for 'virt' vs 'minic' such that both end up widely used ?

Is 'minic' intended to be able to mimic real physical hardware at all,
or is it still intended as a purely virtual machine, like a 'virt-ng' ?

Essentially 'virt' was positioned as the standard machine to use if
you want to run a virtual machine, without any particular match to
physical hardware. It feels like 'minic' is creating a second machine
type to fill the same purpose, so how do users decide which to use ?
