https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3366
is probably relevant here: the regex controlling what Sphinx
thinks is a valid option string was relaxed.

The "1.4 fails with duplicate ID warnings" part is probably
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/646
which is a similar earlier issue where the option string
was relaxed to include the '.' character. Without that
Sphinx misparses all the "encrypt.format", "encrypt.key-secret", etc
options of the qcow2 block driver as being a single "encrypt" option
with an argument ".format", ".key-secret", etc and thinks they're
duplicates.

I think we should do this for 5.0. My guess is that most users
building QEMU on older distros aren't actually interested in
building the documentation, so they'll be better off having
configure automatically disable docs building and getting a
working binary rather than having it try to build the docs
and then failing. If they really want the docs they'll have
a clear reason why which will point them in the right direction.

PS: why 1.6.1 and not 1.6.0? You don't list 1.6.0 in your set of
things you tested, was it just that you couldn't find it?

thanks
