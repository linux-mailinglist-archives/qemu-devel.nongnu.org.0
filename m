Right.  I think this is a valid perspective to consider as we define
the order and scope of thanks.  I'll follow up with a more
straightforward suggestion with the bare minimum actions for a first
round.

I absolutely agree.  That's why I even considered *if* this will done,
and not only *when*.  Because I happen to be biased from working on a
test runner/framework, this is something that I had to at least talk
about, so that it can be evaluated and maybe turned into a goal.

OK, I get your point.  But, I think it's fair to say though, that one
big motivation that we also have for this work, is to be able to
provide new machines and jobs into the Gating CI in the very near
future.  And to do that, we must set common rules so that anyone
else can do the same and abide by the same terms.

So, in your opinion, this is phase >=3D 1 material.  Noted.

I've successfully built gitlab-runner and run jobs on aarch64, ppc64le
and s390x.  The binaries are available here:

   https://cleber.fedorapeople.org/gitlab-runner/v12.4.1/

But, with the "shell" executor (given that Docker helper images are
not available for those architectures).  I don't think we'd have to
depend on GitLab providing those images though, it should be possible
to create them for different architectures and tweak the gitlab-runner
code to use different image references on those architectures.

Does this answer this specific question?

Best,
