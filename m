Right.

It does not.  And while making an exact version match requirement
between plugins and core Avocado would be easy, it would put unfair
(IMO) requirements on plugin writers.  It's quite possible that
an external plugin would work for many different avocado versions,
and the author wouldn't feel like updating it just to satisfy the
version check.

I'm not quite sure we should be trying to solve this problem here, but
I'm open to suggestions.
