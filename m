Good point, we would have to keep the comment parser either way to be
used on top of the YAML (or whatever) parser.

Whatever parser we use would have to actually make comments available
rather than immediately filtering them out. This might exist for most
languages, but it will probably not be the most commonly used parser
either (or at least it will not allow using a simple interface like
json.loads() in Python).

We use a similar (same?) form of "almost JSON" for QMP which will still
exist. So we'd be moving from having to learn one (non-standard)
language to two languages (one still non-standard and another one that
is hopefully more standard).

This is mostly the editor question this patch was about, right? Or are
people trying to use more sophisticated tools on it?

I don't think this is something any of the suggested languages would
address.

Has anyone looked into what error messages are like for the suggested
alternatives? "error reporting could be better" is something that is
true for a lot of software.

The doc comment part is not going to change unless we get rid of
comments and actually make documentation part of the objects themselves.
This might not be very readable.

Or I should rather say, making the doc comment part change is possible,
but would require the same changes as with our current lower layer
language and parser.

Do other programs that go beyond syntax highlighting actually get to
parse our QAPI schema definitions? Or would they rather deal with the
return value of query-qmp-schema?

Neither the QAPI schema nor a YAML file with the same structure are a
standard approach to describe JSON documents. So even if we replace JSON
in the lower layer, the whole thing (and as you say, the upper layer is
the more interesting part) still stays non-standard in a way and more
advanced tools can't be used with it.

And of course, even if we did use something more standard like JSON
Schema or whatever exists for YAML, we would still have to massively
extend it because the QAPI schema contains much more information than
just what would be needed to validate some input. We control all aspects
of generated C code with it.
