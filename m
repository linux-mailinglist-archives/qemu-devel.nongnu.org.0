After Markus's patches probably nothing uses it any more but this comes 
with the result that previously giving some random value such as -m 100 
did produce a working sam460ex machine after some warnings but now it just 
thows back some errors to the user which may or may not be helpful to 
them.

Maybe testing with the biggest valid value such as -m 2048 (that's 
commonly used probably) and an invalid value such as -m 100 might be 
enough. Testing all possible values might take too long and would not test 
what happens with invalid values. Ideally those invalud values should also 
work like before a0258e4afa but should at least give a meaningful warning 
so the user can fix the command line without too much head scratching. 
Actually that commit was from Igor not from Marcus so sorry for 
attributing that to Marcus too, I remembered wrong.

By the way you could argue that on real machine you cannot plug certain 
combinations of memory modules so it's enough to model that but I think 
QEMU does not have to be that strict and also support configs that cannot 
happen on real hadware but would work. This might be useful for example if 
you have some ammount of memory to set aside for a VM on a host but that's 
not a size that exists in memory modules on real hardware. This also works 
on pc machine in qemu-system-i386 for example: it accepts -m 100 and does 
its best to create a machine with such unrealistic size. The sam460ex did 
the same (within SoC's limits) and before a0258e4afa -m 100 was fixed up 
to 96 MB which is now not possible due to change in QEMU internal APIs. 
This probably isn't important enough to worth the extra effort to support 
but would have been nice to preserve.
