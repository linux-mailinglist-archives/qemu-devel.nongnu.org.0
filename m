Even if QEMU copies and transfers content of all sys mem pages during 
pre-copy (worst case with IOMMU backed mdev device when its vendor 
driver is not smart to pin pages explicitly and all sys mem pages are 
marked dirty), then also its prediction about downtime tolerance will 
not be correct, because during stop-and-copy again all pages need to be 
copied as device can write to any of those pinned pages.
