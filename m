But in the qemu-img convert case specifically, multi-conn should
be safe for writing?

One additional problem with multi-conn is that NBD servers only
advertise that the feature is present, not the best possible degree of
parallelism to use.  (It's possible that the server cannot or doesn't
know this.)

I should say first that I've nearly finished an nbdkit filter
implementation of this, so feel free to ignore this for qemu.

The background to this feature is that some block device backends do
not have support for determining extents / disk block allocation
status.  The one that is most frequently used is ssh (sftp).  Note
that adding this support to sftp, while possible, doesn't really solve
the problem because the proprietary hypervisors we are pulling from
don't use recent SSH servers.

So copying from SSH is slow because you have no choice except to read
vast amounts of zeroes or deleted data.  (This doesn't affect virt-v2v
because it has another strategy to avoid this, but it does affect
other scenarios such as "warm" conversions and any migration that
doesn't involve using virt-v2v.)

However you can get the extent information by other means.  For VMware
you can use VMOMI to read this.  Or you can ssh in and run commands
like xfs_bmap.

So in theory at least it's possible to assemble the required data
from multiple sources and thus avoid wasteful copying.

With nbdkit you'll be able to do something like:

  # fetch the extents list over VMOMI > extents.txt, then
  nbdkit -U /tmp/sock --filter=3Dextentlist ssh \
                   host=3Dserver /vmfs/.../file-flat.vmdk \
                   extentlist=3Dextents.txt
  qemu-img convert nbd:unix:/tmp/sock ...

Yes this makes sense.

If qemu-img doesn't have the data (we have to get it from
another source), is the output of qemu-img map relevant?
