Did this fall through the cracks?

Yes, reading one byte at a time is awful.  But QMP is control plane; I
didn't expect it to impact system performance.  How are you using QMP?
Just curious, not actually opposed to improving QMP efficiency.

This looks suspicious.  It's a request count, not a byte count.  Can you
explain what led you to change it this way?

The ramifications are not obvious to me.  I think I need to (re-)examine
how QMP reads input, with special consideration to its OOB feature.
