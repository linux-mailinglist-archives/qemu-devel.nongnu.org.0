Eduardo posted a patch to HACKING to clarify this non-usage of typedef
is okay.

Should we continue to mandate typedef names elsewhere?  It adds
cognitive load: you have to decide where to put the typedef, and when
not to use it.

Yes, and if this leads to an inclusion cycle, I strongly suspect "fat"
headers: since you can't embed something in itself, the cycle must
involve different things, all bunched together in the same header.

This series grows it some.  I'll try to avoid that for v2.

On the other hand, low-hanging fruit.
