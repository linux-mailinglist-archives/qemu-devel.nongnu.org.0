fyi, that was to avoid shipping pre-compiled binaries:
https://salsa.debian.org/qemu-team/edk2/commit/d46a08968a1609725215f32230ab1ddd35d8b7fb

But I just uploaded a new version w/ this change that gets around it:
https://salsa.debian.org/qemu-team/edk2/commit/bfe4fc20408f35ffaa196817b57df11981eef620
