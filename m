I was trying to avoid having so make "check-acceptance-*" rules that just
choosing one would be harder than writing an Avocado command line from
scratch... but I think you have a point here.  For once, this can be
used in a Travis job with an special "allow_failures" option set.

I guess you mean the Avocado Job concept, and writing your own runner
based on those APIs.  If so, then absolutely yes.  I've shared with
Eduardo some of the use cases that we can solve much easily.  But, we
need to finish the last bits on the Avocado side, properly document
and support the API before attempting to use it here on QEMU.

Yes, you have a point about "yet another set of tests".  I think that,
whenever we break the limit of expressiveness with something like the
current incarnation of tags (which shouldn't need much explanation)
then it's time to rely on something that has all the expressiveness
and doesn't impose any other restrictions.

I'm refering to the previous idea about using the Job API, and
creating customized runner that, with the expressiveness of Python
code, can choose tests for different scenarios.  What I don't think
we should try to do, is to come up with yet another language, or YAML
parser, or anything along those lines.

Yep, that I also agree 100%.
