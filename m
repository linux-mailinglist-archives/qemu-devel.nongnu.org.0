We don't support concurrent modification. But if the guest is running=20
and unmaps things, then shuts off, then we edit the raw file offline,=20
then we restart the guest, the guest should see the results of those=20
offline edits.

We have to special-case the qcow2 code to either treat unallocated=20
cluster + raw-data-file as not really unallocated (so that we can see=20
those edits), or we have to special case it to handle unmap +=20
raw-data-file specially (pass unmap to the raw file, but do NOT mark the=20
cluster unallocated in the qcow2 wrapper).  Which special case we choose=20
for unmap may in turn affect whether it is easier to require=20
preallocation=3Dmetadata (because we can now guarantee that no cluster=20
will ever be marked unallocated in qcow2) or whether the default=20
preallocation of leaving clusters "unallocated" in qcow2 still sees the=20
proper guest data.
