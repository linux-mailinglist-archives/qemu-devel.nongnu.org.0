I agree.

> this is not a resource availability or reservation interface.  The fact
I also agree. The migration_version (version in this case is not really=20
a good fit) is a summary of requirements the source mdev has which a=20
target mdev needs to be able to fulfill in order to allow migration.
The target mdev already exists and was already configured by other means=20
not involved in the migration check process.
Using the migrations_version as some kind of configuration transport=20
and/or reservation mechanism wasn't my intention and IMHO would both be=20
wrong.
