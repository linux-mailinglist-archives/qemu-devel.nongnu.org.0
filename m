The pread will hang in attaching disk just when backend storage network=20
disconnection .

I think the locking range of qemu_global_mutex is too large when do qmp=20
operation. what

does the qemu_global_mutex=C2=A0 really protect?=C2=A0 what is the risk o=
f=20
unlocking qemu_global_mutex

in qmp?
