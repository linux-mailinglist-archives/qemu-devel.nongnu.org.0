But what is exactly the benefit? It is not going to change. I can look into making it a .S, compile it to a binary an 
include this binary into qemu-system-ppc64 as a byte array, just need to refresh my gcc/ldd memories but a separate file 
is too much for this imho.

I keep secure VMs in mind. And SLOF is a separate package, why was not RTAS?

Yes.

We already have predefined values for phandles we care about.

fdt_splice_() fails because of lack of space in the FDT (you pointed to it below). Not calling fdt_pack() fixed it as it 
just keeps FDT blob rather big. Not sure it is worth further optimizations at this point.

I dropped fdt_pack() and change properties via fdt_setprop() - works just fine.

I do not require it. It is purely for debugging. You can basically set address to 0, run qemu with -s and do step 
debugging with debug symbols from vmlinux (well, keep switching endianness), otherwise you would need to calculate 
offset (0x400000 or whatever it is) for every breakpoint you set. Once I passed the prom_init() debugging stage (which 
did not work because I did not provide stack), I have not used it for last couple of days.

So I could ditch it now but we could use it to reduce (small but still) memory fragmentation by placing vmlinux at 0. Dunno.

Well, I used to add phandles before calling fdt_pack() so it is not exactly the same.

This is what I ended up doing.

True to a degree. It is "setprop" to the current fdt blob which we do not analyze after we build the fdt. We either need 
to do parse the tree before we rebuild it as CAS so we do not lose the updates or do selective changes to the QEMUs 
objects from the "setprop" handler (this is what I do now). Thanks,
