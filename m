I fully agree with you, and the whole thing did felt kind of wrong.
I kind of think that bdrv_co_create_opts is kind of outdated for the purp=
ose, especially
with the nvme driver.
I think that it would be better if the bdrv_file_open just supported some=
thing like 'O_CREAT'.

I done this the mostly the same was as the file-posix does this on the bl=
ock devices,
including that 'hack' of zeroing the first sector, for which I really don=
't know if this is the right solution.

For existing images, the 'bdrv_create_file' is already kind of a nop, oth=
er that zeroing the first sector,
which kind of makes sense, but probably best done on higher level than in=
 each driver.

So these are my thoughts about this, thanks for the review!
