to begin with, users shouldn't have used 'dies' with initial impl. at all.
(it was Intel introduced option and EPYC's added very similar internal node=
_id
(removed by the next patch)).
Now we are trying to consolidate this mess and reuse dies for EPYC.

EPYC was out in the since with 5.0 (though broken), users could start a VM =
with
such config but that would not be correct EPYC from apicid and cpuid point =
of view.
Guest OS might run if it doesn't know about EPYCs or behave wierdly (sub op=
timal|crash|whatever)
on seeing unexpected values.

If we are hell bound on keeping bugs of initial impl, then we should keep i=
t to 5.1<=3D
machine version and do the right thing for newer ones.
Though I'm not sure we should keep broken variant around (all we would get =
from it is
bug reports*/complains from users with end result of their config anyways).
I'd rather error out with clear error message so user could fix their broke=
n config.

*) there is at least one thread/bz on qemu-devel where users are trying to =
run
with EPYC and pick up options combination so it would produce sensible topo=
logy.
