And the librbd code doesn=E2=80=99t alleviate my concerns.

=46rom what I can see, it first creates a bitmap (two bits per entry) tha=
t
covers the whole image and says which objects are allocated and which
aren=E2=80=98t.  Through the whole chain, that is.  So in the above examp=
le, the
bitmap would report everything as allocated.  (Or rather =E2=80=9Cupdated=
=E2=80=9C in
librbd=E2=80=98s terms.)

Then it has this piece:

So that iterates over the whole image (in our case, because m_offset is
0 and m_length is the image length), then picks out a chunk of read_len
length, converts that to objects, and then iterates over all of those
objects and all of their extents.

file_to_extents looks like it=E2=80=99s just an arithmetic operation.  So=
 it
doesn=E2=80=98t look like that function returns extents in multiple snaps=
hots.
It just converts a range into subranges called =E2=80=9Cobjects=E2=80=9D =
and =E2=80=9Cextents=E2=80=9D
(at least that=E2=80=99s the way it looks to me).

So overall, this looks awfully like it simply iterates over the whole
image and then returns allocation information gathered as a top-down
view through all of the snapshots, but not for each snapshot individually=
