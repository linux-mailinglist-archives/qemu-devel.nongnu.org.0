Hi,  Alistair

In my opinion, the CLIC code almost works.
  
Last year when my workmate ported an RTOS, I once read the CLIC specification and used the CLIC model code. It worked through  all the tests after fixed two bugs. I also had sent the patch to Michael, but without response(maybe a wrong email address).

After that, the specification has updated and the code may changed. I didn't pull new code again.

If the CLIC model may merged into the mainline, and no body maintain the code, I'd like to work on it, fixing the bugs and updating the code according to latest specification.
