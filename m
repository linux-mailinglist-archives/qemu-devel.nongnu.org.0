This is common for onboard devices.  I hate it.

Some boards do better than others.  For instance, ast2600-evb has 33
sensibly named entries under /machine/soc/, and only 9 entries in the
/machine/unattached/ orphanage.  i440fx has two sensible named ones
under /machine/, and 26 in the orphanage.

As long as the final canonical path component is something readable
rather than auto-generated crap like "device[6]",
object_get_canonical_path_component() is usable for tracing.

"bus=3D11 addr=3D0x60" isn't exactly wonderful, but it seems practical
enough for me.  Even "device[6]" seems workable, just bothersome,
because it's needlessly hard to remember, and prone to change.

Mind, I'm not recommending any particular solution for "want a more
useful device ID in traces", I'm just throwing out ideas on how to solve
the problem in a more general way.

Working towards a a neater QOM composition tree might help with more
than tracing.
