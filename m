No, but I think its none the less useful to consider what impact is
on distribution of binaries. Currently Stefan builds & distributes
the QEMU Windows binaries for each release. I think the ideal would
be for Windows builds to be a core deliverable of the upstram release
process. So this docker CI job can be viewed as a stepping stone to
that point, especially if it is made to run the full NSIS installer
build, not just standalone binary build.
