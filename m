I'm not burying anything.  This patch is stand alone and all the tests =
do work.  They work with or without Cedric's nee Andrew's patch.  But, =
if some derivative of that patch is eventually implemented, something =
needs to be done for this NRF51 gpio qtest to work.

There are two possibilities for the following qtest in microbit-test.c:

>     actual =3D qtest_readl(qts, NRF51_GPIO_BASE + =
NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END) & 0x01;
>     g_assert_cmpuint(actual, =3D=3D, 0x01);


1 - The code is purposefully reading 32-bits from an unaligned address =
which only partially refers to a documented register.  And the only =
reason this code works is because that 32-bit value is turned into a =
8-bit read.  And if that's the case, then someone should update a =
comment in the test to indicate that this is being done purposefully.
2 - NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END is incorrectly set to be 0x77F.  Looking at =
the documentation for this chip, the last defined CNF register starts at =
0x77C.

The NRF51 doesn't support unaligned accesses, so I assume that =
possibility 1 isn't true.

So, is NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END supposed to refer to a valid register, or =
the end of the implementation space?

If it's the former, then it should be adjusted to 0x77c and possibly =
update the below code in nrf51_gpio.c (line 156):

>     case NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_START ... NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END:


to become

>     case NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_START ... NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END + 3:

if unaligned access are expected to work.  But, considering the NRF51 =
doesn't support unaligned accesses, I don't think this appropriate.

If it's the latter, then the test cases in microbit-test.c should be =
updated to something like the following:

>     actual =3D qtest_readl(qts, NRF51_GPIO_BASE + =
NRF51_GPIO_REG_CNF_END - 3) & 0x01;
>     g_assert_cmpuint(actual, =3D=3D, 0x01);
