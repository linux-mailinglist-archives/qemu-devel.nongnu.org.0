They look very different in syntax because they are taking two differnet
approaches.

The cryptsetup approach is functional, where the user states what action
they want performed.

The qemu-img amend approach is declarative, where the user expresses what
end state they want the image to be in.

The challenge is that the qemu-img proposal isn't fully declarative as
we are only partially expressing the end state, attempting to leave other
slots unspecified. This is good as it means we don't have to specify a
huge amount of data on the CLI. This is bad as makes it less obvious
what actual effects of the commands will be and I feel users will end
up needing to read the manual every time to re-learn it.

Daniel
