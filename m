I see now what you meant. I think it is possible but the cold/warm make
it more complicated. It will need a "get_reset_kind" method which
returns whether it's cold or warm.

Is it the current good way of doing this ? (some kind of
override_this_parent_method function)

Thanks for listing theses. Do you think I should includes all the
switches in the series or just the trivial ones ?

To have a default behavior, we need to somehow handle that in the
DeviceClass.
Ideally speaking, this subsection could be handled during the device
realization, when the vmsd is registered. But since we cannot
dynamically add a new subsection to the device vmsd structure, we have
to forge an extended new one (the same with additional subsection). It
seems technically possible but this feels like a bad hacky idea.

Yes it is what I meant.
