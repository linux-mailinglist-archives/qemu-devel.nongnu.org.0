The interface pretends the parameters are all independent: you get to
set them one by one.

They are in fact not independent, and this now leads to difficulties.

To avoid them, the interface should let you specify a desired
configuration all at once, and its implementation should then do what it
takes to get from here to there.

Example: current state is multifd compression method "zstd", compression
level is 19.  User wants to switch to method "zlib" level 9 the obvious
way

    With old interface:
        step 1: set method to "zlib"
        step 2: set level to 9
    Problem: after step 1, we have method "zlib" with invalid level 19.
    Workaround: swap the steps.

    Note that the workaround only works because the set of levels both
    methods support is non-empty.  We might still come up with more
    complicated parameter combinations where that is not the case.

    With new interface:
        set compression to "zlib" level 9

The new interface require us to specify a QAPI type capable of holding
the complete migration configuration.

The stupid way is to throw all migration parameters into a struct, and
make the ones optional that apply only when others have certain values.
Thus, the "applies only when" bits are semantical, documented in
comments, and enforced by C code.

With a bit more care, we can make "applies only when" syntactical
instead.  Examples:

    @max-bandwidth and @downtime-limit always apply.  They go straight
    into the struct.

    @tls-creds, @tls-hostname, @tls-authz apply only when TLS is enabled
    by setting @tls-creds.  Have an optional member @tls, which is a
    struct with mandatory member @creds, optional members @hostname,
    @authz.

    @multifd-zlib-level applies when @multifd-method is "zlib", and
    @multifd-zstd-level applies when it's "zstd".  Have a union
    @multifd-compression, cases "none", "zlib" and "zstd", where each
    case's members are the parameters applying in that case.

Please note the purpose of these examples is to show how things can be
done in the schema.  I'm not trying to tell you how these specific
things *should* be done.

The resulting type is perfectly suited as return value of a query
command.  It's awkward as argument of a "specify desired configuration"
command, because it requires the user to specify *complete*
configuration.  If we want to support omitting the parts of it we don't
want to change, we have to make more members optional.  Imprecise for
the query, where we now have to specify "always present" in comments.
Usually less bad than duplicating a complex type.

Hope this helps some.
