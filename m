sysemu/sysemu.h declares qemu_semihosting_config_opts,
hw/semihosting/config.c and stubs/semihost.c define it.

Gcc warns when you do that for functions (-Wmissing-declarations
-Wmissing-prototypes), but not for variables.  I like to include the
header anyway, to make sure the compiler checks the declaration is
consistent with the definition.

I'm not sure I'm following you.

What would you like me to move where?
