There are factors to consider beyond ease of contributions.

Certain information here is documenting a fundamental part of the
QEMU community operation & processes. That ought to have a high
trust level and be subject to review of content changes.  I'd say
the SubmitAPatch page falls in this category.

Other information is essentially random adhoc user written content
that isn't critical to the project. This can live with a low trust
level and little-to-no review.

IMHO, the wiki should only be considered for the latter type of
content, with any important project content being subject to
review.

I also feel like docs in git is more likely to be kept upto date
by the regular maintainers, than wikis which can become a bit of
outdated mess.

It is a shame that our normal contribution workflow doesn't make
it easy for simple docs changes to be accepted and merged :-(

It is a no-go because "Developer" role gives people commit privs to
the git repo and other related services. We can't give that perm,
even to 99% of our regular contributors, as it puts a hole in our
trust model for code changes, let alone give it to passing one-off
contributors.

I don't consider that all that much better, as even with a separate
project you're giving users permissions todo pretty much anything
with this project, on top of the wiki. 

IMHO gitlab wiki is simply unusable for any projects where the likely
contributors are 3rd parties. Its permission model is clearly designed
only for usage by a trusted development team, all directly committing
to the same repo. This doesn't work in an open source world, only for
private on-site gitlab hosting.
