Since they weren't using memory_region_allocate_system_memory(), they are
out of scope of this series.

As for the future, I'd only make boards that support user configurable
ram size to accept "-m".

For fixed size boards -m/memdev is overkill and we need to decide what to d=
o
with them. I see following options (in order of my preference):
  1. Non popular: error out if -m is specified (it used to work, but not
     anymore when check is added, i.e similar to size checks
     introduced in this series so users have to adapt their CLI).
     It can still use automatically created memdev but I'd ditch it on
     those boards and use plain memory_region_init_ram().
     This is matches well SoCs that have embedded RAM and don't really
     care about what user may specify with -m. It would simplify
     simple boards.

  2. a path of least resistance: continue support -m and generalize
     ram_size checks for such boards. This could use memdev since it
     comes for free with -m support. I don't expect complications
     with generalizing it (but one would only know for sure when
     it's coded)

The next this I plan to do is to clean up ram_size global and
hopefully get rid of MachineState:ram_size as well.
