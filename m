code changes and they look good to me implementation-wise, but I am not a
reviewer nor an expert in rst and related areas, so I am not comfortable

Peter, hi again.

While the content of this patch seems definitely unrelated to mips, we in
mips are very interested in QEMU documention framework extended and
improved, since we plan (in a mid-term) a major overhaul of both external
and internal mips-related QEMU documentation.

That is why I am closely observing activities in that area, and most
probably the missing context that left you wandering why I participate in
the discussions on these patches at all. Hopefully this explanations
removes some of your dilemmas.

Best regards,
Aleksandar
