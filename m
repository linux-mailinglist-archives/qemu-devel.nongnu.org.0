Appreciate your input, Laszlo.

I agree that in most cases tree is more efficient.  Though, I feel like
there're two issues, while the structure itself is the less important one.

Firstly, about the "tree or array" question: I'm not sure whether it's urgently
needed for kvm.  Here imho slot lookup should be the major critical operation
for kvm memslots, while crrent array impl of kvm memslot has already achieved
something similar of a tree (O(logn)) by keeping the array ordered (can refer
to search_memslots()).  That's why I think it's still ok.

The other issue is about the "atomic update" of memslots that we're trying to
look for a solution that can address all the issues we've seen.  IMHO it's a
different problem to solve.  For example, even if we start to use tree
structure, we'll still face the same issue when we want to punch a hole in an
existing memslot - we'll still need to remove the tree node before adding the
new one.  AFAICT, same failure could happen on CR3.

So IMHO the more important question is how to make these operations atomic.

To make things clearer, I'll also try to expand a bit more on the "hole" idea
proposed above.

Firstly, I believe there's also other solutions for these problems.

Assuming we would like to remove slot X (range 0-4G), and add back slots X1
(range 0-1G) and X2 (range 2G-4G), with range 1G-2G as new MMIO region.

One example is, we can introduce another new ioctl to contain a few operations
of KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, then we can put three items in:

  - Remove memslot X
  - Add memslot X1
  - Add memslot X2

So that the container update will be atomic.  I think it works too at least for
the issue that this patch wants to address.  However I think it's not ideal.
The thing is, the memslot ID could change before/after the new ioctl even if
it's backing mostly the same thing.  Meanwhile, we'll need to destroy a memslot
that is destined to be added back with just some range information changed.
E.g., if we have dirty bitmap, we need to drop it and reallocate again.  That's
a waste, imho.

So I'm thinking, how about we teach kvm similar things as what QEMU has already
know with those memory regions?  That means kvm would start to know "ok this
memslot is always that one, it never changed, however we want to mask some of
it and bounce to QEMU for whatever reason".  The simplest way to implement this
is to introduce a "hole" idea to kvm.  And as I mentioned, I believe an array
would work too similar to memslots, but that's another story.

One thing intersting about the "hole" idea is that, we don't need containers to
keep a bunch of KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION ioctls any more!  Because our
operation is naturally atomic when represented as "holes": when we add a new
MMIO region within a RAM range, we simply add a new hole element to the
existing holes of this kvm memslot (note! adding the hole does _not_ change
slot ID and everything of the slot itself; e.g. dirty bitmaps do not need to be
re-allocate when we operate on the holes).  As a summary, in the new world: A
memslot should present something more close to ramblock in QEMU.  It means
"this range will be used by the guest", but it does not mean that guest can
access all of it.  When the access reaches a hole, we bounce to QEMU as if the
memslot is missing.

(Since this is really more kvm-specific, cc kvm list too)

Thanks,
