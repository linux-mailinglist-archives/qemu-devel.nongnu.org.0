I lack context: which query command, which part of its result?

How bulky is the bitmap report?

"Optional" is a syntactic thing, which ought to be backed by a semantic
"present iff" condition.  Have we specified such conditions?

For how long has the bitmap been in the "wrong" place?  Any known
consumers?

Sounds like a valid use of feature flags to me.  However, feature flags
are best used as a last resort.  With answers to my questions, I should
be able to compare the feature flags solution to possible alternatives.
