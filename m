There is no such flag.

In the POWER secure VM model, the secure mode option isn't something
that's constructed in when the hypervisor builds the VM.  Instead the
VM is started normally and transitions itself to secure mode by
talking directly with the ultravisor (it then uses TPM shenannigans to
safely get the keys to its real storage backend(s)).

Sure, but qemu has no natural way to know if secure VM is in use,
until too late.

I am wondering if we have to introduce an "svm=3Don" flag anyway.  It's
pretty ugly, since all it would be doing is changing defaults here and
there for compatibilty with a possible future SVM transition, but
maybe it's the best we can do :/.

Hrm, ok, that's not how I've been treating it for for pseries, though
previous breakages have been for much older / rarer cases.  We broke
support for guests that don't call "ibm,client-architecture-support"
long, long ago (but such guests are really, really ancient).  We broke
support (without workarounds) for guests with 4kiB standard page size
more recently, but those are at least a decade old for common
downstream distros (you can build such kernels today, but
approximately nobody does).

Yeah, and here's where x86's visibility with mgmt because a big
thing.  Most of these changes are easily enough worked around with
machine type options - and there's no inherent reason those are harder
to work with than whole machine types, or other config details.  But
getting mgmt apps to support machine option based workarounds for us
is a real challenge.

That seems fairly reasonable to me, but it doesn't really help me move
forward right now.  Right now, we have no sane way of distinguishing
early enough between a RHEL-6 guest that needs legacy virtio and a
guest that wants to go to secure mode, and can't have legacy virtio. :(
