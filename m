Thanks for the pointer.  I've now read that review thread.

Kevin explained how the transactionable machine state snapshot command
should be made non-blocking: post-copy.

I don't dispute that creating such a post-copy snapshot is a non-trivial
task.  It is out of reach for you and me.  I didn't actually ask for it,
though.

You argue that providing a blocking snapshot in QMP is better than
nothing, and good enough for quite a few applications.  I agree!  I
blocked prior attempts at porting HMP's savevm/loadvm to QMP not because
they were blocking, but because they stuck to the HMP interface, and the
HMP interface is bonkers.  I would accept the restriction "snapshotting
machine state is blocking, i.e. it stops the machine."  As I wrote in
2016, "Limitations: No live internal machine snapshot, yet."

Aside: unless I'm mistaken, taking an internal block device snapshot is
also blocking, but unlike taking a machine state snapshot, it's fast
enough for the blocking not to matter.  That's the "sync" in
blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync.

I asked you to consider the interface design I proposed back in 2016.
You point out above that your interface is more high-level, and could be
turned into sugar for a low level interface.

If true, this means your proposal doesn't box us into a corner, which is
good.

Let me elaborate a bit on the desugaring, just to make sure we're on the
same page.  Please correct me where I'm talking nonsense.

snapshot-save creates job that snapshots a set of block devices and the
machine state.  The snapshots are consistent, i.e. they are all taken at
the same point in time.  The block device snapshots are all internal.
The machine state snapshot is saved together with one of the (internal)
block device snapshots.

This is basically a transaction of blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync
(which exists) plus machine-snapshot-internal-sync (which doesn't exist)
wrapped in a job.

Likweise for snapshot-load, except there not even the command for block
snapshots exists.

I doubt creating the (transactionable, but blocking) low-level commands
is actually out of reach.  It's a matter of adding interfaces to parts
of the code you already got working.

I'm not demanding you do that, though.  As I said, my chief concerns are
keeping "bonkers" out of QMP, and not boxing us in needlessly.
