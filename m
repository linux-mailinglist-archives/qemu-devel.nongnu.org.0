Reply-to: Cameron Esfahani <dirty@apple.com>
From: Cameron Esfahani via <qemu-devel@nongnu.org>

I added some asserts to our internal version of QEMU.  It's a few months =
off of master and, specifically, doesn't have =
fd13f23b8c95311eff74426921557eee592b0ed3.

With the previous version of hvf_inject_interrupts(), before our fix, =
the code looked like the following:

>     if (env->interrupt_injected !=3D -1) {
>         vector =3D env->interrupt_injected;
>         intr_type =3D VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR;
>     } else if (env->exception_injected !=3D -1) {


What we were seeing was, under heavy loads, running many concurrent =
macOS VMs, that we would get spurious interrupts.  Tracking it down, we =
discovered that VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR was getting injected when =
VMCS_INTR_T_HWINTR was expected.

If I take our proposed patch code, which built on top of master from a =
few days ago, and has fd13f23b8c95311eff74426921557eee592b0ed3,  and add =
an assert, like the following:

>     if (env->interrupt_injected !=3D -1) {
>         /* Type and vector are both saved in interrupt_injected. */
>         vector =3D env->interrupt_injected & VMCS_IDT_VEC_VECNUM;
>         intr_type =3D env->interrupt_injected & VMCS_IDT_VEC_TYPE;
>         if (VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR !=3D intr_type) {
>             printf("VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR (%x) !=3D intr_type (%llx)\n", =
VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR, intr_type);
>             assert(VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR =3D=3D intr_type);
>         }
>     } else if (env->exception_nr !=3D -1) {


Then we will see the assert trigger and get the following output:

> VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR (400) !=3D intr_type (0)
> Assertion failed: (VMCS_INTR_T_SWINTR =3D=3D intr_type), function =
hvf_inject_interrupts, file qemu_upstream/target/i386/hvf/x86hvf.c, line =
362.


So, as far as I can see, the proposed changes are still necessary.
