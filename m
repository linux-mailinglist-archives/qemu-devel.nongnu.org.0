I ask to make sure I understand goals and limitations of your doc string
work in this series.

Also, even a passing to Sphinx becomes more useful when accompanied by a
link to relevant documentation.

I find PEP 257 frustrating.  It leaves me with more questions than
answers.

This paragraph is already not PEP 257.

I prefer the symmetric form myself.

Okay.  Nevertheless, I'd prefer a bit more information in the commit
message.  Here's my try:

    qapi: Modify docstrings to be sphinx-compatible

    I did not say "sphinx beautiful", just "sphinx compatible". They
    will not throw errors when parsed and interpreted as ReST.  Finding
    a comprehensive style guide for our docstring utilization is left
    for another day.

    For now, use field lists recognized by Sphinx autodoc.
    FIXME link to their documentation

`lower_case` could also refer to an attribute, variable, or parameter.

Yes, :func:`start_if` is rather heavy.  I asked because I wanted to
understand what :func: buys us.  Not meant as endorsement.

GDK-Doc seems smart enough to recognize start_if().  Sphinx isn't,
because it's built around reST syntax.  We put our money on the Sphinx
horse, so...

You later reported the latter works.

I prefer `start_if()` to `start_if`.  Matter of taste.

Easy enough to tidy up :)
