If we consider a future where configure is eliminated, then I think
the answer is it should be made a built-in feature of meson.

Whether we want to remove it from configure now, in anticipation
of this future day though...

Is that just because it gets added to QEMU_CFLAGS instead of having
it own explicit config option ? If it doesn't work for some parts
of the build, then we can we just add a GPROF_CFLAGS arg and only
add it to the parts of the build where it actually works ?

Meson has built-in support for various similar concepts such as
coverage, address sanitizer, profile guided optimization and so
on. It seems like grof fits in meson in this way.

We would not need to bump our minimum depedancy if it merely
requires a meson flag to be passed - anyone who wanted to use
it would merely install newer meson to get access to the flag.
We're not using it by default, so we don't have a need to bump
the version.

Daniel
