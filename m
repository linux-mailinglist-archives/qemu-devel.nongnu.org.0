in case of 1 die, -numa is not must have as it's one numa node only.
Though having auto_enable_numa, will allow to reuse the CPU.node-id propert=
y
to compose CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX. i.e only code one path vs numa|non-numa va=
riant.

die_id is per socket numa node index, so it's not numa node id in
a sense we use it in qemu
(that's where all the confusion started that led to current code)

I understood that each die in EPYC chip is a numa node, which encodes
NUMA node ID (system wide) in CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX, that's why I
wrote earlier that EPYC makes -numa non optional.

In case of only one die we can either use auto_enable_numa to ensure
that we have consistent code or special case it and just hardcode=20
CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX value which is hackish but will let us avoid
enabling numa (explicitly or implictly).

in case of multiple dies, CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX (encodes number of nodes +
systemwide numa node id looking at CPUID of real EPYC machine)
shall match -numa mapping (otherwise it's a bug where CPUID and
ACPI mismatch).
Here we can go to ways:
  1) ask user to provide sane config with -numa (I'd prefer that)
     and use that info to fill in CPUID_Fn8000001E_ECX
  2) pretend that it's non numa machine, skip ACPI SRAT table
     but make up CPUID_Fn8000001E (i.e. another special case)
     (requires another code path and addition to -numa one)
