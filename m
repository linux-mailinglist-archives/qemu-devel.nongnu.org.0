I fully agree with Aurelien and Daniel here. As far as I know, there has 
never been a "root QEMU principle" that says that we have to restrict 
things like RAM sizes to the constraints of real hardware.

Aleksandar, where did you get the idea of that "root QEMU principle" 
from? If it's something that is written in our documentation somewhere, 
it's maybe misleading and needs to be rewritten, so please provide a 
pointer.

  Thanks,
