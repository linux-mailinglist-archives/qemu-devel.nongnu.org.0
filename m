I think patches 1-4 and 6-10 are ready to go, I also tested them now 
with my usual manual regression tests and there was no issue.

For patch 5, I first like to get some feedback from Jason, to understand 
the original intention of the removed code there.

Patch 11 needs a rework.

And for patch 12, I'd appreciate some feedback from Christian.

I'm planning to send a s390-ccw pull request for the softfreeze on 
Thursday, so if you want to see 5, 11 or 12 included there, it would be 
good to get this done within the next two days (otherwise, I think it's 
also not too critical to delay them to QEMU 5.2 instead).

  Thomas
