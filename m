Hello Kevin,

the committed patch in master is now (not sure where it changed):

diff --git a/tests/qemu-iotests/check b/tests/qemu-iotests/check
index 3ab859ac1a..e14a1f354d 100755
--- a/tests/qemu-iotests/check
+++ b/tests/qemu-iotests/check
@@ -44,7 +44,7 @@ then
         _init_error "failed to obtain source tree name from check symlink"
     fi
     source_iotests=$(cd "$source_iotests"; pwd) || _init_error "failed to enter source tree"
-    build_iotests=$PWD
+    build_iotests=$(readlink -f $(dirname "$0"))
 else
     # called from the source tree
     source_iotests=$PWD

-----

This seems to break the MacOS build (Cirrus-ci) though:

readlink: illegal option -- f
usage: readlink [-n] [file ...]
./check: line 60: /common.env: No such file or directory
check: failed to source common.env (make sure the qemu-iotests are run from tests/qemu-iotests in the build tree)
gmake: *** [/private/var/folders/3y/l0z1x3693dl_8n0qybp4dqwh0000gn/T/cirrus-ci-build/tests/Makefile.include:144: check-block] Error 1
Exit status: 2

Ciao,

Claudio
