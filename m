Not entirely. The UEFI stub uses DT to communicate with the kernel 
proper, just like a non-EFI bootloader does. There are two pieces of 
information regarding EFI that the stub passes via the device tree:
- the EFI system table address
- the EFI memory map (address, size, descriptor size etc)

(Aside: unfortunately, we cannot pass the latter information via a EFI 
configuration table, given that we call SetVirtualAddressMap() in the 
stub, which causes the config_tables member of the system table to be 
converted into a virtual address. That virtual address can only be 
converted into a physical address if we have access to the EFI memory map.)

All other information passed between the EFI stub and the kernel proper 
is passed via Linux-specific EFI configuration tables.

Yes, although the EFI stub updates/augments it with the two data items 
mentioned above, as well as the kernel command line, initrd base and 
size and a KASLR seed [if enabled].

... unless GRUB executed first and loaded a initrd, and passed this 
information via the device tree. In this case, GRUB creates an empty DT 
(Note that I posted the GRUB patches to implement LoadFile2 based initrd 
loading just a week or so ago)
