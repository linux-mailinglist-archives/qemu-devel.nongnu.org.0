Exactly :-)=20

While the reason I sometimes add/remove black lines between functions
is this, this time this was just a leftover from some stuff I removed and=
 forget
to remove the black lines. Usually prior to sending the patches I 'polish=

that=20
that well thus various issues like that poped up.
