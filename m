We've tried a number of things, and just when I thought we wouldn't be
able to make any sense out of it, I arrived at a still senseless but
precise reproducer.  TL;DR: it has to do with interactive shells and
that exact Python build.

Reproducer (docker may also do the trick here):

  $ podman run --rm -ti fedora:29 /bin/bash -c 'dnf -y install http://mirror.siena.edu/fedora/linux/releases/29/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/p/python3-3.7.0-9.fc29.x86_64.rpm; python3 -V'
  Python 3.7.0 (default, Aug 30 2018, 14:32:33) 
  [GCC 8.2.1 20180801 (Red Hat 8.2.1-2)]

With an interactive shell instead:

  $ podman run --rm -ti fedora:29 /bin/bash -i -c 'dnf -y install http://mirror.siena.edu/fedora/linux/releases/29/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/p/python3-3.7.0-9.fc29.x86_64.rpm; python3 -V'
  Python 3.7.0

How this behavior came to be, baffles me.  But, it seems to be fixed
on newer versions.

The assumption could be guaranteed by a "head -1", and while
it's not a failproof solution, it would at least not corrupt
the makefile and the whole build system.

Because I've been bitten way too many times with differences in Python
minor versions, I see a lot of value in keeping the version
information in the build system.  But, the same information can
certainly be obtained in a more resilient way.  Would you object something
like:

  python_version=$($python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version().split()[0])')

Or an even more paranoid version?  On my side, I understand the
fragility of the current approach, but I also appreciate the
information it stores.

Thanks!
