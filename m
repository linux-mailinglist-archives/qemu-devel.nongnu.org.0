For HMP we're sure, for OOB we don't know.

OOB isn't for monitor performance, it's for monitor availability.

QMP executes one command after the other.  While a command executes, the
monitor is effectively unavailable.  This can be a problem.  OOB
execution lets you execute a few special commands right away, without
waiting for prior commands to complete.

> So, I'm not sure there's a big sense in introducing some buffers.

Reading byte-wise is pretty pathetic, but it works.  I'm not sure how
much performance buffers can gain us, and whether it's worth the
necessary review effort.  How QMP reads input is not trivial, thanks to
OOB.

Have you measured the improvement?
