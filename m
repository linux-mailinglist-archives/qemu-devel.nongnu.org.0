In my case the issue with using Ubuntu 20.04 as a container host appears
to have come down to the use of the F, or "fix binary", flag by
binfmnt_misc:

# cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/qemu-aarch64
enabled
interpreter /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static
flags: OCF
offset 0
magic 7f454c460201010000000000000000000200b700
mask ffffffffffffff00fffffffffffffffffeffffff

This appears to be new in Ubuntu 20.04 relative to 18.04 and results in
the qemu-user-static binaries being loaded and locked into memory _when
the package is installed_.

Therefore, what I observed as a regression of the issue was actually
just the packaged binaries now taking precedence over patched versions
that I had built and copied into place.

Ubuntu 20.04 ships QEMU 4.2. Using the QEMU 5.1 packages from Debian
Bullseye allows SystemD to run in a foreign architecture container
without spinning in a loop:

Title:
  QEMU mishandling of SO_PEERSEC forces systemd into tight loop

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  While building Debian images for embedded ARM target systems I
  detected that QEMU seems to force newer systemd daemons into a tight
  loop.

  My setup is the following:

  Host machine: Ubuntu 18.04, amd64
  LXD container: Debian Buster, arm64, systemd 241
  QEMU: qemu-aarch64-static, 4.0.0-rc2 (custom build) and 3.1.0 (Debian 1:3=
.1+dfsg-7)

  To easily reproduce the issue I have created the following repository:
  https://github.com/lueschem/edi-qemu

  The call where systemd gets looping is the following:
  2837 getsockopt(3,1,31,274891889456,274887218756,274888927920) =3D -1 err=
no=3D34 (Numerical result out of range)

  Furthermore I also verified that the issue is not related to LXD.
  The same behavior can be reproduced using systemd-nspawn.

  This issue reported against systemd seems to be related:
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/11557
