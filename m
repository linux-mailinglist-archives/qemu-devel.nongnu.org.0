Yeah, that should work, too.

We did just that, several lines earlier, with the qemu-img info 
--backing-chain.

I actually ought to call that out in the commit message.  It used to be 
that we were inconsistent on what we could see from the backing chain (a 
filter would make it so we can't), but as soon as your filter patches 
land, then we _do_ want to always be able to find a bitmap from the 
backing chain (incremental backup depends on that: we create an overlay 
disk to run the block-copy job as a filter, and _want_ to expose that 
overlay image with the bitmap it inherits from the original image).  So 
being able to export bitmaps from a backing node is normally a feature; 
and it is only in 'qemu-img bitmap' where we don't want accidental 
inheritance to get in the way from what we are actually merging.

I'll send a v2.
