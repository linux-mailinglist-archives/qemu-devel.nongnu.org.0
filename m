Thank you for reporting this!

Believe it or not, this has been a know issue to us for a while. We
contacted the original contributor, and he says he can't recall what he
actually meant when he wrote the segment. We left it as is until he
remembers. However, this seems not likely to happen, and probably we
will issue a fix soon. In any case, it is good that you reported it,
many thanks!
