Hi all,


I have a vserver running Qemu 4.0 that seems to reproducibly hit the following assertion:

 Â bdrv_co_pwritev: Assertion `!waited || !use_local_qiov' failed.


I noticed that the padding code was recently reworked in commit 2e2ad02f2c.

In the new code I cannot find a similar assertion. Was the assertion wrong or why was it dropped?


I try to add some debugging code to find out what is exactly happing. Especially the requests that

are in flight when the assertion is triggered.


Thanks,

Peter
