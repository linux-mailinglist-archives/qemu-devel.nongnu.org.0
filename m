I think that libssh in Ubuntu 18.04 is just broken. I don't think that
we'll include a work-around in QEMU for this anymore, now that 20.04 is
already released and works fine. Thus closing this as WONTFIX.

  compiling any version of qemu like 3.1.0 4.0.0or 4.1.0 with SSH
  support,the GCC went wrong.It said some vars undeclared
  like'SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_OTHER','SSH_KNOWN_HOST_UNKNOWN',etc.
