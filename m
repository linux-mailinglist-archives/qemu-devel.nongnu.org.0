Write requests are not atomic in general.  Specific storage technologies
support atomic writes via special commands with certain restrictions but
applications using this feature aren't portable.

Portable applications either don't submit intersecting write requests or
they do not depend on atomicity.

Out of curiousity I took a quick look at Linux device-mapper.  The same
issue applies in device-mapper when intersecting write requests cross
device-mapper targets.  I think Linux submits split bios in parallel and
without serialization.
