Wasn't the decision after that discussion that we do _not_ want to
deprecate './configure; make' from the source directory?

I seem to remember that we wanted to merge a message to make a
recommendation for out-of-tree builds, but looking at configure, I can't
find even that.

So without that, and also without a mention in deprecated.rst, I don't
think having mentioned a wish to break things a while ago means that we
should just follow through with that despite the objections.

At least this isn't how it has worked for other patch series. If it is
the new standard, I can remove -drive tomorrow. I've been mentioning for
years that I don't like it and want to remove it, so people can just
deal with it.

Kevin
