Ah, thanks for looking into this and identifying it to guest code
Philippe. I don't know much about terminals, but yes, they are such
archaic interfaces, maybe there is no API for it :-(

Title:
  QEMU x86_64 -nographic full system breaks host Bash terminal line
  wrapping state after simulation ends, requires reset or "tput smam" to
  fix it

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  QEMU 4.2.0 compiled from source, Ubuntu 19.10, open a fresh new gnome
  terminal.

  If you print 1000 =3D chars on the host terminal, then they do wrap
  around the end of the terminal:

  printf "=3D%.0s" {0..1000}

  However, if you first run QEMU:

  x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic

  and then quit it in any way, e.g. with Ctrl + A, and then re-run on
  the host terminal:

  printf "=3D%.0s" {0..1000}

  then the signs don't wrap around anymore, they just go "off the
  terminal to the right".

  This can be fixed with either:

  reset
  tpam smam

  but unfortunately those don't work in tmux for some reason:
  https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/969

  I consider this buggy behavior, QEMU should restore the original
  terminal state if possible.
