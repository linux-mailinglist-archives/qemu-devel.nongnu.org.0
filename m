And it still does, because the backing file is added only after giving
the qcow2 image the right size.

But you're right, this is more accidental than by design. I wonder if
there are other problematic cases (and whether merging something like
this in -rc3 isn't rather risky).

What do we do with image formats that don't support zero clusters and
therefore can't provide PREALLOC_MODE_ZERO? Will commit just fail for
them?

This would be an incompatible image format change that needs to be
explicitly enabled by the user. This might limit its usefulness a bit.
