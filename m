Hi Jose,

Sorry I missed this mail.

Sounds good. Just keep it.

Agree.

That's will be great.

Agree.

That's the current way to implement medeleg in QEMU. I just copy the code.

In my opinion, WARL means:

1) For writable fields with WARL, any illegal written value will be 
discarded.

2) For reserved fields with WARL,  any written value will be discarded 
and it should always keep hardwired value.

I agree with your opinion. We can just use bitwise-and for medeleg.

Zhiwei
