Right.  Unfortunately the embedded cpu support is barely maintained,
so there's only a little bit of help I can give.

I don't really know if KVM even attempts to support e5500 cpus.  We'd
need to at least know what your host kernel is and what KVM variant it
is using.  What's the instruction at 0xfffffffc which seems not to be
handled here properly?  It sounds like you might be getting some sort
of rolling trap, because KVM isn't handling that instruction correctly.

The KVM_RUN is what causes KVM to actual enter the guest and execute
instructions.  It returns when something triggers a guest exit - a
trap or various other events can do this.
