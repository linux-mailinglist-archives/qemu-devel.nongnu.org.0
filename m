We could in fact add a further version of all the CPU models
which adds the "ssbd" / "virt-ssbd" and "mds" features, so
that there's a version apps can pick that covers all the
currently known hardware flaws.

Anyway, it can be done as a patch at the end of this series
or separately as desired.

Daniel
