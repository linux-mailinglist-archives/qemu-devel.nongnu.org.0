Thanks Peter, i think i see your point. However, if you ask me, i feel like advertising a feature to guest code and only implementing it on 1 platform that supports it just because it has a non-standard POSIX implementation will only confuse the issue further.
Guest code doesn't want to care whether or not an emulator is running on Linux or Windows, there is no notion of that leaking to guest code. What it cares about is being able to consistently use a certain feature in their code.
So i think it would be rather useless to implement it on Windows-only given there is a clear alternative to switch to fopen. Just my 2 cents.
