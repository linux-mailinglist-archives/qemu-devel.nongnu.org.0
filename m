Title:
  task blocked for more than X seconds - events drm_fb_helper_dirty_work

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I've had bunches of these errors on 9 different boots, between
  2019-08-21 and now, with Arch host and guest, from linux 5.1.16 to
  5.2.14 on host and guest, with QEMU 4.0.0 and 4.1.0.  spice 0.14.2,
  spice-gtk 0.37, spice-protocol 0.14.0, virt-viewer 8.0.

  I've been fighting with some other issues related to a 5.2 btrfs
  regression, a QEMU qxl regression (see bug 1843151) which I ran into
  when trying to temporarily abandon virtio-vga, and I haven't paid
  enough attention to what impact specifically this virtio_gpu issue has
  on the system In journalctl, I can see I often rebooted minutes after
  they occurred, but sometimes much later.  That must mean whenever I
  saw it happen that I rebooted the VM, or potentially it impacted
  functionality of the system.

  Please let me know if and how I can get more information for you if
  needed.

  I've replicated this on both a system with integrated ASPEED video,
  and on an AMD Vega 64 running amdgpu.

  As an example, I have one boot which reported at 122 seconds, 245,
  368, 491, 614, 737, 860, 983, 1105, 1228, then I rebooted.

  I have another that reported 122/245/368/491/614/737, went away for 10
  minutes, then started reporting again 122/245/368/491, and went away.
  Then, I rebooted about 20 hours later.

  Host system has no graphical impact when this happens, and logs
  nothing in its journalctl.

  Guest is tty mode only, with kernel argument "video=3D1280x1024".  No x
  server.
