rST format requires a blank line before the start of a bulleted
or enumerated list. Two places in qapi-schema.json were missing
this blank line.

Some places were using an indented line as a sort of single-item
bulleted list, which in the texinfo output comes out all run
onto a single line; use a real bulleted list instead.

Some places unnecessarily indented lists, which confuses rST.

guest-fstrim:minimum's documentation was indented the
right amount to share a line with @minimum, but wasn't
actually doing so.

The indent on the bulleted list in the guest-set-vcpus
Returns section meant rST misindented it.

Changes to the generated texinfo are very minor (the new
bulleted lists, and a few extra blank lines).
