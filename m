Theoretically possible, probably.  I imagine any IOMMU worth it's
silicon should be able to update ptes atomically, but there's probably
a substantial re-engineering of the internal IOMMU API and external
vfio IOMMU uAPI to get there.  For example, I don't expect we have
support at the IOMMU driver level to reshuffle ptes when an IOMMU super
page is broken.  Instead, for an unmap operation, the IOMMU API allows
the driver to return a larger number of unmapped pages than requested.
I'd be nervous about an agreed baseline for modifications to pages
covered by an IOMMU super page as well.  The vfio IOMMU type1 uAPI is
largely a reflection of this internal API with further restrictions for
tracking and accounting of user mappings.  Therefore we don't allow
mappings that modify or overlap existing mappings nor do we allow an
unmap which bisects any existing mapping.

To support a memory map approach (which implicitly negates those sorts
of rules) we'd need to know if the IOMMU driver itself can atomically
handle arbitrary maps and unmaps, performing any necessary super page
fix-ups atomically.  The internal mechanics of the vfio IOMMU would
need to change quite a bit too for tracking and pinning, I suspect.

Do we necessarily need a memory map ioctl for this or could it be the
QEMU code that compares the old and new maps to trigger map and unmap
ioctls?  For example (aiui) our race is that if we have contiguous
memory regions A and B and flatview_simplify() tries to expand A and
delete B we'll see a series of listener notifications deleting A and B
and adding A'.  But the vfio QEMU code could parse the memory map to
determine that old A + B is functionally equivalent to A' and do
nothing.  Do you foresee any breakdowns for such an approach?  Hotplug
concerns me in that a new device only has the current simplified
flatview, ex. we only know A' rather than A + B, so we can't get back
to A + !B like a device with more history could.  Thanks,

Alex
