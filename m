Hm.  Unfortunately, not all nodes in a chain always have the same
AioContext.

I think they generally should, but there is at least one exception:
bdrv_set_aio_context*() itself.  bdrv_set_aio_context_ignore() drains
the node, then puts other members of the subgraph into the same
AioContext, then itself.

Now say this reaches the bottom node.  That node will not recurse
anywhere else, but only change its own AioContext, in a drained section.
 So when that section ends, the bottom node will be in a different
AioContext than the other nodes.

So, er, well.  I have three ideas:

(1) Skip the polling on the top level drained_end if the node still has
another quiesce_counter on it.  Sounds a bit too error-prone to me.

(2) Drop the drained sections in bdrv_set_aio_context_ignore().  Instead
require the root caller to have the whole subtree drained.  That way,
drained_end will never be invoked while the subtree has different
AioContexts.

(3) I need a list after all (one that only contains AioContexts, but stil=
l).


I like (3) as little as I did in this series.  (1) seems wrong.  I=E2=80=99=
ll
try (2) first.
