Thanks for writing up this RFC.

My overall view is that there's some interesting stuff in
here and definitely some things we'll want to cover at some
point, but there's also a fair amount that is veering away
from solving the immediate problem we want to solve, and
which we should thus postpone for later (beyond making some
reasonable efforts not to design something which paints us
into a corner so it's annoyingly hard to improve later).

For instance, we don't have anything today for granularity of
definition of what tests we run where or where we disable them.
So we don't need it in order to move away from the scripting
approach I have at the moment. We can just say "the CI system
will run make and make check (and maybe in some hosts some
additional test-running commands) on these hosts" and hardcode
that into whatever yaml file the CI system's configured in.

Eventually it would be nice to allow any submaintainer
to send a merge request to the CI system (though you would
want it to have a "but don't apply until somebody else approves it"
gate as well as the automated testing part). But right now all
we need is for the one person managing merges and releases
to be able to say "here's the branch where I merged this
pullrequest, please test it". At any rate, supporting multiple
submaintainers all talking to the CI independently should be
out of scope for now.

All this stuff is not needed to start with. We cope at the
moment with "everything is gating, and if something doesn't
pass it needs to be fixed or manually removed from the setup".

We could do this, but we don't do it today, so we don't need
to think about this at all to start with.

...so we don't need to worry about somehow defining some
cut-down "build artefact" that we provide to the testing
phase. Just do a build and test run as a single thing.
We can always come back and improve later.


Have you been able to investigate and confirm that we can
get a gitlab-runner setup that works on non-x86 ? That seems
to me like an important thing we should be confident about
early before we sink too much effort into a gitlab-based
solution.

thanks
