I'm not a fan of tieing migration behaviour to machine type
versioning as they are independant concepts. It is valid to
want to use versioned machine types even if you never migrate,
in order to keep stable guest ABI to avoid license activation
checks in guest OS.

Changing --only-migratable to a "--migration-policy preferred|required|none"
is reasonable, but I think we should just have a fixed global default for
it rather than trying to second-guess intentions.

Daniel
