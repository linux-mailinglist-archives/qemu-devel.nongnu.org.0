Ah that makes sense! QEMU 1.6.0 was released in 2013 and HervÃ©'s patches to add the 
PROM MAC address support were added in 2015 so this information is outdated.

Certainly on real Magnum hardware the area of memory containing the MAC address is 
backed by NVRAM and QEMU can access it, as validated by increasing the NVRAM size.

However the current default behaviour seems correct to me, since NIC MAC addresses 
are specified on the QEMU command line and so if you make this area NVRAM you can end 
up with a mismatch between what QEMU thinks the MAC address is internally vs. the 
value in the PROM...
