It doesn't work to Linux guest either. As the following warning message
indicates, the Multicore domain isn't a subset of DIE (CLUSTER or socket)
domain. For example, Multicore domain is 0-2 while DIE domain is 0 for
CPU-0.

This case works fine to Linux guest.

Yes, I agree that it's strict to have socket-to-NUMA boundary. However,
it sounds not sensible to split CPUs in one cluster to differnet NUMA
nodes, or to split CPUs in one core to different NUMA nodes in the baremetal
environment. I think we probably need to prevent these two cases, meaning two
clusters in one socket is still allowed to be associated with different NUMA
nodes.

I fail to get accurate information about the relation among socket/cluster/core
from specs. As I can understand, the CPUs in one core are sharing L2 cache and
cores in one cluster are sharing L3 cache. thread would have its own L1 cache.
L3 cache is usually corresponding to NUMA node. I may be totally wrong here.

Thanks,
Gavin
