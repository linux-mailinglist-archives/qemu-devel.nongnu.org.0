if (ret && bs)

There are error paths before creating and opening the image, and trying
to delete bs can't succeed then.

This shadows the function-scope local_err. Worse, it isn't even
initialised to NULL here.

When you check bs above, you don't have to worry about -ENOENT any more
here.

Hm... This will end up on stderr instead of being reported as an error.
Okay because we already have an error about creating the image, which is
more important to report.

However, don't prepend bs->filename here. You already included the
filename in the file-posix driver, so you'd print the filename twice in
the same message.

This additional empty line looks unrelated.
