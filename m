Public bug reported:

When using KVM, and an OS that supports the IOAPIC, interrupts mapped on
IRQ2 (for instance, routing an HPET timer on interrupt 2) will cause the
interrupts to never be delivered. This is because QEmu, when setting up
the KVM interrupt routes, will not set one up for IRQ2[0]. When running
without KVM, IRQ2 is identity-mapped to GSI2.

My understanding is that IRQs should be identity mapped to their
equivalent GSI unless a redirection entry is present in the MADT. This
is supported by ACPI 6.2 spec[1], 5.2.12.5 Interrupt Source Override
Structure, which claims: "It is assumed that the ISA interrupts will be
identity-mapped into the first I/O APIC sources.".

I stumbled across this while working on my own custom OS, got very
confused why the HPET wasn't triggering any interruption - and even more
confused why the behavior only happened in KVM and not in non-KVM.
