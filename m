Yep.

*shrug* As opposed to the nice compiler error you get for a missing function
declaration?

That said, I think __builtin___clear_cache() may be the target-independent
runtime function that you need.  Both GCC and LLVM support this, and I'd be
surprised if that doesn't carry through to iOS.

It occurs to me that the majority of the code changes in patches 5 and 6 are
due to your choice that code_gen_buffer points to the RX copy and not the RW copy.

Swap the two, and instead have an inline function that produces the executable
pointer from the rw pointer, and suddenly there are very much fewer changes
required.

For the most part, tcg/$cpu/ generates pc-relative code, so it need not
consider the absolute address.  There are a few exceptions including,
obviously, 32-bit x86.  But the number of places that occurs is small.

There's the assignment to tb->tc.ptr of course, and
tcg_ctx.code_gen_prologue/epilogue.

In any case, each of these changes (generic, per tcg backend) can occur before
you finally add a non-zero displacement that actually separates the RX and RW
mappings.

Finally, I'd like to have this implemented on Linux as well, or I'm afraid the
feature will bit-rot.  This can be trivially done by either (1)
MREMAP_DONTUNMAP or (2) mapping from posix shared memory instead of MAP_ANON so
that you can map the same memory twice.  Thus virtually all of the ifdefs
should go away.
