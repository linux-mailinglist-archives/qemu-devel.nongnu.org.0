x86_possible_cpu_arch_ids()
   arch_id =3D x86_cpu_apic_id_from_index(x86ms, i)
   x86_topo_ids_from_apicid(arch_id, x86ms->smp_dies, ms->smp.cores,  ms->s=
mp.threads, &topo);
   // assign socket/die/core/thread from topo

so currently it uses indirect way to convert index in possible_cpus->cpus[]
to socket/die/core/thread ids.
But essentially it take '-smp' options and [0..max_cpus) number as original=
 data
converts it into intermediate apic_id and then reverse engineer it back to
topo info.

Why not use x86_topo_ids_from_idx() directly to get rid of 'props' dependen=
cy on apic_id?
