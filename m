I have a series[1] under review for the nvme device (I should have
mentioned that). There is a certain test (block/011) from blktests[2],
that disables the PCI device while doing I/O by flipping the bus master
register. QEMU correctly understands this which causes the dma_memory_rw
calls to fail while the device is not a bus master. For the NVMe device
to pass that test, it needs to know that it could not do the DMA,
otherwise it will just think that a completion queue entry was
successfully posted or data was correctly read.

The series I'm mentioning won't be going into the release, so yeah - it
can surely wait. I was just pinging to make sure someone would pick it
up at some point :)
