-cpu host can support whatever the host (hardware + KVM ) supports, but if
a user doesn't want to expose all of it to the guest, then the user doesn't
have to. For example, the host cpu may have a PMU, but the guest doesn't
necessarily get one (-cpu host,pmu=off).

It's already supported for kvm. This series just extends that support
to match tcg's sve support. The reason it's supported is that you can
then use '-cpu max' along with '-machine accel=kvm:tcg' in a command
line and it'll just work.

The guest's view of the hardware will be a single set. That set can be
different for different guests though, within the constraints of the
architecture and KVM or TCG implementations.

Exactly. That's why we need a way to explicitly state what is supported.
We can't assume anything from the max VQ alone. Additionally, while
strict truncation is required now for KVM, things may be more flexible
later. TCG is already more flexible. For TCG, all sets that at least
include all the power-of-2 lengths up to the maximum VQ are valid, as
the architecture states. Plus, all the sets that can be derived by adding
one ore more optional lengths to those sets are also valid. Listing each
of them allows management software to know what's going to work and what's
not without having to know all the rules itself.

I agree. The changes won't be small to QEMU, but hopefully we can design
a QMP query that won't need to change, saving libvirt some pain.
