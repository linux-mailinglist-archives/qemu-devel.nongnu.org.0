Passing the ZEROCOPY flag to the kernel does not guarantee
that the copy is avoided, it is merely a hint to the kernel

When getting the notification, the ee_code  field in the
notification struct will have the flag
SO_EE_CODE_ZEROCOPY_COPIED  set if the kernel could not
avoid the copy.

In this case, it is better for the application to stop
using the ZEROCOPY flag and just do normal writes, so
it avoids the overhead of the the notifications.

This is described in "Deferred copies" section of the
Documentation/networking/msg_zerocopy.rst in linux.git

So I'm suggesting that the return value of this method
be '0' if SO_EE_CODE_ZEROCOPY_COPIED was *NOT* set in
/all/ notifications, or '1' if SO_EE_CODE_ZEROCOPY_COPIED
was set in at least one notification.

Daniel
