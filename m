It was a poor heuristic because the amount of code generation space you
need really depends on the amount of code being executed and that is
more determined by workload than RAM size. You may have 4gb of RAM
running a single program with a large block cache or 128Mb of RAM but
constantly swapping code from a block store which triggers a
re-translation every time.

Also as the translation cache is mmap'ed it doesn't all have to get
used. Having spare cache isn't too wasteful.

I'd say not - we are not trying to replace/fix the original heuristic
but introduce a new one to finesse behaviour in relatively resource
constrained machines. Nothing we do can cope with all the potential
range of invocations of QEMU people might do. For that the user will
have to look at workload and tweak the tb-size control. The default was
chosen to make the "common" case of running a single guest on a users
desktop work at a reasonable performance level. You'll see we make that
distinction in the comments between system emulation and for example
linux-user where it's much more reasonable to expect multiple QEMU
invocations.
