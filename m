I don't know if other people need it, that's one of the reasons why I am=20
asking for a coarse high level feedback of the current v3 patch set before=
=20
getting into the details.

The only thing I can say right now is that I must use this feature when=20
running Samba to avoid all kinds of serious problems. And I could imagine=20
inode namespace control to become more of an issue once nested virtualizati=
on=20
becomes more popular.

Well, that would lead to the exact opposite of what you asked for. Because=
=20
allowing admins to configure an exact ID (which I think you mean should be =
used=20
as exact inode suffix by 9p then) would expose implementation details insid=
e=20
9pfs to config space, which are subject to change, might collide with=20
implementation details, and requires implementation knowledge and extreme c=
are=20
by admins so they would pick appropriate IDs with "suffix-free" property wh=
ich=20
are guaranteed to create unique numbers in all cases:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code

Also keep in mind that one fs device might end up having multiple suffixes.

Hence my suggestion was to only expose the bare minimum to config space=20
regarding this issue: Asking (if required at all) admins which ones are the=
=20
most critical pathes regarding inode namespace for their use cases, and 9p=
=20
would then automatically generate appropriate suffixes for those mentioned =
by=20
admin to achieve the highest inode namespace appropriately and in a safe wa=
y.

Plus for the "important path=3D" semantics I suggested you don't have have =
to=20
use mount points BTW. You can use subdirs and even individual files and 9pf=
s=20
would then automatically resolve the appropriate fs device of the given pat=
h.=20
So e.g. when using nested virtualization, an admin inside a lower level gue=
st=20
does not even need to know the exact mount points on a higher level / host.
