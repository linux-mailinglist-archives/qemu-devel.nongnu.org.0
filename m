Right, however I think splitting up both steps is nicer (especially if
we mix and match memmove and memset in MVCLE later). Maybe combining a
tuned-up probe_write() with something similar (but different to)
access_prepare().

General changes:

1. Check watchpoints in probe_write()

2. Make probe_write() bail out if it would cross pages() - caller has to
assure it falls into a single page (TARGET_PAGE_SIZE ?).

3. Return a pointer from probe_write()
-> If NULL is returned, reads/writes have to go via memops, e.g., single
byte access

4. Make probe_write() return addresses of TLB entries that are already
invalid again (-> LAP)


What I propose for s390x:

1. access_prepare(): Collect the pointers using probe_write() - maximum
is two pages. If we get NULL, there is no fault but we have to fallback
to read/write using memops.

2. access_memset() / access_set() / access_move() ... pass the access
information we collected. Prototype I shared can be heavily simplified -
don't fall back to paddrs but instead do single-byte access, don't allow
flexible array of pages, etc.

3. First convert MVC to the new access mechanism, later fix + convert
the others.

That's why I think introducing a new set of helpers makes sense. Once
all users of fast_memmove() etc are gone, we can then throw them away.

>=20

Yes, this should also be done in tlb_vaddr_to_host() - but as we'll be
converting to a probe_write() thingy, it might not be required to handle
the special "TLB_INVALID_MASK set after tlb_fill()" case.

Not bare writes, these are invalid. Take IPTE for example. Set the
invalid bit, then do a sync CPU flush.

If we re-translate a vaddr after probe_write() - which would currently
happen in case of LAP - then we could suddenly run into the invalid bit,
triggering a fault. The sync CPU flush still wasn't processed, but we
see the "invalid" bit early because we decided to re-translate after
already modifying memory. This re-translation really has to be avoided.

Yes, MVCL/MVCLE need a major overhaul. But good to know that a second
tlb_fill() will not result in the other TLB entry to suddenly get
invalid and require a new MMU translation (-> victim cache). That's
another concern I had.

In my example, the page would still be valid, however we the invalid bit
has already been set. The next MMU translation would choke on that and
trigger a fault.

I can only see this (re-translation) happening for LAP right now. And
LAP pages (lowcore) should be always mapped, so I don't think this is a
very important case to handle.
