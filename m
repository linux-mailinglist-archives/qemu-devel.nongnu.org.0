IIRC that's essentially what we do for all the clock stuff in QEMU.  Sometimes
we fake things a bit better by doing something like always instantly setting
the "clock has locked" bit pattern or snaping multipliers to something close to
viable, but I don't think it gets a whole lot better than that.

I'd bet a bunch of embedded software blows up when the UART suddenly becomes
very fast, whether it just exposes some bug or because the programmer knows
that's how the system behaves and the software is just taking advantage of it.
While I guess we can fix what we run in to I fell like this is going to be a
losing battle in QEMU -- I guess it's an extreme case, but imagine trying to
emulate the behavior of our DDR controller (right now we just treat all the
control registers as opaque memory, they're far from that).
