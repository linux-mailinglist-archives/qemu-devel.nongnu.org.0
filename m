The FFMpeg API for libavcodec can be found here:

  http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=libavcodec/avcodec.h

GStreamer does not really have such a low level CODEC API. So while
it's possible to use it (Wine project uses it for it's parsers as an
example, and Firefox use to have CODEC support wrapping GStreamer
CODEC), there will not be any one-to-one mapping. GStreamer is often
chosen as it's LGPL code does not carry directly any patented
implementation. It instead rely on plugins, which maybe provided as
third party, allowing to distribute your project while giving uses the
option to install potentially non-free technologies.

But overall, I can describe GStreamer API for CODEC wrapping (pipeline
less) as:

  - Push GstCaps describing the stream format
  - Push bitstream buffer on sink pad
  - When ready, buffers will be pushed through the push function 
    callback on src pad

Of course nothing prevent adding something like the vda abstraction in
qemu and make this multi-backend capable.
