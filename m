Yes the VIA southbridge chip integrates all usual PC devices including 
PICs so these may have connection internally. I haven't checked these docs 
before but now I think another chapter in the doc you referenced and its 
companion "Common Hardware Reference Platform: A System Architecture" may 
explain the unusal combination of PCI like io regs with legacy interrupts 
the Pegasos2 seems to have. In the I/O Device Reference, chapter 11 about 
IDE says that the device must be addressed only with PCI I/O addresses 
where io addresses are completely relocatable and that when OpenFirmware 
passes control to the OS IDE must be configured as a PCI device. So this 
probably means io addresses coming from PCI BARs. But the CHRP System 
Architecture, chapter 9.2 about ISA devices says that "ISA devices 
included in a PCI part must route their interrupt signals to the legacy 
interrupt controller" and this is what the Pegasos2 seems to do. This may 
be a misinterpretation of the spec because elsewhere (I've lost the exact 
reference and have no time to find it again) it also says something about 
native devices must be using OpenPIC but Pegasos2 does not have OpenPIC so 
that part surely cannot apply anyway.

I may be reading the comment wrong but to me that says that "firmware 
configures IDE in _legacy_ mode" whereas the trace shows it actually 
configures it in _native_ mode which is complying to the CHRP doc above. 
But since it cannot comply to the "native devices using OpenPIC" part it 
probably tries to apply the "ISA devices embedded in PCI" part and locks 
IRQ to 14 and 15. Or it just wants to avoid sharing IRQs as much as 
possible and the designers decided they will use IRQ14 and 15 for IDE.

Isn't this the same fixup that newer Linux kernels already include? Maybe 
this was needed before Linux properly supported Pegasos2 but later kernels 
will do this anyway. This does not give us any new info we did not have 
before I think maybe just easier to see all fixups in one place.

I think I've already done that with this patch (within the limits possible 
in QEMU). The Pegasos2 seems to always use IRQ14 and 15 even when IDE is 
set to native mode (which the firmware does immediately, I'm using a real 
firmware to test) and all guests are happy with this. This behaviour is 
confirmed by excpectations of AmigaOS and MorphOS drivers and also Linux 
comments (although those comments may get the reason wrong, they confirm 
the behaviour). I'm not sure how real hardware implements this behaviour 
and also not sure if it's a bug in the firmware or rather a peculiar 
design choice for Pegasos2. But that probably does not matter for the fact 
that it's how it works which is all we need to emulate it.

Also consider that QEMU via-ide is only emulating native mode of the chip 
because we can't switch between the two modes so it's either legacy only 
or native only because all other implemented controllers are either ISA or 
native PCI so QEMU does not have way to deregister ISA IDE and PCI code 
does not have way to use io BARs despite not being enabled via PCI config 
which could be needed to use them when device is in legacy mode. 
Previously via-ide was emulating legacy only and that worked with Linux 
but not with anything else. I'm not planning to rewrite large parts of the 
IDE and PCI code to allow switching back and forth which is not even 
needed. Unless you know a better way to implement this I think the 
proposed patch is achieving this with minimal changes. I don't see a need 
to more exactly emulate some kind of hardware bug or peculiar design 
choices of a board than what's needed to make clients happy and boot.

Is this series good enough now to be merged or are any changes needed? I'd 
like to not miss the deadline for the freeze and get this delayed for 
months for not good reason because I'm not sure when will I have time to 
work on it again.
