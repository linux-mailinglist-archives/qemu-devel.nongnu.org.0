Here's my rewording:

However, note that on a case-by-case analysis, there _are_ times where
we treat it as a feature that we can access a bitmap from a backing
layer in association with an overlay BDS.  A demonstration of this is
using NBD to expose both an overlay BDS (for constant contents) and a
bitmap (for learning which blocks are interesting) during an
incremental backup:

Base <- Active <- Temporary
           \--block job ->/

where Temporary is being fed by a backup 'sync=none' job.  When
exposing Temporary over NBD, referring to a bitmap that lives only in
Active is less effort than having to copy a bitmap into Temporary [1].
So the testsuite additions in this patch check both where bitmaps get
allocated (the qemu-img info output), and that qemu-nbd is indeed able
to access a bitmap inherited from the backing chain since it is a
different use case than 'qemu-img bitmap'.

Okay, I think I've met your request, so I'll go ahead and send the pull 
request today.
