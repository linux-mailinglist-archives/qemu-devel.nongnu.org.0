And I think this shows the problem that we realy have with the crypto
driver and amend: For every other driver, if you must, you can query the
current settings and just write them back.

The difference here is that crypto doesn't allow to directly query or
specify the content of some options (the keyslots), but provides only a
way to derives that content from a secret, and obviously there is no way
back from the stored data to the secret (that's what it's for).

I think we have two options here:

1. Add a special "don't touch this" value for keyslots. Normally, just
   leaving out the value would be suitable syntax for this. Here,
   however, we have a list of keyslots, so we can't leave anything out.

   We could use something like an alternate between str (new secret ID),
   null (erase keyslot) and empty dict (leave it alone) - the latter
   feels a bit hackish, but maybe it's not too bad. If the list is
   shorter than 8 entries, the rest is assumed to mean "leave it alone",
   too.

2. Allow to query and set the raw key, which doesn't require a password

That providing all current passwords doesn't work is obvious.

This wouldn't solve the fundamental problem that the crypto block
driver, as it currently is, isn't able to provide a blockdev-amend
callback. It's worse for qcow2 because qcow2 already implements amend.

I think we need to find a solution for the amend API.
