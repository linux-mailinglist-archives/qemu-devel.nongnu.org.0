It might be, which is why I'm asking. Now that the storage daemon has
missed 4.2, we have a little more time to decide what the command line
should look like in detail.

However, I don't think this is something that should delay the storage
daemon until after 5.0.

I really don't believe that the solution for having too much variety in
option parsing is adding in yet another type. GOptionContext is not
something I'm considering at the moment.

But it's a getopt() replacement, not something that could actually parse
the more complex options, so it's a separate question anyway. If we ever
want to use it, we can replace getopt() in all binaries at once.

If this implies that the storage daemon can only do useful things if you
specify a config file, I disagree.

I agree that it's not really nice if you can't use a config file to
specify a lengthy configuration and that supporting one would be good.

But it is at least equally unfriendly to require a config file for
simple configurations where using command line arguments is easily
possible.

Yes. This is how the storage daemon command line works, too.

I think Markus already had some patches for command line QAPIfication
that were incomplete at least for the system emulator. It might be
easier to make it feature complete for the storage daemon because it
supports much less problematic options. Maybe he can post a useful
subset (if it's too much work to clean up the full thing right now) and
we can work from there.

The one that I expect to be a bit tricky to be QAPIfied is --object.

The monitor is actually the prime example for chardev backends like
stdio or vc. I'm using them all the time and they aren't covered by
SocketAddress, so I'm afraid SocketAddress alone is not an option.

In any case, the goal of the storage daemon code is to be as boring as
possible. It should just be a thin wrapper around existing code that
glues the command line, monitor and various backends together.

So any change to the usage of chardevs (that is more than a few lines of
wrapper code) would probably have to be made in the system emulator
first, otherwise we'd end up duplicating a lot of code for the storage
daemon instead of just reusing it. I guess using SocketAddress for the
storage daemon and internall creating a chardev-socket would be possible
with a few lines if that covered stdio - but it doesn't.
