It appears to me that we can handle both use cases with a single function to
handle validation of the cross-dependent properties.

It would need to be called at the beginning of arm_cpu_realizefn, for the case
in which we are building a cpu that we wish to instantiate, and

> +        if (!err) {

here, inside qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion for the query case.

Looking at the validation code scattered across multiple functions, across 4
patches, convinces me that the code will be smaller and more readable if we
consolidate them into a single validation function.
