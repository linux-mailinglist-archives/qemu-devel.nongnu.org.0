Yes, but that doesn't mean that dram_size is necessarily smaller than ms->ram_size.

We don't have any board where this happens today but let's pretend that the Icicle
Kit board didn't have the 1.5Gb minimal RAM restriction. Its first region has
dram_size 1Gb:

[MICROCHIP_PFSOC_DRAM_LO] =         { 0x80000000,   0x40000000 },

So, if I start the board with 512M, ms->ram_size = 512M and this assert will trigger
because dram_size = 1Gb.


Thanks,


Daniel
