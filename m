Vladislav,

The OVMF debug log ends like this (with UEFI protocol GUIDs decoded as
their textual identifiers in edk2):

> [Security] 3rd party image[6D19D18] can be loaded after EndOfDxe: PciRoot=
(0x0)/Pci(0x3,0x0)/Offset(0x16400,0x4B1FF).
> InstallProtocolInterface: [EfiLoadedImageProtocol] 6D187C0

> ProtectUefiImageCommon - 0x6D187C0
>   - 0x0000000006B1F000 - 0x00000000000B6E60
> InstallProtocolInterface: [EfiDriverBindingProtocol] 6B50C00

> ASSERT /home/jenkins/workspace/edk2/rpms/build/edk2-g6ff7c838d0/MdeModule=
Pkg/Core/Dxe/Image/Image.c(1676): Image->Tpl =3D=3D gEfiCurrentTpl

This final log snippet confirms that a UEFI device driver called
"82540em.efi" is being loaded and started from the option ROM BAR of the
PCI device that is at slot 3, function 0, of the root bridge.

When this UEFI device driver is started, it trips an assert in the
platform firmware. Namely, in the CoreStartImage() function in the
"MdeModulePkg/Core/Dxe/Image/Image.c" source file of edk2:

  //
  // Image has completed.  Verify the tpl is the same
  //
  ASSERT (Image->Tpl =3D=3D gEfiCurrentTpl);

This suggests that the "82540em.efi" driver exits its entry point
function after having raised, but not having restored, the TPL (Task
Priority Level). In other words, the symptom indicates a bug in the UEFI
driver.

I *suspect* (but am not sure) that you are using an e1000 emulated NIC,
and the "82540em.efi" driver exposed in its oprom comes from the iPXE
project:

src/drivers/net/intel.c:        PCI_ROM ( 0x8086, 0x100e, "82540em",
"82540EM", 0 ),

Therefore I suspect a bug in the iPXE version that the Ubuntu 20.04
upgrade brought to you.

(I can see a number of TPL-related patches in the iPXE git history,
around Feb-Mar 2018. And QEMU loads the iPXE oprom into the emulated
NICs ROM BAR.)

Please try installing different versions of the iPXE package on your
Ubuntu host, and re-run your test (without changing any other elements
of your setup).

Thanks.

Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64 (ver 4.2) stuck at boot with OVMF bios

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  The version of QEMU (4.2.0) packaged for Ubuntu 20.04 hangs
  indefinitely at boot if an OVMF bios is used. This happens ONLY with
  qemu-system-x86_64. qemu-system-i386 works fine with the latest ia32
  OVMF bios.

  NOTE[1]: the same identical OVMF bios works fine on QEMU 2.x packaged wit=
h Ubuntu 18.04.
  NOTE[2]: reproducing the fatal bug requires *no* operating system:

     qemu-system-x86_64 -bios OVMF-pure-efi.fd

  On its window QEMU gets stuck at the very first stage:
     "Guest has not initialized the display (yet)."

  NOTE[3]: QEMU gets stuck no matter if KVM is used or not.

  NOTE[4]: By adding the `-d int` option it is possible to observe that
  QEMU is, apparently, stuck in an endless loop of interrupts. For the
  first few seconds, registers' values vary quickly, but at some point
  they reach a final value, while the interrupt counter increments:

  NOTE[5]: Just to better help the investigation of the bug, I'd like to re=
mark that the issue is NOT caused by an endless loop of triple-faults. I tr=
ied with -d cpu_reset and there is NO such loop. No triple fault whatsoever.

  NOTE[6]: The OVMF version used for the test has been downloaded from:
  https://www.kraxel.org/repos/jenkins/edk2/edk2.git-ovmf-x64-0-20200515.13=
98.g6ff7c838d0.noarch.rpm

  but the issue is the same with older OVMF versions as well.

  =

  Please take a look at it, as the bug is NOT a corner case. QEMU 4.2.0 can=
not boot with an UEFI firmware (OVMF) while virtualizing a x86_64 machine A=
T ALL.

  Thank you very much,
  Vladislav K. Valtchev
