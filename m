Title:
  configure has non-posix bash syntax

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Committed

Bug description:
  which gives an error when run on a system that uses dash for /bin/sh.

  The problem is at line 6464 which has
      if test "$have_keyring" =3D=3D "yes"
  the double equal sign is non-posix bash syntax that isn't accepted by pos=
ix shells like dash.  This was added 2020-05-25 according to git blame so l=
ooks like a recent problem.

  On an Ubuntu 20.04 system with top of tree sources I get
  gondor:2027$ ../qemu/configure --prefix=3D/home/wilson/FOSS/qemu/install-=
qemu-tmp --target-list=3Driscv64-linux-user,riscv64-softmmu,riscv32-linux-u=
ser,riscv32-softmmu
  ../qemu/configure: 6464: test: yes: unexpected operator
  ...

  configure completes OK, so this is a minor problem.  It is just one
  configure test that is failing to work properly.
