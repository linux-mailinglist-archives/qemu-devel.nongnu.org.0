Just following the s->mon_chr that is assigned in gdbserver_start(), it
looks like handle_query_rcmd() sends the HMP command to the monitor.

gdb_gen_query_table has a function pointer to handle_query_rcmd() for
the gdb protocol command "Rcmd", and I think this is what gdb will send
for the "monitor" command.

I didn't mean stop processing of gdb commands, but only of HMP commands
submitted via gdb (which will probably still block gdb while it's
waiting for a response, but only if a "monitor" command was given).

This is probably still not trivial because so far we have no buffering
involved anywhere and handle_query_rcmd() (or probably the whole gdbstub
command processing) is synchronous. Maybe run a nested event loop until
the QMP command is done or something.
