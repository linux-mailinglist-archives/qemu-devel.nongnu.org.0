Yes, that might work.

Possibly true.

is_idle is probably the wrong thing, because of the new WAIT_UNPLUG
state that happens just after setup and is designed to allow vfio
devices to be unplugged before we actually start the guts of the
migration; however the idea makes sense.

Hmm we need to find a way to stop that; lets see if Michael Tsirkin has
any ideas (cc'd) - I'm thinking if we could defer the unplug until the
end of the migration we'd be OK; but it feels racy as to whether the
destination is started with the device that the guest is unplugging.
