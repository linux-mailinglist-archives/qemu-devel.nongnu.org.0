Hah, I totally missed that too.

Seems like despite the deprecation, people just continue to use the
system sasl. I guess the extra-cflags  is reasonable for CI, and it
gives end users a warning that they're relyin on a feature of macOS
that's not considered stable....even if it doesn't appear to have
had any actual changes for 10 years.
