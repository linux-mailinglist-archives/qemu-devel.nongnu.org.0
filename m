Laurent, hi again.

I am not completely familiar with all details of Filip's work, since, as I
said, he had large degree of independance (which was intentional, and is a
desired and good thing IMHO), but taking a closer look, a question starting
lingering: Do we need special handling od read() even for RTC devices - not
only ALSA timer devices?

Best regards,
Aleksandar

&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is most likely with timespec I think.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; targets, and it gets worse with the kernel patches that ju=

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; merged for linux-5.5, which extends the behavior to deal w=
ith<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please have a look at<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, we already had the same kind of problem with SIOCGSTAMP a=

&gt;&gt;&gt; SIOCGSTAMPNS.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Do the kernel patches add new ioctl numbers to differentiate 3=

&gt;&gt;&gt; 64bit time_t?<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes, though SNDRV_TIMER_IOCTL_TREAD is worse: the ioctl argument<b=

&gt;&gt; is a pure &#39;int&#39; that decides what format you get when you =
&#39;read&#39; from the<br>
