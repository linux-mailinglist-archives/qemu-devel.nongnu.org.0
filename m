Hi,

This series is mainly a fix for
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1703793.  The problem
described there is that mirroring to a gluster volume, then switching
off the volume makes qemu crash.  There are two problems here:

(1) file-posix reopens the FD all the time because it thinks the FD it
    has is RDONLY.  It actually isn=E2=80=99t after the first reopen, we =
just
    forgot to change the internal flags.  That=E2=80=99s what patch 1 is =
for.

(2) Even then, when mirror completes, it drops its write permission on
    the FD.  This requires a reopen, which will fail if the volume is
    down.  Mirror doesn=E2=80=99t expect that.  Nobody ever expects that
    dropping permissions can fail, and rightfully so because that=E2=80=99=
s what
    I think we have generally agreed on.
    Therefore, the block layer should hide this error.  This is what the
    last two patches are for.

The penultimate patch adds two assertions: bdrv_replace_child() (for the
old BDS) and bdrv_inactivate_recurse() assume they only ever drop
assertions.  This is now substantiated by these new assertions.
It turns out that this assumption was just plain wrong.  Patches 3 to 5
make it right.


v3:
- Received no reply to my =E2=80=9CHm, warnings break 'make check', so ma=
ybe we
  should just keep quiet if loosening restrictions fails?=E2=80=9D questi=
on, so
  I assume silence means agreement.  Changed patch 7 accordingly.

- Added a test: The fact how make check kind-of-but-not-really broke
  showed a nice reproducer: Launching qemu with some file, then deleting
  that file, then quitting qemu.

- Rebase =E2=80=9Cconflict=E2=80=9D in patch 6: The forward declaration o=
f
  bdrv_get_cumulative_perm() is already in qemu thanks to commit
  481e0eeef4f.


git-backport-diff against v2:

Key:
[----] : patches are identical
[####] : number of functional differences between upstream/downstream pat=
ch
[down] : patch is downstream-only
The flags [FC] indicate (F)unctional and (C)ontextual differences, respec=
tively

       ^^^^ Again confuses my v2 patch with 8aecf1d1bd250a, should be:
