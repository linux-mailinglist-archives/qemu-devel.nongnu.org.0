Thanks Mr. Luk=C3=A1=C5=A1 and Aleksandar,
OK, now I see how important it is to have this information somewhere
on the reports page.

In response to Mr. Yongang, I said I will create an mini-report as a
guide for setting up the testbed.
I will add a section to this report with the detailed hardware
information of the used system.
Thanks for bringing this into attention.

Best regards,
Ahmed Karaman
