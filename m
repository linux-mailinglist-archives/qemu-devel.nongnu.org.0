Just a random thought: the guest should not be able to sniff, steal, or
overwrite host-side clipboard (selection) content, without the host user
explicitly requesting a clipboard operation. I understand this is
generally a problem between X11 applications (not so on Wayland, if I
understand correctly), but I assume it becomes graver with
virtualization -- there shouldn't be an unintended channel between
host/guest, or even multiple guests. (Analogy: you can "ssh -X -Y" to
two remote machines at the same time, and assuming "xauth" etc on both
of those remote machines, you can run "gedit" on each of those remote
machines, and cut'n'paste will work between them, *even if* you don't
ask for it -- that's why ssh has a separate option called "-Y".
Cut'n'paste does not work without "-Y". So I believe this is something
to consider here.)

Thanks,
Laszlo
