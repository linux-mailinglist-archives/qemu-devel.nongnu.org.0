For many reasons jack may need to be stopped and started again, such as 
hardware changes when switching to a USB audio device, or tuning the 
period size, etc. QEMU should be able to recover if the jack server goes 
away, it's that simple.

The following sequence is what triggers this fault.

   client1 = jack_client_open();
   client2 = jack_client_open();

client1 gets a shutdown signal

   jack_client_close(client1);
   client1 = jack_client_open();

client2 gets a shutdown signal

   jack_client_close(client2);
   client2 = jack_client_open();

One would expect this sequence to work fine as it conforms to the JACK 
documentation and common design practice, however, the call to 
`jack_client_open` notices that there is the 2nd session and frees it 
out from under the application.

This has been resolved in the v5 patch as suggested by Gerd by 
scheduling a QEMUBH to perform the closures so they occur in order 
before an attempt to open again. Even still this is clearly a design 
flaw in the Jack2 library.

Never tested, it's not the reason why I use jack. Suffice to say it's 
far better than PulseAudio, I get no stuttering issues like is commonly 
reported for ALSA and PA, and allows for a high degree of 
reconfigurability. The guest VM overall performs far better also as 
windows is never waiting on the audio device due to the decoupling 
provided by the ring buffer in my implementation.

Confirmed, this was investigated today.

I raised this as an issue today: 
https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues/628
The developer there seems to feel that allowing the application to know 
the jack client version is a bad thing.
