Also what is not very clear is, who is supposed/going to fix these bugs?

I see this pattern:

a) bug found by human: human keeps asking for the bug
   1/ security issue: someone assigned to fix
   2/ else: if human keeps asking, the bug gets eventually fixed.

b) bug found by fuzzer:
   1/ security issue: someone assigned to fix
   2/ else: nothing happens because unlikely hit by user

Do we want to keep tracking b.2 bug reports? I think this is the case of
the ~50 Alexander mentioned.

Regards,

Phil.
