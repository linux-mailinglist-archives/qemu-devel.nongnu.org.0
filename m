One of my build test machines is an Ubuntu 16.04 system
(specifically 16.04.6 LTS), and it has SDL2 installed
and the built test includes compiling the SDL2 UI. So I'm
not sure what's happening with your end users -- do you have
more detail on what their setup is and what isn't working for them ?

That is indeed the way our deprecation policy is supposed to
work -- we care about the versions of libraries that distros
have shipped in their LTS, not what the upstream library
release schedule is.
