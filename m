it will be futile while we continue fixing up QEMU.
practice shows there will be nothing to motivate fixing
client side for years (really, why even bother???).

Unfortunately it didn't work this time,
it was too late when integration tests caught die-id issue.
Adding random property would ensure that client won't be able
to implement only 'dummy' instead of copying all properties,
but too late detected bug issue would remain the same.

PS:
it's also me to blame not paying much attention to series and
breaking tests/cpu-plug-test, which allowed this issue to sip
through without any notice. We had test_plug_with_device_add_x86()
which would caught issue if it was run and I did break it with
commit bc1fb850a31. /me looking into fixing it/
