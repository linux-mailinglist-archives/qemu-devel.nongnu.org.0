I think just like on s390x, host is limited to KVM only.

t460s: ~/git/qemu master $ s390x-softmmu/qemu-system-s390x -cpu help |=20
grep max
s390 max             Enables all features supported by the accelerator=20
in the current host

t460s: ~/git/qemu master $ x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu help |=20
grep max
x86 max                   Enables all features supported by the=20
accelerator in the current host

x86 and s390x interpret the "all features supported" as "possible in=20
this configuration", not "supported" like in a support statement.

When not passing a "-cpu", you will automatically get the default model=20
assigned (e.g., host vs. qemu model on s390x). "max" does no mimic that!

>=20

My personal opinion: "max" really means "all features". If we want an=20
automatic way to specify something you requested ("give me something=20
that's going to work") we either have to change the definition of the=20
max model for alla rchitectures or introduce something that really=20
matches the "no -cpu specified" - e.g., "best".

--=20
