It is very much documented (just a few lines above this one), and even
if it weren't documented, that wouldn't make it an unstable ABI.

If you don't want to make it to become stable ABI, you either need to
drop it or it needs an x- prefix, and its documentation should specify
what prevents it from being a stable ABI.

How will this requirement disappear one day?
