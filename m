what about defining a migration_errors attribute, storing recent 10 error
records with format like:
    input string: error
as identical input strings always have the same error string, the 10 error
records may meet 10+ reason querying operations. And in practice, I think there
wouldn't be 10 simultaneous migration requests?

or could we just define some common errno? like 
#define ENOMIGRATION         140  /* device not supporting migration */
#define EUNATCH              49  /* software version not match */
#define EHWNM                142  /* hardware not matching*/
