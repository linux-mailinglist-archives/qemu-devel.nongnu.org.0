Hi,

As I reasoned here:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-11/msg00027.html
I=E2=80=99m no longer convinced of reverting c8bb23cbdbe.  I could see a
significant performance improvement from it on ext4 with aio=3Dnative in a
guest that does random 4k writes, and as such I feel it would be a
regression to revert it for 4.2.

To work around the XFS corruption, we still need the other three patches
from the series, of course.  We cannot restrict the workaround to just
XFS, because maybe the file is on a remote filesystem and then we don=E2=80=
=99t
know anything about the host configuration.

The performance impact should still be minimal because this just
serializes post-EOF write-zeroes and data writes, and that just doesn=E2=80=
=99t
happen very often, even with handle_alloc_space() in qcow2.


I would love to have more time to make a decision, but there simply
isn=E2=80=99t any.  Patches for 4.1.1 are to be collected on Monday, AFAIU.


v2:
- Dropped patch 1
- Forgot a =E2=80=9Ccoroutine_fn=E2=80=9D in patch 2 (it isn=E2=80=99t real=
ly important,
  qemu_coroutine_self() works in non-coroutine functions, too, but
  calling bdrv_(co_)get_self_request() from a non-coroutine just doesn=E2=
=80=99t
  make any sense)
- Patch 3:
  - Reverted the commit message to the RFC state to reflect that this is
    specifically because of handle_alloc_space()
  - Dropped the two lines that said there=E2=80=99d be no performance impac=
t at
    all because no driver would submit zero writes beyond the EOF
    (because qcow2 now still does)
