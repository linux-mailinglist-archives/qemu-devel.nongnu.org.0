This article refers to "indirect calls" and "indirect branches" quite a
few times.

I suggest mentioning "function pointers" at least once...

(AIUI, the core of the issue is that kvm.ko calls kvm-intel.ko and
kvm-amd.ko through function pointers. Such calls are the target of
malicious branch predictor mis-training, and therefore, as a
counter-measure, they are compiled into retpolines, rather than the
directly corresponding indirect call assembly instructions. But
retpolines run slowly, in comparison. Calling the functions in question
by name, in the C source code, rather than via function pointers,
eliminates the indirect call assembly instructions, and obviates the
need for retpolines. The resultant C source code is less abstract and
less dynamic at runtime, but the original indirection isn't inherently
necessary at runtime.)

I couldn't attend Andrea's presentation, nor have I seen the slides, or
a recording thereof, or the patchset; so I could easily be off. My point
is, *if* the expression "function pointers" applies in this context,
please do mention it; otherwise "indirect calls" just hangs in the air,
IMHO.

It might be as simple as replacing

  These indirect calls were not optimal before,

with

  These indirect calls -- via function pointers in the C source code --
  were not optimal before,

Thanks!
