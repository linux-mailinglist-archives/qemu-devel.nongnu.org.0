That unfortunate call sequence was the least worst compromise that the =
RISC-V design team could agree on. :-(

The actual problem was that the RISC-V instruction set has a single =
BREAK op code, without any way to parametrise it, and they refused to =
spend another op code for an extra BREAK.

Yes, I know at least two, SEGGER J-Link of OpenOCD.=20

But again, there is nothing in the silicon related to the odd call =
sequence or the ABI, everything is implemented in the debuggers. The =
silicon has only to break to the debugger, then it's up to the debugger =
to decide if this is a semihosting call or a regular break.

I don't know why you present Arm semihosting as a disaster. It is not =
perfect, but it is functional, and common unit tests use only a small =
subset of the calls.

And there is no 'window of opportunity', if the RISC-V guys will ever =
want to reinvent the wheel and come with an official 'RISC-V =
semihosting' specs, they can do it at any time, and this will have no =
impact on existing devices, everything will continue to work as before, =
only the debuggers/emulators will need to be upgraded.

But the only immediate effect such a move will have is that software =
efforts in test frameworks will be increased, to support another =
protocol, while the advantages will be minimal.

Liviu
