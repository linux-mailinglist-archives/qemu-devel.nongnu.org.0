I wish I could give you better service.  But no use pretending.

And I'm just pointing out that some of today's drawbacks could also be

Auto-cancellation on client disconnect may be exactly what's wanted for
simple use cases.

Jobs are designed with more use cases in mind.  Consider a backup job
that's take some time.  We certainly don't want to cancel it just
because the management application hiccups and disconnects.  Instead, we
want to permit the management application to recover, reconnect, find
the backup job, examine its state, and resume managing it.  To support
this, jobs have a unique ID.  Job cancellation is explicit.

Jobs could acquire a "auto-cancel on disconnect" feature if there's a
need.

I'm not sure how asynchronous commands could support reconnect and
resume.

Historical accident.  We've discussed using them for non-blocky stuff,
such as migration.  Of course, discussions are cheap, code is what
counts.

My question was specifically about "could be further improved to do
asynchronous IO writes as well".  What's the impact of not having this
improvement?  I *guess* it means that even with the asynchronous
command, the synchronous writes still block "something", but I'm not
sure what "something" may be, and how it could impact behavior.  Hence
my question.

Letting the next QMP command start before the current one is done is a
user-visible change.  We can discuss whether the change is harmless.

To gauge the difference in effort, we'd need actual code to compare.
