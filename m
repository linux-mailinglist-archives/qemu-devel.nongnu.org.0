Ability to overwrite an used slot with a different password. 
If overwrite fails, the image won't be recoverable.

The safe way is to add a new slot, then erase the old
one, but this changes the slot where the password
is stored, unless this procedure is used twice

1. Erase a slot which is already marked as
erased. Mostly harmless but pointless as well.

2. Erase last keyslot. This irreversibly destroys
any ability to read the data from the device,
unless a backup of the header and the key material is
done prior. Still can be useful when it is desired to
erase the data fast.

This is leftover, fixed now although most likely this interface will die.
I was initially planning to return
information on which slot was allocated when user left that
decision to the driver.

This is the same issue, of not beeing able to detect an union.

I was planning to have an union here where we could add
add the driver specific options if we need to have another crypto driver,
however since I discovered that union needs user to pass the driver name,
I just placed it in a struct.

So this struct is supposed to represent driver specific options, but
currently contains only luks options.

Uniting these means that I need to add some kind of 'action' to the
options, which is kind of adding a subcommand to a qmp command, which is also feels
kind of wrong.

That is why internally this is implemented as one block driver callback,
with action = {erase,update}, but qmp exposes two commands.

I would personally prefer to have that erase field,and I would have to have
it, if I switch to the amend interface.

I kind of agree with that but The reason for that is that I designed that interface like that is  to be not specific to luks.

I pass the options structure down the stack till it reaches the luks driver where it can deal with
it. If a new crypto driver is added, all you would have to do is to define new options in the json,
and use them in the new crypto driver. The rest of the code doesn't know what is in that struct.
Kind of the same as done with blockdev-create I guess.

Thanks for the review,
