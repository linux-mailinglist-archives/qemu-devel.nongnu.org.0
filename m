Hi,

When we introduced filters, we did it a bit casually.  Sure, we talked a
lot about them before, but that was mostly discussion about where
implicit filters should be added to the graph (note that we currently
only have two implicit filters, those being mirror and commit).  But in
the end, we really just designated some drivers filters (Quorum,
blkdebug, etc.) and added some specifically (throttle, COR), without
really looking through the block layer to see where issues might occur.

It turns out vast areas of the block layer just don=E2=80=99t know about =
filters
and cannot really handle them.  Many cases will work in practice, in
others, well, too bad, you cannot use some feature because some part
deep inside the block layer looks at your filters and thinks they are
format nodes.

This is one reason why this series is needed.  Over time (since v1), a
second reason has made its way in:

bs->file is not necessarily the place where a node=E2=80=99s data is stor=
ed.
qcow2 now has external data files, and currently there is no way for the
general block layer to know that the data is not stored in bs->file.
Right now, I do not think that has any real consequences (all functions
that need access to the actual data storage file should only do so as a
fallback if the driver does not provide some functionality, but qcow2
should provide it all), but it still shows that we need some way to let
the general block layer know about such data files.  (Also, I will need
this for v1 of my =E2=80=9CInquire images=E2=80=99 rotational info=E2=80=9D=
 series.)

I won=E2=80=99t go on and on about this series now, I think the patches p=
retty
much speak for themselves now.  If the cover letter gets too long,
nobody reads it anyway (see previous versions).


*** I=E2=80=99ve based this series on John=E2=80=99s bitmap branch, which=
 I=E2=80=99ve rebased
    on my block-next branch. ***

I=E2=80=99ve pushed the patches here:

  https://git.xanclic.moe/XanClic/qemu child-access-functions-v6
  https://github.com/XanClic/qemu child-access-functions-v6

I=E2=80=99ve also pushed the base branch to each of those repos, it=E2=80=
=99s
=E2=80=9Cchild-access-functions-base=E2=80=9D.


v6:
- Patch 9: Rename *freeze_backing_chain (etc.) to *freeze_chain (etc.)
- Patch 10: Drop bdrv_is_encrypted() instead of fixing it the wrong way
- Patch 15: Add a comment on why this works
- Patch 16: Just flush all children instead of one
- Patch 20: We have to snapshot all non-backing children, so both
            metadata and storage children; for simplification, just
            disallow the fallback path if there is more than one such
            child
- Patch 22: bdrv_get_allocated_file_size() should report all children=E2=80=
=99s
            sizes, not just the primary or storage child=E2=80=99s
- Patch 24: Make query-blockstats too report any filtered child under
            =E2=80=9Cbacking=E2=80=9D
- Patch 25:
  - bdrv_is_allocated_above()=E2=80=99s new @include_base parameter makes=
 things
    a bit simpler
  - Forbid mirroring to a filter on top of the base
- Patch 27: bdrv_is_allocated_above()=E2=80=99s new @include_base paramet=
er
            makes things a bit simpler
- Patch 28: Requires a few changes to keep stream independent of the
            base node
- Patch 30:
  - Sprinkle in a few bdrv_skip_implicit_filters()s
  - Conflicts with the convert --salvage patches
