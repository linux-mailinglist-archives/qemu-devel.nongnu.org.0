If I understand the problem correctly, we have two distinct axis of
configurability

 - the CPU model definitions (Nehalem, Broadwell, Skylake, host, max)
 - the accelerator CPU implementations (tcg, kvm, hvf).

At runtime any pair of objects from these two axis can be combined.

We're trying to avoid defining classes for the combinatorial expansion
of these axis.

This patch series encodes these two axis in a single class hierarchy,
with the CPU implementations being a parent of the CPU model definitions.
It avoids the combinatorial expansion, by taking the approach of dynamically
defining the parent/child relation between CPU impl and CPU defintion at
runtime  baed on the choosen accelerator impl.

The fully static way to deal with this problem is to accept that distinct
axis should be represented as distinct class hierarchies.

ie, we should have one class hierarchy for CPU model definitions, and
one class hierarchy  for accelerator CPU implementations.

So at runtime we then get two object instances - a CPU implementation
and a CPU definition. The CPU implementation object should have a
property which is a link to the desired CPU definition.

For introspection the goal is that the type tree and class tree is
identical for a *binary*, not an accelerator within a binary.
