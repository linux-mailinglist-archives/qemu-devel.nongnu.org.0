I am sorry I haven't dealt with this bug for quite a while. KDE 5 is not
properly working on my distro, and I wanted to test it when it
stabilises.

If qemu dislikes long-standing bugs, this bug can be closed, and I'll
open a new one when I have time to test it on the new KDE.

Title:
  /usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop should have an "Exec=3D" key.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  According to the www.freedesktop.org .desktop-file specification, all
  "Application" desktop files should have an "Exec=3D" key. The one in
  qemu doesn't.

  This can be easily verified by running kbuildsycoca4 if KDE4 is
  present, but the issue is not DE-dependent.

  Which binary exactly should be assigned as the default one, I don't
  know.
