I agree some guests make crazy assumptions like this.
For this specific case, we haven't witnessed this in a very wide variety=20
of guests.
Another evidence that this is pretty much safe is that this is exposed=20
by default in VMware, Xen HVM, GCP and AWS.

This list is indeed very incomplete. For example, a simple change in=20
BIOS-UUID exposed via SMBIOS also breaks activation.

No, we never expose that table to guest in Ravello.

But anyway, this is kinda of a side-discussion...
My general argument is that we prefer that a guest running with=20
machine-type X won't be exposed with new hardware/bios properties.

I think it's unnecessary, given how common WAET ACPI table is exposed by=20
default by other hypervisors.

But if you insist, I can add such flag on a separate commit in v2...
Where do you want to have such flag? It cannot be a property of some=20
qdev object.
So you want to add a new QEMU_OPTION_no_weat in vl.c?

I remember that maintainers have explicitly specified that ACPI/SMBIOS=20
should not be changed between machine-types.
This have been one of the reasons to move ACPI/SMBIOS generation from=20
SeaBIOS to QEMU control.

What can of documentation you want me to add and where?
The only thing I can say is that I tie it to machine-type because I do=20
not think a given machine-type should suddenly change BIOS exposed info=20
to guest.
But that's kinda generic. I haven't found similar documentation in other=20
ACPI-disable flags to copy from (E.g. do_not_add_smb_acpi).

> What I am asking about is whether we need a flag to disable
> this as part of the stable interface.
I personally think not. But if you think otherwise, can you provide=20
guidance of where you suggest to add this flag?
As the only place I see fit is adding a new QEMU_OPTION_no_weat.

I don't get what you wish to add. The name of the document is "Windows=20
ACPI Emulated Device Table"...
It's reasonable to expect someone which encounters this link to be=20
broken to search Google for "Windows ACPI Emulated Device Table=20
specification".

I have added on top of build_waet() the following comment in v2:

+/*
+ * Windows ACPI Emulated Devices Table
+ * (Version 1.0 - April 6, 2009)
+ *
+ * Helpful to speedup Windows guests and ignored by others.

I hope this match to what you are looking for...
