Hrm...  Keeping the warning out of QEMU might be beneficial.  Sure, when
running with new kernels the message will be redundant, but if running
with an old kernel the result will just be a silent error.

I don't have a strong opinion of the messaging, but think everything
else looks fine.  If you'd like to queue this patch with the tweaked
commit message:
