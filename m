The intention of this lock is to prevent concurrent r/w (i.e. telldir()/
readdir()) of the dir stream position by two or more active readdir requests 
handled in parallel, provided that they would use the same FID. Due to the 
latter requirement for this to become relevant, we already agreed that this is 
not something that would usually happen with a Linux 9p client, but there is 
nothing from protocol point of view that would prohibit this to be done by a 
client, so the resulting undefined behaviour should be prevented, which this 
lock does.

What's your precise concern?

Best regards,
Christian Schoenebeck
