Title:
  QEmu translation is incorrect when using REX in combination with
  LAHF/SAHF

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  When translating code that is using LAHF and SAHF in combination with the=
 REX prefix then qemu translates incorrectly.
  These two instructions only ever use the AH register. Contrary to other i=
nstructions where if you use REX + high bit offsets then it'll pull in rsp =
and a few other registers.
  On hardware the REX prefix doesn't effect behaviour of these instructions=
 at all.
  QEMU incorrectly selects RSP as the register of choice here due to this c=
ombination of REX + AH register usage.

  I've attached a patch that is super terrible just so I can work around
  the issue locally and to sort of show off how it is to be "fixed"
