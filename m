Then I guess something else must be broken. Because as reported here [1] 
if I configure two numa nodes, both with two vCPUs and set initiators of 
each node to itselfs I get the following error message:

qemu-system-x86_64: -numa 
node,nodeid=1,cpus=2-3,initiator=1,memdev=ram-node1: The initiator of 
CPU NUMA node 1 should be itself

Funny about this error message is how contradictory it is. The cmd line 
showed in the error shows the initiator of the node 1 is indeed node 1.
