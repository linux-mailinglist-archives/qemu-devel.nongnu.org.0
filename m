Hexagon port doesn't have anything to do with this patch and didn't
demonstrate anything new wrt linux-user. I have no idea what you meant to
say.

But, OK, Helge is the submitter, and he decides on the scope of his patch.
I am fine if he wants to limit it only to handful of syscalls. I just
hinted he could increase the vslue of the patch significantly in an easy
way.

Thanks,
Aleksandar
