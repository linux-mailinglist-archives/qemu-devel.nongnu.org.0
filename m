I tested it on my side. Looks to work pretty well.

one question: I noticed that when a NVDIMM slot is hotplugged one get
the following trace on guest:

nfit ACPI0012:00: found a zero length table '0' parsing nfit
pmem0: detected capacity change from 0 to 1073741824

Have you experienced the 0 length trace?

Besides when we reset the system we find the namespaces again using
"ndctl list -u" so the original bug seems to be fixed.

Did you try to mount a DAX FS. I can mount but with DAX forced off.

sudo mkdir /mnt/mem0
mkfs.xfs -f -m reflink=3D0 /dev/pmem0
sudo mount -o dax /dev/pmem0 /mnt/mem0
[ 2610.051830] XFS (pmem0): DAX enabled. Warning: EXPERIMENTAL, use at
your own risk
[ 2610.178580] XFS (pmem0): DAX unsupported by block device. Turning off
DAX.
[ 2610.180871] XFS (pmem0): Mounting V5 Filesystem
[ 2610.189797] XFS (pmem0): Ending clean mount

I fail to remember if it was the case months ago. I am not sure if it is
an issue in my guest .config or if there is something not yet supported
on aarch64? Did you try on your side?

Also if you forget to put the ",nvdimm" to the machvirt options you get,
on hotplug:
{"error": {"class": "GenericError", "desc": "nvdimm is not yet supported"=
}}
which is not correct anymore ;-)

Thanks

Eric
