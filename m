Hello,

On behalf of the QEMU Team, I'd like to announce the availability of the
first release candidate for the QEMU 4.2 release.  This release is meant
for testing purposes and should not be used in a production environment.

  http://download.qemu-project.org/qemu-4.2.0-rc0.tar.xz
  http://download.qemu-project.org/qemu-4.2.0-rc0.tar.xz.sig

A note from the maintainer:

  The rc0 is a couple of days later than scheduled because the
  planned schedule coincided with KVM Forum and I was travelling
  or on holiday for the first part of this week, and there was a
  bit of a backlog of pull requests I wanted to get in before rc0.
  rc1 should be on Tuesday next week as planned.

You can help improve the quality of the QEMU 4.2 release by testing this
release and reporting bugs on Launchpad:

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/

The release plan, as well a documented known issues for release
candidates, are available at:

  http://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/4.2

Please add entries to the ChangeLog for the 4.2 release below:

  http://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/4.2

Thank you to everyone involved!
