True.

However, the parts of QOM exposed via device_add and object-add are
definitely part of the stable external interface (unless explicitly
marked unstable).

Also true.  And terrible.

When preferences and requirements collide, preferences tend to get run
over.

The QAPI schema is *declarative*: the schema declares QAPI objects and
properties.  We generate C from the schema, which we then compile and
link into QEMU.

QOM is by design *imperative*: we execute compiled C at QEMU run-time to
define QOM objects and properties.  Maximizes flexibility.  See also
Turing tarpit.

No matter how much we'd prefer to use QAPI to specify external
interfaces to QOM, we can't without making QAPI much more dynamic or QOM
much more static.  Either is hard.  Quite possibly infeasible.

We could try to extend QAPI/QMP introspection to somehow merge in
additional information at run-time[1].  Could be regarded as a limited
way to make QAPI more dynamic.  This is in the "vague idea, not sure
it's feasible" stage.

We could try to rearchitect QOM so that you can optionally specify QOM
stuff in the QAPI schema, then require that for QOM stuff that's part of
a stable external interface.  Same "vague idea" stage, feasibility even
more doubtful.

If I remember correctly, Paolo suggested to abandon the idea to have
query-qmp-schema cover device_add as infeasible.  Instead, cover it
separately.

I think this separate introspection mechanism should be as similar to
query-qmp-schema as practical.  It should cover not just device_add, but
also object-add, and whatever other external interface to QOM we deem
stable.

Should there be more stable external interfaces that can't be defined in
the QAPI schema, we might want to cover them in this second
introspection mechanism, too.

I'd love to see a practical way forward that keeps QAPI/QMP
introspection the only game in town.

I doubt a management application should apply suggested replacements
automatically, and I doubt libvirt would.  Not even when QEMU developers
deem them "obvious".

Mostly.  Differences are due to the different consumers.

stderr is primarily for human users.  We print stuff useful to human
users.

QMP is primarily for machines, secondarily for the humans building these
machines.  We send stuff useful to the machines themselves, and stuff
the machines can use to be more useful for their users (which may be
machines or humans).  We can also send stuff to help the humans building
the machines.

In any case, the information we provide is limited by the cost to
provide it.

> Is that enough reason to provide something more complex?

We need to consider cost / benefit.

On benefit, I'd like to know what libvirt would do with the additional
information beyond logging it.

Is the additional information you propose to provide static or dynamic?

By "static", I mean each occurence of a feature in the QAPI schema is
tied to one fixed instance of "additional information".

Adds complexity.

We currently imagine QAPI features enum-like, i.e. a list of strings,
optionally with conditions.  The conditions are evaluated at QAPI
generation time, and not visible in introspection.

This is probably the stupidest solution that could possibly work.  The
structure of features is trivial.

More expressive solutions include:

* List of 'any'.  Feels like a bad idea, because it's completely
  unstructured.

* List of some 'QapiFeatures' object type.  Lets us expose the variable
  structure of features in introspection.

* List of some 'QapiFeatures' alternate type.  Like the previous, but
  permits coding simple feature flags as strings.

All of the more expressive solutions I listed treat the additional
information as dynamic.  Overly general in case the information is
actually always static.

[1] Special case of "merge additional information into QAPI/QMP
introspection at run-time, relegated to a footnote, because I think it's
of mostly historical interest now.

Qdev was designed to be declarative, but the declarations always got
collected only at run-time.  It has since been rebased onto imperative
QOM.  Since you can mix declarative qdev and imperative QOM, the
combination is effectively imperative.

We could collect the declarative parts of qdev at compile-time somehow,
and fold them into QAPI introspection.  That's the "Collect drives at
compile time" item from the slide I quoted.  I think this idea has
become pretty much worthless, since it would cover device_add only in
part, and object-add not at all.
