Thanks for the quick update! I've now tripple-checked the differences 
between the old wiki page and the new rst page, and I think with some 
additional small changes on top (which I will do while picking up your 
patch, see below), we should be fine now.

While we're at it, I'll replace the link with an internal link when picking 
up this patch (so that it can also be used in offline documentation).

You've re-introduced the broken git-bisect link. I'll fix it again.

I noticed that the --numbered will be translated into â€“numbered, so I'll add
