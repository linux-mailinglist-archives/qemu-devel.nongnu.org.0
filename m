With our current code base, you can only run a single NBD server, with=20
multiple exports, but the TLS creds are shared among all exports.  It is=20
indeed technically possible to tweak things where the single server=20
changes _which_ exports are exposed based on _which_ creds were used by=20
the client (but only when TLS is used, and note that qemu-nbd currently=20
refuses to mix TLS and Unix sockets, although I need to post a v2 of a=20
patch I proposed a while back to improve that).  But it is easier still=20
to run two separate servers on different ports with two different creds,=20
and where there is no magic on which exports to show merely based on=20
which creds were presented (and this includes a plaintext connection=20
over Unix).  Either way, it requires code changes, and most likely for 5.0.
