Maybe make this ReST from the start? Should be trivial enough.

"The virtio pmem device provides a way to support guest write

I'm not sure you should explicitly specify the machine type in this
example. I think it is fine to say that something is only supported on
a subset of machine types, but it should not make its way into an
example on how to configure a device and its backing.

Also, maybe fill in more concrete values here? Or split it into a part
specifying the syntax (where I'd use <max_size> instead of $MAX_SIZE
etc.), and a more concrete example?

"a virtio pmem PCI device" ?

Hm... what about the following instead:

"Virtio pmem devices can be hotplugged via the QEMU monitor. First, the
memory backing has to be added via 'object_add'; afterwards, the virtio
pmem device can be added via 'device_add'."

Should we be a bit more verbose on what which guest applications are
supposed to do? I.e., how do they know they need to do fsync/msync,
when should they do it, and what are the consequences if they don't?
