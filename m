Hello, Chih-Min.

Too many unclear points here.

What does this sentence mean? What is "stable"? Is that the same as
"final"? If the document is stable, why the title "draft/proposal"? Can a
"draft" be stable? Can you, or anybody else, guarantee that the final
version of this document will not affect QEMU implementation, if it is done
by the current document? If not, why would you like QEMU upstream to
support something not fully specified? Why has the final document not been
released, if the situation is stable?.....

Yours,
Aleksandar
