OK. Let's think about that for a while. I currently think you have here an
opportunity to add a really clean interface from the outset of AVR support
in QEMU (that even some established platforms don't have in full), which
is, trust me, very important for future. And it not that difficult to
implement at all. But let's both think for a while.

Best regards,
Aleksandar
