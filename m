It won't work on Intel ixgbe and Broadcom bnxt_en, which requires 
toggling the state of tap backing the virtio-net in order to 
release/reprogram MAC filter. Actually, it's very few NICs that could 
work with this - even some works by chance the behavior is undefined. 
Instead of blacklisting it makes more sense to whitelist the NIC that 
supports it - with some new sysfs attribute claiming the support 
presumably.
