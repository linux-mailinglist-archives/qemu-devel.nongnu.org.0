Ok I've been looking into this more and is_physfn is correctly set
to 0 on RoCE VFs, there is just a Bug in zPCI preventing the
is_virtfn from beeing set when the device is found in
CLP List PCI devices (equivalent too boot time bus probing
on other architectures) instead of beeing hot plugged later
which is the case for sriov_numvfs.
I'm working on a fix for a bug with PF/VF linking anyway so
should get that fixed then.
