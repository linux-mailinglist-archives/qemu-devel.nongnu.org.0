I am not familiar with nvme devices. For nic device, to my understanding,
stress nic testing will not have many IRQs, because nic driver usually
enables NAPI, which only take the first interrupt, then disable interrupt
and start polling. It will only re-enable interrupt after some packet
quota reached or the traffic quiesces for a while. But anyway, if the
test goes enough long time, the number of IRQs should also be big, not
sure why it doesn't trigger any issue. Maybe we can have some study on
the IRQ pattern for the testing and see how we can design a test case?
or see if our assumption is wrong?

In vfio_msix_vector_use(), I see vfio_disable_irqindex() will be invoked
if "vdev->nr_vectors < nr + 1" is true. Since the 'vdev' is re-inited,
so this condition should be true, and vfio_disable_irqindex() will
trigger VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS with VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE, which will
cause kernel to disable MSIX.

Sorry, I read the code again, see Qemu does write all config-space-write
to kernel in vfio_pci_write_config(). Now I am also confused about what
I was seeing previously :(. But it seems we still need to look at kernel
code to see if mismatch is possibile for config space cache between Qemu
and kernel.

FYI. Some discussion about the VFIO PCI config space saving/restoring in
live migration scenario:

thanks,
