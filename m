Title:
  arm gic: gic_acknowledge_irq doesn't clear line level for other cores
  for 1-n level-sensitive interrupts and gic_clear_pending uses
  GIC_DIST_TEST_MODEL (even on v2 where it always read 0 - "N-N")

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  For a 1-N interrupt (any SPI on the GICv2), as mandated by the TRM,
  only one CPU can acknowledge the IRQ until it becomes inactive.

  The TRM also mandates that SGIs and PPIs follow the N-N model and that
  SPIs follow the 1-N model.

  However this is not currently the case with QEMU. I have locally (no
  minimal test case) seen e.g. uart interrupts being acknowledged twice
  before having been deactivated (expected: irqId on one CPU and 1023 on
  the other instead).

  I have narrowed the issue down to the following:

  1) arm_gic_common_reset resets all irq_state[id] fields to 0. This
  means all IRQ will use the N-N model, and if s->revision !=3D
  REV_11MPCORE, then there's no way to set any interrupt to 1-N.

  If ""fixed"" locally with a hackjob, I still have the following trace:

  pl011_irq_state 534130.800 pid=3D2424 level=3D0x1

21
  pl011_irq_state 1169.500 pid=3D2424 level=3D0x0

  This is because:

  2) gic_acknowledge_irq calls gic_clear_pending which uses
  GIC_DIST_CLEAR_PENDING but this usually has no effect on level-
  sensitive interrupts.

  With this often being a no-op (ie. assuming ispendr was not written
  to), any 1-n level-sensitive interrupt is still improperly pending on
  all the other cores.

  (Also, I don't really know how the qemu thread model works, there
  might be race conditions in the acknowledgment logic if
  gic_acknowledge_irq is called by multiple threads, too.)
