Hi -- I see there have been some review comments on these patches
that mean there'll be a v4. In the meantime, patches 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10
seem to me to be independent bugfixes/cleanups that have been reviewed.
Would you like me to take those into target-arm.next to reduce the
size of the patchset for v4, or is that going to make rebasing
painful on your end?

thanks
-- PMM
