Hi Alex,

Thanks for the suggestions! I just installed docker and ran the tests,
but got the following error messages for gdbstub tests:
$ make run-tcg-tests-aarch64-linux-user
...
TEST    basic gdbstub support
warning: while parsing target description (at line 1): Target
description specified unknown architecture "aarch64"
warning: Could not load XML target description; ignoring
Truncated register 37 in remote 'g' packet
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/google/home/yuanzi/Documents/gdbstub-patch/qemu/tests/tc=
g/multiarch/gdbstub/sha1.py",
line 68, in <module>
    if gdb.parse_and_eval('$pc') =3D=3D 0:
gdb.error: No registers.
  TEST    basic gdbstub SVE support
warning: while parsing target description (at line 1): Target
description specified unknown architecture "aarch64"
warning: Could not load XML target description; ignoring
Truncated register 37 in remote 'g' packet

I'm not sure if there is any additional setup needed to make those
tests pass. Do you know how to fix those errors?

Thanks,
Lirong
