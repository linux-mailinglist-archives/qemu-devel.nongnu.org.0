The existing code does not compute hflags, at least.

There's a few possible other things, I didn't dig into qemu enough
to know if they might be a problem (e.g., reservation and TLB). I
figure it's better to keep these consistent.

Keep in mind this is a bit academic right now, because we can't
(AFAIKS) inject an MCE from TCG. It would be good to wire that up,
but I didn't get to it.

Yeah it's all pretty ugly. I didn't yet find a nice way to do
split things up that did not require a lot of code churn, but that
can come later.

Inline was just because powerpc_excp is inline, I didn't want to
change behaviour too much there (it obviously wants to do a lot of
constant propagation but maybe only on the case statement). Anyway
I just wanted to be minimal for now, it could be changed.

Thanks,
Nick
