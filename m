No objections.

I also thought about, may be, a tests/ subtree, so we'll have something like

tests/jobs/<mirror, stream, backup tests>
tests/formats/<qcow2 tests and others, or may be one more subdirectory level>
...

Yes, I've used it for same thing.

Actually, we still have the order, as I just sort iotests by name. I think,
we could add a parameter for testfinder (may be, as a separate step no in
these series), something like

--start-from TEST : parse all other arguments as usual, make sorted sequence
and than drop tests from the first one to TEST (not inclusive). This may be
used to rerun failed ./check command, starting from the middle of the process.

Hmm. I named it by class name, considering possibility to execute is just for module testing. So for module users, it's just a module with class TestFinder, and it's called testfinder.. But I don't have strict opinion in it, findtests sound more human-friendly.

OK. I'll drop img for now, documenting all the groups may be done in separate.

I added it in one-two non-obvious places. Is there any general thought about using type-hints? Should modern coder use them absolutely everywhere?
