Hi Paolo,

Having received your message in the other thread hinting, "I think
there are some issues with migration compatibility of setup_data and
they snowball a bit, so I'll reply there," and being a bit eager to get
this moving, I thought I'd preempt that discussion by trying to guess
what you have in mind and replying to it. Speculative email execution...

The SETUP_RNG_SEED parameter is used only during boot, and Linux takes
pains to zero out its content after using. If a VM is migrated or
copied, the RNG state is also migrated, just as is the case before
SETUP_RNG_SEED. For that reason, Linux also has a "vmgenid" driver,
which QEMU supports via `-device vmgenid,guid=auto`, which is an ACPI
mechanism for telling the RNG to reseed under various migration
circumstances. But this is merely complementary to SETUP_RNG_SEED, which
is intended as a very simple mechanism for passing a seed at the
earliest moment in boot, akin to DT's "rng-seed" node.

Hopefully this answers what I think you were going to ask, and sorry if
it's a total non-sequitur.

Regards,
Jason
