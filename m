The point here was that there must be some kind of absolute minimum msize, 
even though the protocol specs officially don't mandate one. And if a client 
choses a msize < P9_IOHDRSZ, what useful actions shall it be able to do? 
That's why I mentioned P9_IOHDRSZ just in case somebody might come up later 
asking to lower that minimum msize value for whatever reason.

But np, IMO this sentence makes the fundamental requirement for this patch 
more clear, but I have no problem dropping this sentence.

Rreaddir, Rread, Twrite, Rerror can be truncated. So I suggest I'll just 
change that to s/some/most/ semantically.

That's not the point for this patch. The main purpose is to avoid having to 
maintain individual error prone minimum msize checks all over the code base.
If we would allow very small msizes (much smaller than 4096), then we would 
need to add numerous error handlers all over the code base, each one checking 
for different values (depending on the specific message type).
