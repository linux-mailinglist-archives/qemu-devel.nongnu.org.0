Thanks for the explanation, which make things much clearer.

Ok. Thank you for your clarification.

Marc, sorry for the delay and didn't come to you in time because I wanted t=
o figure
out the mechanism, which helps to get similar output as x86/ppc: NMI (or re=
set exception)
is received as indication to errors, possibly panic and restart the guest k=
ernel.

The mechanism I figured out is to inject SError to guest, as below snippet =
shows. It
helps to get a panic and guest rebooting, which looks similar to what x86/p=
pc have.
I can post the patch as RFC if it's right direction to go :)

Note: I'm still investigating the code to see how SError can be injected wh=
en TCG
is used. I think we need same function when TCG is enabled, or it's somethi=
ng for
future.

static void do_inject_nmi_kvm(CPUState *cpu, Error **errp)
{
     struct kvm_vcpu_events events;
     int ret;

      :
     memset(&events, 0, sizeof(events));
     events.exception.serror_pending =3D 1;
     ret =3D kvm_vcpu_ioctl(CPU(cpu), KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS, &events);
      :
}
