We'd still have to grapple with "What about all the other time-valued
things in the QAPI schema?"

Considerung we're already at v17, I recommend to keep the first part as
focused as possible.  Since plain integer types are good enough for time
values elsewhere in our external interfaces, they'll do for HMAT
latency, too.

Once the first part is accepted, you're free to tackle the wider problem
of providing convenience syntax for time values.  Fair warning: I
consider this a swamp.
