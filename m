I now feel that, given that we've had various people say they
want to retain at least the basic in-tree build commands and are
willing to put in a wrapper to make it keep working, that this
deprecation wording is a bit strong. I don't think that it
much serves our users to say "this will go away" and then
implement the compatibility wrapper -- we've caused them
to unnecessarily change what they're doing, and then reduced
the value of the compat-wrapper work we do. A more gently
phrased note that we recommend use of out-of-tree builds
would be sufficient I think.

(That is, the idea of notes in the release notes and configure
is to signpost to our users the direction we think the
project is going in, so they are not unpleasantly surprised
in future. For this to work the signpost should be pointing
reasonably in the direction we plan to head, rather than somewhat
askew from it :-))
