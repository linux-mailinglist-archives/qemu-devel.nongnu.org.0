I was working on QMP over Xen's argo inter-vm communication for the
OpenXT project.  We had a lock up because we weren't properly dropping
QMP events in the chardev, even though we called CHR_EVENT_CLOSED.  We
fixed the argo chardev to drop messages like other chardevs, but my
investigation found QMP was still sending events even through it was
closed.

Xen's libxl opens a UNIX domain QMP socket for the duration of issuing
a command and then closes it.  OpenXT does the same over Argo.  In the
case of connecting and disconnecting, QMP events continue to be
generated after the first connection, even though there is nothing
connected for an unbounded length of time.  I was just trying to
optimize that scenario by skipping QMP events when disconnected.

Yes, I agree.

Thanks for your time looking at this.
