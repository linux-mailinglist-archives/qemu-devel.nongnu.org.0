> The fact that out-of-band qmp commands exist at all shows that we have to make tradeoffs of developer time vs. doing things right. Sure, the migration code can be rewritten to use non-blocking i/o and finegrained locks. But as a hobbyist I don't have time to fix this.

If it was just an hobbyist vs fulltime thing then I'd say that was a bad
way to make the decision; however the reality is that even those who are
paid to watch this code don't have the feeling we can make it fail
quickly/non-blocking - and for COLO you need to be absolutely sure you
nail every case, so you'd some how have to audit the whole lot, and keep
watching it.

(and thank you for taking your time to do this!)
