I happily welcome this change.  I'm going around and fixing various docs
of differnt projects that create overlays without explicitly spelling
out backing files.  (FWIW, I also make sure to mention this, in context,
in all QEMU-related talks I give publicliy.)

This proactive action from QEMU will definitely help.

Before (with: qemu-4.2.0-2.fc30):

    $> qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.raw ./overlay1.qcow2
    Formatting './overlay1.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D4294967296 backing_fi=
le=3D./base.raw cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff refcount_bits=3D1=
6

After (with the patch series applied to QEMU Git):

    $> git describe
    v4.2.0-2204-gd6c7830114

    # Create; *without* specifying "-F raw"
    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b ./base.raw ./overlay2.qcow2
    qemu-img: warning: Deprecated use of backing file without explicit back=
ing format (detected format of raw)
    Formatting './overlay2.qcow2', fmt=3Dqcow2 size=3D4294967296 backing_fi=
le=3D./base.raw backing_fmt=3Draw cluster_size=3D65536 lazy_refcounts=3Doff=
 refcount_bits=3D16

    # Rebase; *without* specifying "-F raw"
    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img rebase -b base.raw overlay1.qcow2
    qemu-img: warning: Deprecated use of backing file without explicit back=
ing format, use of this image requires potentially unsafe format probing


However, for the "Convert" case, is it correct that no warning is thrown
for the below?

    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img info overlay1.qcow2=20
    image: overlay1.qcow2
    file format: qcow2
    virtual size: 4 GiB (4294967296 bytes)
    disk size: 196 KiB
    cluster_size: 65536
    backing file: base.raw
    Format specific information:
        compat: 1.1
        lazy refcounts: false
        refcount bits: 16
        corrupt: false
   =20
   =20
    $> ~/build/qemu/qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 overlay1.qcow2 flatt=
ened.raw

    $> echo $?

Nit: s/qemu/QEMU/g/

Ultra Nit: should this paragraph be broken down into two?  Experience
tells people usually feel deterred read "substantial paragraphs" :-)

I'll report back the Amend case.  (And once I get clarification on the
Convert scenario, I'll be happy to give Tested-by.)
