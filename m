In raw_probe_alignment().

This patch explain the issues:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-08/msg00568.html

Here Kevin and me discussed ways to improve it:

Having the first block allocated changes the alignment.

Before this patch, we detect request_alignment=1, so we fallback to 4096.
Then we detect buf_align=1, so we fallback to value of request alignment.

The guest see a disk with:
logical_block_size = 512
physical_block_size = 512

But qemu uses:
request_alignment = 4096
buf_align = 4096

storage uses:
logical_block_size = 512
physical_block_size = 512

If the guest does direct I/O using 512 bytes aligment, qemu has to copy
the buffer to align them to 4096 bytes.

After this patch, qemu detects the alignment correctly, so we have:

guest
logical_block_size = 512
physical_block_size = 512

qemu
request_alignment = 512
buf_align = 512

storage:
logical_block_size = 512
physical_block_size = 512

We expect this to be more efficient because qemu does not have to emulate
anything.

Was this over a network that could explain the variance?

Maybe, this is complete install of Fedora 29 server, I'm not sure if the

Right.

The real issue is that filesystems and block devices do not expose the
alignment
requirement for direct I/O, so we need to use these hacks and assumptions.

With local XFS we use xfsctl(XFS_IOC_DIOINFO) to get request_alignment, but
this does
not help for XFS filesystem used by Gluster on the server side.

I hope that Niels is working on adding similar ioctl for Glsuter, os it can
expose the properties
of the remote filesystem.
