I've skimmed over patches, and to me it looks mostly as code movement
without apparent benefits and probably a bit more complex than what we have now
(it might be ok cost if it simplifies MADT support for other boards).

Before I do line by line review could you demonstrate what effect new way
to build MADT would have on arm/virt and i386/virt (from NEMU). So it would be
possible to estimate net benefits from new approach?
(PS: it doesn't have to be patches ready for merging, just a dirty hack
that would demonstrate adding MADT for new board using mad_sub[])
