I don't know of anyone working on supporting it.

There previously was some work towards supporting vendor CSRs in QEMU.
We are open to the idea, it just has to be done correctly.

We are happy to have support added if you would like to send patches :)

We (QEMU) would love that as well. Hopefully SiFive or someone from
the community can work towards that.
