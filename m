Fair enough. I only noticed the possibility during testing. I plugged in
a second keyboard for development to avoid locking myself out and passed
only one. Then I became confident to pass them both, but mostly because
I already had them connected. I agree it does not seem like a typical
setup...

This was the only code path that did not check !il->keycount before
calling input_linux_toggle_grab(), so I added it here as well. Maybe it
would make sense to move the condition into the function?
