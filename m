This was my first reaction too, why not use the SBSA machine as default?

We can also go all the way around to educate users to use the -M flag,
by killing the 'default machine' on all targets.

Personally I also find the default ppc64 machine confusing.

On the X86 side there is a long discussion/debt about when to change the
default i440fx to q35, so having no default at all would fix this other
issue.
