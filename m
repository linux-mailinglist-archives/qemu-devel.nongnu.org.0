The addition has a maint cost associated with it, since we have have two
different ways to achieve the same thing. When only one of the approaches
is provided by upstream, the other is not going to be widely tested. In
maintaining packages in Fedora which rely on pkg-config files that are
not upstream, we've seen frequent breakage when. So my preference is
stick with what we have that is supported by upstream gcrypt.
