Acked-by: Peter Xu <peterx@redhat.com>

IMHO it would be good to at least mention bb223055b9 in the commit
message even if not with a "Fixed:" tag.  May be amended during commit
if anyone prefers.

Also, this only applies the split limitation to s390.  Would that be a
good thing to some other archs as well?

Thanks,
