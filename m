I don't disagree it's low level.  I just disagree it's pointless.
The goal here is to provide an API that management software can
use.

If you want to hide the low level details behind a higher level
API, that's OK.  I just want to be sure we have really listened
to management software developers to confirm the API we're
providing will work for them.

This will probably require documenting the new interface in more
detail (as you have already mentioned in this thread).
