But then "recorder dump" does not fit with any "trace" concept.

There is a video at the top of https://github.com/c3d/recorder, or direct
link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DkEnQY1zFa0Y. Hope this helps.

For event categories only known through qemu trace definitions, by default,
it's the last 8 events. If you manually declare a recorder, then you can
specify any size.

(The difference between this manual recorder usage and the recorder backend
generated code is similar to the difference between the log backend and
"DPRINTF")

Yes.

- It's not recording function calls nor stack traces.
- It's faster (no fd write, no % parameter expansion)
- It works on non-Linux platforms
- It's always on

Maybe I'm unwittingly opposing some well-established qemu habits here, as
indicated by the "trace-event" command, but to me, a "trace" reports multip=
le
"events" of the same class (distinguished e.g. by their timestamps). So I
would say that I am indeed enabling a trace in order to be shown all the
events associated to this trace.

Does that make sense?

But then I understand that the existing command is called "trace-event".
So there's that. I don't mind changing the text that much.

For a given recorder instrumentation point, three things can happen:
- It is recorded in a circular buffer (always)
- If tracing is active, then a trace message is displayed
- If sharing is active, then it is copied in shared memory for use by some
  external program, e.g. recorder_scope.

Not really IMO. By configuring two trace backends, what you requested was t=
o
have two different kinds of instrumentation active at the same time. It doe=
s
not imply (at least to me) that these two kinds of instrumentation have to
react to *run-time* configuration identically, in particular if that means
in a way that happens to not be helpful.

If you configure log and ftrace, you are not requesting them to behave
identically at run time.


>
> If I configured just the recorder backend, would I get a useful trace?

Yes, but not the full functionality that "recorder" gives you.
Notably, there is nothing in the existing trace-event command that would
allow me to configure recorder sharing or trace output format, whereas the
proposed patch allows me to do that.

This would force that code to a lower common denominator that would remove =
a
lot of useful functionality specific to the recorder, even assuming we keep
both the "recorder" and "trace-event" commands to configure the recorder.

There is a problem with the semantics of the underlying API. For example,
disabling trace foo is "-foo" in qemu, "foo=3D0" in the recorder API. I don=
't
really like the idea of adding some string manipulation code to transform
"-foo" into "foo=3D0". I would prefer to extend the recorder API to accept
-foo, but that's not the case today.

Things get worse for multiple traces. In qemu, you would have
"virtio_blk_*", for the recorder it is "virtio_blk_.*" (it's a true regexp)=
.
So examples from the recorder documentation such as ".*_(error|warning)"
will not work with trace-enable, and you'd have to convert the qemu syntax
to true regexps to pass them to the recorder API, which is borderline
insanity.

I am also favorable to trying to see if a better integration would make
sense, but that would be a much more intrusive patch, with an impact on
other trace backends, e.g. add some back-end specific callback to parse the
parameter of "trace-event" to allow for more than "on|off", and possibly to
switch to true regexps or something like that for multiple traces, which
undoubtedly would break many a script.

Not easily. Long-term, with intrusive changes that affect other back-ends, =
yes.

It does, but as part of a later discussion IMO. For example, is it OK to
have backends specify some extended syntax for trace-enable? Can we somehow
accept different regexp syntax for trace-event? etc.

OK. Thanks.
