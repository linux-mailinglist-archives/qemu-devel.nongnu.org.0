"is_contained" is still expressing the environment.

What we need is a way to express features, and be able to switch beteen
autodetecting features & mandatory enablement.

eg

   if has_feature "large_file"
   then
       ...stuff using large files...
   fi

The "has_feature" helper would by default call out to
"has_feature_large_file" todo automatic probing so that things
"just work" according to whatever env the tests are run inside.

There should, however, be a flag to "./check" which force enables
the feature eg  "./check --require-feature large_file" will force
execution and not attempt to probe for it.

We could have "--require-feature :all" to force enable all optional
bits.

Any formal CI systems should use --require-feature to explicitly
force testing of features that are expected to always work.

so Travis x86 would use "--require-feature large_large", but
the arch64 version would not pass this flag and so do probing
which will auto-skip.

Daniel
