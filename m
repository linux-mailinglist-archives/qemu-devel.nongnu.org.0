From the datasheet:

  After the motor has been turned on, the matching
  data rate for the media inserted into the disk drive
  should then be programmed to the 82077AA via the
  Configuration Control Register (CCR). The 82077AA
  is designed to allow a different data rate to be pro-
  grammed arbitrarily without disrupting the integrity of
  the device. In some applications, it is required to au-
  tomatically determine the recorded data rate of the
  inserted media. One technique for doing this is to
  perform a READ ID operation at each available data
  rate until a successful status is returned in the result
  phase.

However QEMU doesn't model this delay:

static void fdctrl_result_timer(void *opaque)
{
    FDCtrl *fdctrl =3D opaque;
    FDrive *cur_drv =3D get_cur_drv(fdctrl);

    /* Pretend we are spinning.
     * This is needed for Coherent, which uses READ ID to check for
     * sector interleaving.
     */

So latest snippet could be OK.
