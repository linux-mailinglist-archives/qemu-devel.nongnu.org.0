I think this doesn't really need to exist, and is an artifact
of the later point "return values" where we commonly make methds
return void.  If we adopted a non-void return value, then these
are no longer so compelling.

Consider if we didn't have &error_fatal right now, then we would
need to

   Error *local_err =3D NULL;
   qemu_boot_set(boot_once, &local_err)
   if (*local_err)
      abort();

This is tedious, so we invented &error_abort to make our lives
better

   qemu_boot_set(boot_once, &error_abort)


If we had a "bool" return value though, we would probably have just
ended up doing:

   assert(qemu_boot_set(boot_once, NULL));

or

   if (!qemu_boot_set(boot_once, NULL))
       abort()

and would never have invented &error_fatal.

The GQuark is just a static string, and in most cases this ends up being
defined per-file, or sometimes per functional group. So essentially you
can consider it to approximately a source file in most cases. The code
is a constant of some arbitrary type that is generally considered to be
scoped within the context of the GQuark domain.

Yeah, I really dislike this verbose style...

...so I've followed this style for any code I've written in QEMU
where possible.

Even if we don't do full conversion, we can at least encourage the
simpler style - previously reviewers have told me to rewrite code
to use the more verbose style, which I resisted. So at the very
least setting the expectations for preferred style is useful.

Even if we only converted methods which are currently void, that
would be a notable benefit I think.

It is a shame we didn't just use GError from the start, but I guess
its probably too late to consider changing that now.
