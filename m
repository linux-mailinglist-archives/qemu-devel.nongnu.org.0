Note: I understand "JSON" to stand for "JSON and possibly another
concrete syntax better suited for humans".  Your examples below show
YAML in that role.

See Paolo's reply.

The single command is specified how?

Ah, "Example usage" below shows it's taken from a file argument.

Effectively ditches the CLI in favor of QMP.  One major external host
interface instead of two.

The connection to "making use of JSON the best way to deal with QEMU
both functionally and practically, for humans and machines alike" is
"make it possible to use just QMP for *everything*".  Correct?

We've toyed with the "Just QMP" idea almost since QMP exists.  We never
went beyond "wouldn't it be nice if".

The main chunk of work is providing the CLI functionality we need in
QMP.  Requires QAPIfication of the parts that aren't QAPIfied, yet.

Since parts of CLI overlap with QMP, providing CLI functionality need
not require new QMP commands.  For instance, CLI does cold plug, QMP
does hot plug.  The existing QMP interface could do both: hot while the
machine runs, else cold.

Some functionality makes sense only during initial startup.  Implied in
CLI.  In QMP, it has to be tied to the run state.  No big deal.

"Just QMP" is of course not the only way to do "JSON first".  Another
one is bringing JSON to the CLI.  I explored that: CLI QAPIfication.

Requires the same QAPIfication as "Just QMP" does.

Where "Just QMP" is a hard compatibility break by design, "JSON in CLI"
gives us a choice: we can choose to break compatibility, e.g. by
creating the exact same set of new executables you propose.  Or we can
try to evolve the existing CLI compatibly.  The latter is a tar pit,
because the existing CLI is.  But it's a tar pit *we* get to choose.  We
can't blame "JSON in CLI" for it, only ourselves.

Even though I've worked on "JSON in CLI", I'm not overly attached to it.
If we decide "Just QMP" is the better path forward, I'll happily go
along.  I believe the bulk of the work will be the same: QAPIfying
stuff.

How do the other complex executables like qemu-img, qemu-nbd fit into
this picture?

Do they become redundant somehow for non-human users?

If not, will they get a QMP-only sibling, like qemu-system-$TARGET gets
qemu-runtime-$TARGET?
