Sure, I did try to avoid breaking fuloong2e last time too and tested with 
the kernel I could dig up. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the 
right test for that machine. The fuloong2e model wasn't in very good shape 
back then. Now we have better test cases for it.

We're not there yet when I can submit pegasos2 patches for merging because 
I'll need to make more clean ups to via model and also have a replacement 
for the firmware binary that I plan to do as time permits. For OS there 
may be some older PPC Linux distros that used to work with pegasos2 and 
MorphOS demo is freely downloadable but not redistributable so maybe 
possible to use as test but I'll need some help with the python module to 
integrate it in QEMU tests. I'll keep you cc-d about this anyway as the 
MIPS maintainer.
