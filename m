It exists on OS-X, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, which covers
all the non-Linux platforms we explicitly support, aside from Windows.

On Windows /dev/random doesn't work either so we don't regress. This is
actually another argument in favour of using the newly proposed rng-builtin
by default, as that will work on Windows.

Unless I missed something, I think we'll be ok without the fallback
though I wouldn't object to having a fallback as you describe.
