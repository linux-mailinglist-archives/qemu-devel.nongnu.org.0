Yes, please!

Apparently, I've been confused by commit bab47d9a75a3 ("Sort the fw_cfg
file list", 2016-04-07) before (in January 2018):

http://mid.mail-archive.com/5367c8a4-91bd-7712-525d-0a1ed6e6acab@redhat.com

(See in particular my question which I believe remains relevant:

"is the idea that the same machine type on a new QEMU release may only
reorder the additions of the preexistent fw_cfg files across the source
code, but must not expose *new* fw_cfg files?"

And I think Gerd just answered that above (in the positive), namely,
"cross-version live migration works only for features supported by both
qemu versions". So indeed we must not have a new fw_cfg file appear in
an old machine type on a new QEMU release, without the user explicitly
asking for it on the command line.)

That's my understanding too. Thanks for explaining, Gerd!
