A bit of redundancy to guard against catastrophic accidents makes sense.
We can discuss its shape.

I figure @iter-time, too.

I tend to agree.  Expressing "zap the secret" as '"new-secret": null' is
clever and kind of cute, but "clever" and "cute" have no place next to
"irrevocably destroy data".

A boolean provides two actions.  By making it optional, we can squeeze
out a third, at the price of making the interface unintuitive: how would
you know what "@active absent" means without looking it up?

Why not have an @action of enum type instead?  Values "add" and "delete"
now (or "activate" and "deactivate", whatever makes the most sense when
writing the docs), leaving us room to later add whatever comes up.

This also lets us turn LUKSKeyslotUpdate into a union.

Brief detour before I sketch that: update safety.

Unless writing a keyslot is atomic, i.e. always either succeeds
completely, or fails without changing anything, updating a slot in place
is dangerous: you may destroy the old key without getting your new one
in place.

To safely replace an existing secret, you first write the new secret to
a free slot, and only when that succeeded, you delete the old one.

This leads to the following safe operations:

* "Activate": write a secret to a free keyslot (chosen by the system)

* "Deactivate": delete an existing secret from all keyslots containing
  it (commonly just one)

Dangerous and unwanted:

* Replace existing secret in place

Low-level operations we may or may not want to support:

* Write a secret to specific keyslot (dangerous unless it's free)

* Zap a specific keyslot (hope it contains the secret you think it does)

Now let me sketch LUKSKeyslotUpdate as union.  First without support for
the low-level operations:

    { state: 'LUKSKeyslotUpdateAction',
      'data': [ 'add', 'delete' ] }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotAdd',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                '*iter-time': 'int' } }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotDelete',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str' }
    { 'union: 'LUKSKeyslotUpdate',
      'base': { 'action': 'LUKSKeyslotUpdateAction' }
      'discriminator': 'action',
      'data': { 'add': 'LUKSKeyslotAdd' },
              { 'delete': 'LUKSKeyslotDelete' } }

Since @secret occurs in all variants, we could also put it in @base
instead.  Matter of taste.  I think this way is clearer.  Lets us easily
add a variant that doesn't want @secret later on (although moving it
from @base to variants then would be possible).

Compare:

* Activate free keyslot to hold a secret

  { "new-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

  vs.

  { "active": true, "new-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

  vs.

  { "action": "add", "secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

* Deactivate keyslots holding a secret

  { "old-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6", "new-secret": null }

  vs.

  { "active": false, "old-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

  vs.

  { "action": "delete", "secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

* Replace existing secret in-place (unsafe!)

  { "old-secret": "OSS/NKVD/MI6", "new-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6" }

  vs.

  Can't do.

Now let's add support for the low-level operations.  To "write specific
slot" to "add", we add optional LUKSKeyslotAdd member @keyslot to direct
the write to that keyslot instead of the first free one:

    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotAdd',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                '*keyslot': 'int',
                '*iter-time': 'int' } }

To add "zap specific slot" to delete, we need to pass a slot number
instead of the old secret.  We could add member @keyslot, make both
optional, and require users to specify exactly one of them:

    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotDelete',
      'data': { '*secret': 'str',       # must pass either @secret
                '*keyslot': 'int' } }   # or @keyslot

Or we use an alternate:

    { 'alternate': 'LUKSKeyslotMatch',
      'data': { 'secret': 'str',
                'keyslot': 'int' } }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotDelete',
      'data': { 'match': 'LUKSKeyslotMatch' } }

Hmm, that gets us into trouble with dotted keys, because match=3D1 could
be keyslot#1 or the (truly bad) secret "1".  Nevermind.

Or we add a separate "zap" action:

    { state: 'LUKSKeyslotUpdateAction',
      'data': [ 'add', 'delete', 'zap' ] }
    { 'struct': 'LUKSKeyslotZap',
      'data': { 'keyslot': 'int' } }
    { 'union: 'LUKSKeyslotUpdate',
      'base': { 'action': 'LUKSKeyslotUpdateAction' }
      'discriminator': 'action',
      'data': { 'add': 'LUKSKeyslotAdd' },
              { 'delete': 'LUKSKeyslotDelete' },
              { 'zap': 'LUKSKeyslotZap' } }

Compare:

* Write to keyslot#1

  { "new-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6", "keyslot": 1 }

  vs.

  { "active": true, "new-secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6", "keyslot": 1 }

  vs.

  { "action": "add", "secret": "CIA/GRU/MI6", "keyslot": 1 }

* Zap keyslot#1

  { "keyslot": 1, "new-secret": null }

  vs.

  { "active": false, "keyslot": 1 }

  vs.

  { "action": "delete", "keyslot": 1 }

  vs.

  { "action": "zap", "keyslot": 1 }
