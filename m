Public bug reported:

The "qemu-img check" function is failing on remote (HTTP-hosted) images,
beginning with Ubuntu 19.10 (qemu-utils version 1:4.0+dfsg-0ubuntu9).
With previous versions, through Ubuntu 19.04/qemu-utils version 1:3.1
+dfsg-2ubuntu3.5, the following worked:

$ /usr/bin/qemu-img check  http://10.193.37.117/cloud/eoan-server-cloudimg-=
amd64.img
No errors were found on the image.
19778/36032 =3D 54.89% allocated, 90.34% fragmented, 89.90% compressed clus=
ters
Image end offset: 514064384

The 10.193.37.117 server holds an Apache server that hosts the cloud
images on a LAN. Beginning with Ubuntu 19.10/qemu-utils 1:4.0+dfsg-
0ubuntu9, the same command never returns. (I've left it for up to an
hour with no change.) I'm able to wget the image from the same server
and installation on which qemu-img check fails. I've tried several .img
files on the server, ranging from Bionic to Eoan, with the same results
with all of them.
