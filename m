Public bug reported:

- QEMU 4.2.93 (v5.0.0-rc3) built from latest git master
20038cd7a8412feeb49c01f6ede89e36c8995472 using MSYS2 on Windows 10 and
launched on same Windows 10

- Launched using "qemu-system-i386.exe -drive format=3Draw,file=3Dhdd-
2gb.img -soundhw pcspk,sb16 -m 16 -cpu pentium -vga std -cdrom
Windows_95.iso -boot c"

- I have attached video screen capture of the issue

---

I decided to make my first ever QEMU build after encountering the dsound
issues using the latest 4.2.0 binary from https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/.
In my 5.0.0-rc3 build the sound playback is working correctly, however
the whole Windows 95 UI freezes while sound is playing.
