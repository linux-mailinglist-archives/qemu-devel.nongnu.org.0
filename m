Hi; I'm afraid that OSX 10.11 "El Capitan" isn't a supported build
platform for QEMU. Our official support policy is that we support the
two most recent versions (currently 10.14 Mojave and 10.15 Catalina);
QEMU may also run on some earlier OSX versions we don't support, but we
don't guarantee that or carry workarounds for missing functionality on
those earlier versions. In this particular case, CLOCK_MONOTONIC was
added to OSX 10.12 "Sierra".
