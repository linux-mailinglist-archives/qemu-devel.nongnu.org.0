Actually, this is even worse than I originally thought.
Even in case guest is not currently in SMM mode, if it=E2=80=99s in VMX =
non-root mode, the CR4 read here is L2 CR4. Not L1 CR4.
Therefore, CR4.VMXE doesn=E2=80=99t necessarily indicate if guest have =
nested-virtualization enabled. Same is true for MSR_EFER in case of SVM.

Putting this all together, in case kernel doesn=E2=80=99t support =
extracting nested-state, there is no decent way to know if guest is =
running nested-virtualization.
Which means that in theory we always need to fail migration in case =
kernel doesn=E2=80=99t support KVM_CAP_NESTED_STATE or =
KVM_CAP_EXCEPTION_PAYLOAD
and vCPU is exposed with VMX/SVM capability.

I can condition this behaviour with a flag that can be manipulated using =
QMP to allow user to indicate it wishes to migrate guest anyway in this =
case.
This however bring me back to the entire discussion I had with Dr. David =
Alan Gilbert on migration backwards compatibility in general and the =
fact that I believe
we should have a generic QMP command which allows to provide list of =
VMState subsections that can be ignored in migration=E2=80=A6
See: https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg622274.html

Paolo, What are your thoughts on how I would proceed with this?
