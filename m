Interesting. My interpretation of the comment was that the hardware can only operate
in legacy mode, even though the firmware configures the PCI registers to enable
native mode (which is why the class-code and IRQ routing are wrong).

I think this is the other way around? From the code above:

	if (viaide->irq != 14)
		return;

Doesn't this suggest that chrp_pci_fixup_vt8231_ata() exits without applying the fix
if it finds PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE set to 9 from the firmware above?

Do you have a copy of the full DT and the firmware revision number that was used to
generate your Linux boot output on real hardware?

I think there's still time to get something done before freeze, however I'm not
convinced that we understand the actual problem correctly (and also the use of
feature bits feels somewhat odd to me).

One more thing I don't understand: I had a glance over the logs you posted over at
https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/ticket/38949 and you mention that everything works up
to the point where BMDMA is enabled.

From memory working with cmd646 both the BMDMA and non-BMDMA interrupts end up
calling into the same *_set_irq() function in the emulated controller. So what is the
difference between the initial state where IRQs function enough to start to load an
OS, and at the point where BMDMA is enabled by the OS driver and things stop working?
How does the IRQ routing compare?


ATB,

Mark.
