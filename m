I assumed that since haven't dramatically changes in QEMU since I left,
however if I missed some recent discussions that goes again what I am
saying below, please feel free to point me to them.

I think there is a big misunderstanding here. The root QEMU principle is
to emulate each *device* or *feature* as faithfully as possible. The
*default* system that is emulated should also match as much as possible
the real hardware, but QEMU also gives users the possibility to create a
system as they want. And the amount of memory is one them.  That's
actually all the beauty of QEMU. Remember that QEMU solely exists
because it has users, and that the possibility to extend the RAM of the
Malta board to 2GB and to select various CPUs is widely used by users.

So overall there are plenty of counter examples to your "root QEMU
principles". Daniel P. Berrang=E9 mentioned the memory support on the
i440fx x86 hardware. As other examples you can also add AMD 3D Now
instructions to an Intel CPU, or add an AC97 sound device to a SH4
machine. Virtio is another example.

Adding a "virt" machine like it has been done on some other
architectures is probably a good idea to give users even more
possibilities. Now I do not believe its a reason to not allow users to
slightly extend an existing system.

In addition to that, creating a new virt machine and getting it fully
usable is a multi year project. In addition to the QEMU changes, you
also need to get kernel and bootloader support. And then it has to reach
the distributions.

QEMU doesn't have an upstream bug tracker, so I guess that regular
channels basically mean the mailing list. I therefore express the need
for a MIPS "virt" machine that supports more than 2GB. Please ping me
when it's ready.

Best regards,
Aurelien

I just responded to it, overall in less than 12 hours.
