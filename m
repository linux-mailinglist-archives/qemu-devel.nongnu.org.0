I'm definitely interested in vhost-user daemons in Rust. The one I've
been writing so far has been tried to be a minimal POSIX base without
including QEMU utility functions but I'm sure it would be nicer to start
with a clean standalone Rust library.

I think there would be scope for a vhost-user-daemon repo with multiple
reference implementations.

So has any vhost-user stuff been prototyped in Rust yet?
