Revisiting some of my notes from earlier, such as
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1454803#c46> -- apologies,
private BZ... --, we discussed some of this stuff with Mike on the phone
in April.

And, it looked like generating a hardware SMI in QEMU, in association
with the hotplug action that was being requested through the QEMU
monitor, would be the right approach.

By now I have forgotten about that discussion -- hence "revisiting my
notes"--, but luckily, it seems consistent with what I've proposed
above, under "alternatively".

Thanks,
Laszlo
