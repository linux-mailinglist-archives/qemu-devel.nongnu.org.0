Yes, I think I figured that out by patch 5.

Yes, that matches my intuition.  allocated_above says "where in the 
chain did we get the data, since it did not come from top", and the 
correct answer is "we got it from middle, due to synthesizing zero 
beyond EOF".  Okay, with that understanding in place, maybe this patch 
is right.  But I'll have to revisit it tomorrow on a fresh mind (it's 
too late in the day for me to be sure that I'm getting it all straight 
right now).

If we can come up with a reproducer where allocated_above returns 
pnum=0, that would indeed prove my initial hesitation wrong (perhaps by:

back    xxxxxxxx
mid1    xxxxxx
mid2    xxxx
mid3    xxxxxx
top     xxxxxxxx

for various different start and base points within the chain?)

I guess my real reasoning is: "I spent a lot of time trying to tweak 
that test to not lose the fact that the tail of the image reads as 
zero", because it looks weird if we later resize the image but still 
have a glitch in the middle reporting one non-zero cluster out of a 
larger range all because of the shenanigans that occurred around the 
tail prior to resizing.

Maybe it's just the comment wording that needs help.  After reading 
through patch 5, it looks like my problem is now coming up with a 
comment to the effect of "the top layer deferred to this layer, and 
because this layer is short, any zeroes that we synthesize beyond EOF 
behave as if they were allocated at this layer".

It took me a while, but I'm coming around to it: my initial read was 
assuming that you were reporting that the tail was being claimed as 
allocated by top; but in reality, you are fixing things to claim it as 
being allocated by mid.  The former is wrong (top did not allocate, it 
deferred to mid); but the latter does indeed make sense (reading from 
mid ended up synthesizing, which means that our hunt for the data ends 
at mid and we never traverse deeper, regardless of whether base may also 
have data).  But now it's a question of whether the code matches that 
textual description, and I'm a bit too fried to answer that question 
properly today :)

So, if we can avoid that minor regression, and still otherwise report 
zeroes as allocated from mid, then I think we'll be on the right track.
