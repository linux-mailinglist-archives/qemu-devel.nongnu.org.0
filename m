Of course, I did not mean that we'll ever support 600+ AVR SoCs/MCUs, or 53
AVR watchogs, but, as the work in Pavel's repository illustrates, we will
stumble very soon on, let's say different USART devices (in this case
between "atmega2560" and one of "xmega" cores. It is realistic that we can
potentially end up needing support for 5-6 AVR USARTs. How to name them, as
a first question?

Not to mention also possible dependencies between various devices,
interleaved memory ranges, shared registers...
