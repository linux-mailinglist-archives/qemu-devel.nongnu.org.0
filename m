I was able to boot a VM with just the functions of the device with the
ethernet controller function ID added as PCI devices. Something I
noticed while adding in those devices though is that all of the others
have a description associated with them in Proxmox, but the one that's
causing the boot to fail doesn't. I attached a picture of the menu,
81:00.7 has no functions associated with it. So it seems like it just
doesn't have any function at all? Unless it benefits QEMU to know
whether turning SR-IOV on for these cards fixes the problem, I don't
think I'm going to go through the process of turning  it on, since the
process looks terrible. Thank you for your help.

Title:
  Chelsio T4 has old MSIX PBA offset bug

Status in QEMU:
  New
Status in Debian:
  In Progress

Bug description:
  There exists a bug with Chelsio NICs T4 that causes the following
  error:

  kvm: -device vfio-
  pci,host=3D0000:83:00.7,id=3Dhostpci1.7,bus=3Dpci.0,addr=3D0x11.7: vfio
  0000:83:00.7: hardware reports invalid configuration, MSIX PBA outside
  of specified BAR

  I discovered this bug on a Proxmox system, and I was working with a
  downstream Proxmox developer to try to fix this issue. They provided
  me with the following change to make from line 1484 of hw/vfio/pci.c:

  static void vfio_msix_early_setup(VFIOPCIDevice *vdev, Error **errp)
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0* is 0x1000, =
so we hard code that here.
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0*/
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0if (vdev->vendor_id=
 =3D=3D PCI_VENDOR_ID_CHELSIO &&
  -            (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x5800) {
  +            ((vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x5800 ||
  +             (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x1425)) {
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0msix->pba_offset =3D 0x1000;
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0} else if (vdev->ms=
ix_relo =3D=3D OFF_AUTOPCIBAR_OFF) {
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=
=C2=A0error_setg(errp, "hardware reports invalid configuration, "

  However, I found that this did not fix the issue, so the bug appears
  to work differently than the one that was present on the T5 NICs which
  has already been patched. I have attached the output of my lspci
  -nnkvv
