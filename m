Hm, I don't know these interfaces very well, but from you explanation it
looks to me as if having a bitmap name made sense with
x-nbd-server-add-bitmap because it could be called more than once for
exporting multiple bitmaps.

But now, we have only nbd-server-add, which takes a single bitmap name.
As we don't have to distinguish multiple bitmaps any more, wouldn't it
make more sense to use "qemu:dirty-bitmap" without any other
information? Both export name and bitmap name are already identified by
the connection.

But if we have to have something there, using the bitmap name (which may
or may not be the same as used in the image file) makes a little more
sense because it makes the interface extensible for the case that we
ever want to re-introduce an nbd-server-add-bitmap.

(By the way, even if the patch were correct, it lacks a Signed-off-by.)
