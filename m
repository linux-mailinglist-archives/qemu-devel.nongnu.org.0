The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  Overwrite argv to set process title, eliminating 16-character prctl()
  limit.

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I've modified qemu to overwrite its arguments to set the process
  title, since its current prctl() method has a 16-character limit.

  I posted the original patch to qemu-devel, made the changes others
  suggested, then re-posted to qemu-devel. I flailed around a bit with
  the patch submission process and think I finally got it right, but
  haven't been able to gain the notice of a committer to have this
  pushed. Maybe this will get more attention when reported in the BTS.
