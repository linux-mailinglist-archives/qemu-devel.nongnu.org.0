in blockdev_backup_prepare, we check to make sure that the target is
associated with a compatible aio context. However, do_blockdev_backup is
called later and has some logic to move the target to a compatible
aio_context. The transaction version will fail certain commands
needlessly early as a result.

Allow blockdev_backup_prepare to simply call do_blockdev_backup, which
will ultimately decide if the contexts are compatible or not.

Note: the transaction version has always disallowed this operation since
its initial commit bd8baecd (2014), whereas the version of
qmp_blockdev_backup at the time, from commit c29c1dd312f, tried to
enforce the aio_context switch instead. It's not clear, and I can't see
from the mailing list archives at the time, why the two functions take a
different approach. It wasn't until later in efd7556708b (2016) that the
standalone version tried to determine if it could set the context or
not.
