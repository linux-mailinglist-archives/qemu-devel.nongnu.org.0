Thanks, Alex.

I am still thinking, looking at broader picture, maybe that ratio, if
applied on appropriate set of diverse workloads and averaged, could be the
considered something like "efficiency of QEMU" - and that measure could
possibly be used when making some TCG changes, aimed to achieve better
performance.

Interesting!

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi Mr. Alex,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve created a plugins build as you&#39;ve said using &qu=
ot;--enable-plugins&quot;<br>
&gt;&gt; option.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve searched for &quot;libinsn.so&quot; plugin that you&=
#39;ve mentioned in your<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; command but it isn&#39;t in that path.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; make plugins<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; and you should find them in tests/plugins/<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi, both Alex and Ahmed,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ahmed showed me tonight the first results with number of guest<br>
&gt; instructions. It was almost eye-opening to me. The thing is, by now, I=
 had<br>
&gt; only vague picture that, on average, &quot;many&quot; host instruction=
s are generated<br>
&gt; per one guest instruction. Now, I could see exact ratio for each targe=
t,<br>
&gt; for a particular example.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A question for Alex:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - What would be the application of this new info? (Except that one has=
 nice<br>
&gt; feeling, like I do, of knowing the exact ratio host/guest instruction =
for a<br>
&gt; particular scenario.)<br>
<br>

<br>
