I didn't thought about it. This is a very good point!

Fully agree, and thanks for these examples!

I guess we should anyway use amend interface, while updating its definition
a bit to suit the broader requirements of the drivers, e.g luks.

I see the amend interface being like generic 'edit the device options' thin=
g,
which is maybe better that adding device specific commands like add-key,rem=
ove-key,
etc. No strong opinion on this though.
