I'm not sure I follow the complaint.  If a cluster is preallocated but 
the subcluster is marked unallocated, then doing a partial write to that 
subcluster must provide the correct contents for the rest of the 
subcluster (either filling with zero, or reading from a backing file) - 
but this COW can be limited to just the portion of the subcluster, and 
is no different than the COW you have to perform without subclusters 
when doing a write to a preallocated cluster in general.

Without a backing file, there is no read required - writing to an 
unallocated subcluster within a preallocated cluster merely has to 
provide zeros to the rest of the write.  And depending on whether we can 
intelligently guarantee that the underlying protocol already reads as 
zeroes when preallocated, we even have an optimization where even that 
is not necessary.  We can still lump it in the "COW" terminology, in 
that our write is more complex than merely writing in place, but it 
isn't a true copy-on-write operation as there is nothing to be copied.
