I'm not sure how KVM works for this case so I also don't know why and what 
would need to be modified. I think we'll only have KVM PR working as newer 
POWER CPUs having HV (besides being rare among potential users) are 
probably too different to run the OSes that expect at most a G4 on 
pegasos2 so likely it won't work with KVM HV. If we have KVM PR doesn't sc 
already trap so we could add MOL OSI without further modification to KVM 
itself only needing change in QEMU? I also hope that MOL OSI could be 
useful for porting some paravirt drivers from MOL for running Mac OS X on 
Mac emulation but I don't know about that for sure so I'm open to any 
other solution too. For now I'm going with vhyp which is enough fot 
testing with TCG and if somebody wants KVM they could use he original 
firmware for now so this could be improved in a later version unless a 
simple solution is found before the freeze for 6.1. If we're in KVM PR 
what happens for sc 1 could that be used too so maybe what we have now 
could work?

I think I've tried that but what worked to access mmio device registers 
are stl_le_phys and similar that are wrappers around address_space_stl_*. 
But I did not mean that for rtas_ld/_st but the part when vof accessing 
the parameters passed by its hypercall which is memory access:

https://github.com/patchew-project/qemu/blob/patchew/20210520090557.435689-1-aik%40ozlabs.ru/hw/ppc/vof.c

line 893, and vof_client_call before that is very similar to what h_rtas 
does here:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=hw/ppc/spapr_hcall.c;h=f25014afda408002ee1ec1027a0dd7a6025eca61;hb=HEAD#l639

and I also need to do the same for rtas in pegasos2 for which I'm just 
using ldl_be_phys for now but I wonder if we really need 3 ways to do the 
same or the rtas_ld/_st could be made more generic and reused here?
