One thing I would like to discuss here.

Firstly, I'm not quite sure how the picture of non-public CSR looks like.
Is it suggested that non-standard CSR number shall not be exposed ?

I know that we should focus on custom CSR part, yet I need to make sure
that if following logic is permitted to appear in `target/riscv/trans_insn` :

trans_vendor_A_insn_blah(...) {
    riscv_csrrw(env, CSR_VENDOR_A_CUSTOM, r, n, write_mask);
    }

As far as I know, csr number is not presented as a C++ enum, which we
can access via csr::custom::vendora::foobar, so it's a globally exposed
macro with possiblilty of collision.

IMHO, the key is that are we permitted to have a uniform interface to access
CSR, either standard or vendor designed ones, in other parts of QEMU.

In general, I agree with the point that vendor code should be self-contained.
Yet I have doubts that with the current design of CPU model, are we able to
unify the targets and in the meanwhile to keep things tight and neat ?

The execution flow will be bonded to have a shared instruction decoder/
translator and a shared handler for CSR (i.e. riscv_csrrw). It's not like we
get to choose what decoder we want to use or which CSR table we will be
using at xxx_cpu_init(). If we choose to use runtime check/diversion of all of
these parts, the overhead might be tremendous. 

Surely we should be focusing on CSR part for now, and just as you said, CSR
is not that perforamnce-centric.

Yet if we take a look at `configs/targets`, still we're having 6 MIPS32/64
linux-user targets, 4 ARM32/64 linux-user targets and 4 PPC32/64 linux-user
targets.

I guess it will be a very long journey to merge all the variants.

Just like the mentioned question above , I'm wondering if we can assume
riscv_csrrw() to be a general interface for accessing all the CSRs ?
