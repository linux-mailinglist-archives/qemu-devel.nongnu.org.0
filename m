Yes.  The commit message (tries to) explain exactly that.

I think we're disagreeing mostly on the meaning of terms, and in ways
that don't matter all that much.

When you say "any JSON impl that exists in any programming language",
then I understand "any conceivable implementation that conforms to the
specification".

Trouble is the specification underspecifies numbers to a degree that you
cannot know what conforming implementations will accept.  An
implementation that accepts just 0 would still be conforming.  It would
also be useless.  An implementation that accepts just 64 bit signed
integers would still be conforming.  Useless?  Depends.  My point is: we
cannot know what *all* implementations accept.

One of "know" and "all" will have to give.

My choice is to relax in accordance with the guidance from RFC 7159 and
8259 I quoted (and you snipped):

    This specification allows implementations to set limits on the range
    and precision of numbers accepted.  Since software that implements
    IEEE 754-2008 binary64 (double precision) numbers [IEEE754] is
    generally available and widely used, good interoperability can be
    achieved by implementations that expect no more precision or range
    than these provide, in the sense that implementations will
    approximate JSON numbers within the expected precision.  A JSON
    number such as 1E400 or 3.141592653589793238462643383279 may indicate
    potential interoperability problems, since it suggests that the
    software that created it expects receiving software to have greater
    capabilities for numeric magnitude and precision than is widely
    available.

    Note that when such software is used, numbers that are integers and
    are in the range [-(2**53)+1, (2**53)-1] are interoperable in the
    sense that implementations will agree exactly on their numeric
    values.

Bottom line: limiting integer use to 53 bits signed is likely to
maximize interoperability with common implementations.  It might well
achieve interoperability with all implementations that matter to us.  I
think that's close enough to "all" to stop arguing about the difference.
If you insist to call it "all" going forward, I'll silently
error-correct it to "enough".

You just relaxed your categorical "all" to just "credible" :)

Double-checking: do you propose to encode *all* numbers as strings, or
just certain "problematic" numbers?

If the latter, I guess your idea of "problematic" is "not representable
exactly as double precision floating-point".

Eric, too.  Consider it eliminated.

If we add a QMP capability for interoperability with JSON
implementations that set limits on range and precision that are
incompatible with the ones QMP sets, one could argue we effectively pay
the price for option 3, so we should take it for its benefits.

Option 1 without a QMP capability merely reverts the change we made in
2.10.  We can do that if we think it's sufficient.

You expressed a strong preference for maximizing interoperability (via
option 3).  Acknowledged.  However, I care a lot more about issues we
know we have than about issues somebody might have.

You mentioned the libvirt's switch to Jansson you had to abort due to
QMP sending numbers Jansson refuses to parse.  That's the kind of
non-hypothetical issue that can make me mess with the QMP language.

You wrote Jansson "raises a fatal parse error for unsigned 64-bit values
above 2^63-1".  Does that mean it rejects 9223372036854775808, but
accepts 9223372036854775808.0 (with loss of precision)?
