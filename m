Following up with this discussion, I'm gathering requirements for the
asset management architecture on Avocado.

So far, these are the use cases I could gather from e-mail
discussions, Avocado meetings, and individual talks followed by the
Trello board cards I found that may be related:

- Ability to skip a test when an asset is not available [4];
- Download the assets previous to the test start (covered on version
73 of Avocado):
    - Using the command line [5];
    - Or transparently to the test execution, during the pre-job
execution phase [6];
- Manually add an asset to the cache [8]:
    - By copying the asset to the cache;
    - By adding a reference to the cache, or maybe using a location
other than the cache;
- Reference an asset globally, like a module object accessible by
different tests [9];
- Collect assets from a test [1,3]

Following are the Trello Board cards I found on Avocado and Avocado +
QEMU boards related to assets:

Avocado Trello Board:

- Backlog:

[1] Add support to specify assets in test docstring -

[2] Asset Fetcher: avoid recalculation of cached hash and locking
errors - https://trello.com/c/WdnjY4n7/1528-asset-fetcher-avoid-recalculati=

[3] RFC: NRunner: extended metadata -

- Work in progress:

[4] On cache check for asset fetcher -

- Completed:

[6] Extend Assets plugin to run the fetch during JobPreTests -

Avocado + QEMU Trello Board:

- Backlog:

[7] Mirror fedora/debian images on
https://avocado-project.org/data/assets/ -
https://trello.com/c/vY8eg0eZ/102-mirror-fedora-debian-images-on-https-avoc=

[8] ability to add artifacts manually -
https://trello.com/c/czLc1Ouc/114-ability-to-add-artifacts-manually
[9] asset_library - https://trello.com/c/gJsXJz57/120-assetlibrary
[10] CI jobs shouldn't fail if image download fails -
https://trello.com/c/gJyVHCz2/122-ci-jobs-shouldnt-fail-if-image-download-f=
ails
[11] offline mode - https://trello.com/c/DRnMsEEZ/113-offline-mode

My objective is to create a parent tracking card on the Avocado Trello
board listing individual task-related cards mapped to the use case
requirements. As a start point, I will create the card tree with the
use cases I gathered and, later, add any other missing use cases that
we cover in this thread.

Any confirmation of use cases or proposals of other use cases is
appreciated to improve Avocado's ability to run your tests.
