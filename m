Yep, manual says it requires "Developer" permissions which is certainly
not something we want to give out widely, as it grants way too much
privilege.

I'd still suggest we look at folding the wiki into either the website or
the main repo documentation as appropriate for the docs in question.
Having 3 separate sources of documentation just feels wrong to me, and
we largely lost the "drive by" contributor for the wiki since we had
to lock new account creation - only a handful of people actually ask us
to create accounts for them.

The qemu-web.git could be made fairly low overhead for contributors by
accepting contributions via merge requests, which would let people just
interatively edit the web pages and submit the changes all from the web
UI. Not quite as seemless as a wiki, but not far off.

We could even demarcate a subset of the website with a /wiki URL and just
stuff all current wiki content in there as RST. Then have a much looser
review policy for merging changes in that subtree. Basically allow anything
as long as it is well formatted and not grossly incorrect. Could even 100%
automate approval under that subdir if you want the true wiki experiance
of having no content review.


The main downside with the main qemu.git documentation is that it takes
a long time to get docs through the contribution workflow and you have
to deal with the qemu-devel firehose. Use of RST has improved the authoring
part, but review/merge is still a bit tedious. There is no single docs
maintainer, and parts of docs are completely lacking maintainer entries.
So it can be pot-luck whether your docs contribution gets reviewed and
merged in reasonable time.

Regards,
Daniel
