Wouldn't that be a bit unexpected? There could be jobs unrelated to
migration or jobs at early stages. But sure, being able to trigger the
assertion is not nice.

Potential alternatives could be pausing the jobs or failing migration
with a clean error?

For us, the former is still best done in combination with a way to
switch to active (i.e. write-blocking) mode for drive-mirror.

The latter would force us to complete the drive-mirror job before
switchover even with active (i.e. write-blocking) mode, breaking our
usage of drive-mirror+migration that worked (in almost all cases, but it
would have been all cases if we had used active mode ;)) for many years now.

Maybe adding an option for how the jobs should behave upon switchover
(e.g. complete/pause/cancel/cancel-migration) could help? Either as a
job-specific option (more flexible) or a migration option?
