Different guest xattr prefixes have distinct access control rules applied
by the guest. When remapping a guest xattr care must be taken that the
remapping does not allow the a guest user to bypass guest kernel access
control rules.

For example if 'trusted.*' which requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN is remapped
to 'user.virtiofs.trusted.*', an unprivileged guest user which can
write to 'user.*' can bypass the CAP_SYS_ADMIN control. Thus the
target of any remapping must be explicitly blocked from read/writes
by the guest, to prevent access control bypass.

The examples shown in the virtiofsd man page already do the right
thing and ensure safety, but the security implications of getting
this wrong were not made explicit. This could lead to host admins
and apps unwittingly creating insecure configurations.

-xattr-mapping Examples
-----------------------
+Security considerations
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Operating systems typically partition the xattr namespace using
+well defined name prefixes. Each partition may have different
+access controls applied. For example, on Linux there are multiple
+partitions
+
+ * ``system.*`` - access varies depending on attribute & filesystem
+ * ``security.*`` - only processes with CAP_SYS_ADMIN
+ * ``trusted.*`` - only processes with CAP_SYS_ADMIN
+ * ``user.*`` - any process granted by file permissions / ownership
+
+While other OS such as FreeBSD have different name prefixes
+and access control rules.
+
+When remapping attributes on the host, it is important to
+ensure that the remapping does not allow a guest user to
+evade the guest access control rules.
+
+Consider if ``trusted.*`` from the guest was remapped to
+``user.virtiofs.trusted*`` in the host. An unprivileged
+user in a Linux guest has the ability to write to xattrs
+under ``user.*``. Thus the user can evade the access
+control restriction on ``trusted.*`` by instead writing
+to ``user.virtiofs.trusted.*``.
+
+As noted above, the partitions used and access controls
+applied, will vary across guest OS, so it is not wise to
+try to predict what the guest OS will use.
+
+The simplest way to avoid an insecure configuration is
+to remap all xattrs at once, to a given fixed prefix.
+This is shown in example (1) below.
+
+If selectively mapping only a subset of xattr prefixes,
+then rules must be added to explicitly block direct
+access to the target of the remapping. This is shown
+in example (2) below.
