OK but how do these relate to inexact flag and why is that the one that's=
=20
checked for using hardfloat? Also rounding mode is checked but why can't=20
we set the same mode on host and why only use hardfloat in one specific=20
rounding mode? These two checks seem to further limit hardfloat use beyon=
d=20
the above cases or are these the same?

I've only had a quick look at it but seems to not discuss all details.=20
They say the ARM instruction they wanted to emulate have some non-standar=
d=20
flush-to-zero behaviour where exceptions (including inexact) are handled=20
differently. Is this related to the check above and if yes shouldn't that=
=20
only apply to ARM target? Other standard compliant target probably should=
=20
not be limited by this.

They've also found out that clearing and reading host FP flags is "slower=
=20
than QEMU" which is what we have for PPC currently. They say the solution=
=20
is to not use host exceptions at all but calculate the exception flags=20
from software looking at inputs and result instead maybe trying different=
=20
FP ops that test for the exception cases. Unfortunately this paper does=20
not describe how exactly that's done just say maybe it will be described=20
later. It seems like kind of softfloat but using FPU for actual=20
calculation and deduce exeptions without access to intermediate reaults=20
that softfloat may be using. So they can use hardware for calculation=20
which should be the largest part and calculate the flags from software.=20
This way they claim 1.24 to 3.36 times speed up compared to then QEMU=20
(using only softfloat I guess which is still what we have for PPC today).

It's this patch:
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/875764/

This at least shows where to hook in FP exception handling but based on=20
the above paper maybe that's not the best solution after all but may wort=
h=20
a try anyway in case it's simpler than what they did.

Which is slower? Clearing exception flags before every op and reading the=
m=20
again or trapping for exceptions? I'd expect even if exceptions are commo=
n=20
they should be less frequent than every op (otherwise they would not be=20
"exceptional").

> - reading host FPU flag registers turns out to be pretty expensive

That's what using exceptions should avoid. If we only need to read and=20
clear flags when exception happens that should be less frequent than doin=
g=20
that for every FP op. Hopefully even with the additional overhead of=20
calling the handler if all the handler has to do is set a corresponding=20
flag in a global.
