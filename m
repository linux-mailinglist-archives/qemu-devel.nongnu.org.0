"defined" might be a bit strong.  We have on multiple occasions
required synchronized SLOF and qemu updates in order to keep
presenting the same guest environment.

Well, sure, but we don't want that definition to introduce lots of
complexity we have to maintain on top of the existing HV and firmware
interfaces that are defined.

I realized what I said about the firmware interfaces requiring HV
privilege was a bit misleading.  For the boot time firmware
components, such as the OF client interface, that's mostly not true
(with the big and hairy exception of the
ibm,client-architecture-support feature negotiation mechanism).

It is, however, true of the runtime RTAS interfaces.  In fact it's
true to the point that, at least for most of the RTAS interfaces we
care about, it's hard to imagine an in-guest implementation doing
anything much other than repackaging the information it gets and
forwarding it to the hypervisor.  For most purposes RTAS is pretty
much an alternative hypercall mechanism.  So, I think implementing the
RTAS entirely in qemu was the right choice.

Where it gets complicated is that a number of RTAS calls need to match
IDs with stuff from the boot time firmware.  Particularly phandles of
device nodes, and some other IDs.

Which would be fine if the boot time firmware took the device tree
=66rom qemu and used it unmodified.  But.. it doesn't, quite.  In
particular it assigns its own phandles, because it uses them as an
internal index.  And worse, clients can alter the device tree, and
this is used to a small extent - grub pokes a few values in there for
use later.
