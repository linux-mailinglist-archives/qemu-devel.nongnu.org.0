I think that is so marginal that its lost in the noise compared to
everything else that's done in QEMU. Essentially someone can pick
a value that is so large that it tickles some other problem in QEMU
or their firmware. We're not promising to fix such problems if they
occurs. It'll be perfectly valid to say "dont do that" if someone
sets a value that breaks something else and we don't consider it
worth the time to investigate and fix.

I think that's only relevant if the change is imposing a significant
maint burden which needs to be justified. Not the case here IMHO.

I don't see this is relevant. If OVMF maintainers want to reject
feature proposals they have the right to do that regardless of what
QEMU sets for max image size. As you say earlier, the existing size
limit is already enourmous compared to what OVMF actually uses, so
if this was a real problem it'd already exist.

Daniel
