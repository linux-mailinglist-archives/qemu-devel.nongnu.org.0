There are three cases where qemu sends an ExtendedDesktopSize message:

  (1) during the initial handshake (to cover the feature detection).
  (2) as response to a SetDesktopSize request, and
  (3) when an resize happens.

So, yes, I skimmed the spec a bit to fast and didn't implement it
correctly.  Which also explains why you can't trigger the infinite
loop issue.

Yes, it doesn't make much sense.

Not fully sure I should consider this a bug or a feature.
This patch doesn't conform to the spec.
But it clearly is more robust ...

take care,
