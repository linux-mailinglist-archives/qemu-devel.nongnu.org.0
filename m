The memory type is chosen by QEMU, not the user.  Why should QEMU warn
the user when it chooses DDR, but not when it chooses DDR2?

I challenge this idea.

The kind of RAM module a board accepts is a property of the board.
Modelling that in board code is sensible and easy.  Attempting to model
it in a one size fits all helper function is unlikely to work for all
boards.

Apparently some boards (including malta) need two banks, so your helper
increases the number of banks from one to two, but only when that's
possible without changing the type.

What if another board needs one bank?  Four?  Two even if that requires
changing the type?  You'll end up with a bunch of flags to drive the
helper's magic.  Not yet because the helper has a grand total of *two*
users, and much of its magic is used by neither, as demonstrated by
PATCH 2.

If you want magic, have a non-magic function that does exactly what it's
told, and a magic one to tell it what to do.  The non-magic one will be
truly reusable.  You can have any number of magic ones.  Boards with
sufficiently similar requirements can share a magic one.

When a commit fixes something, it should say so.  This one does not:

    commit 08fd99179a8c5d34c7065e2ad76c7f8b6afe239e

        sam460ex: Clean up SPD EEPROM creation

        Get rid of code from MIPS Malta board used to create SPD EEPROM dat=
a
        (parts of which was not even needed for sam460ex) and use the gener=
ic
        spd_data_generate() function to simplify this.

This commit message certainly suggests it was a refactoring that did not
change SPD data at all.  Not the case, but you have to look at the patch
closely to see.  Water under the bridge, of course.

It misled me to assume the change was unintentional.

You're right: 08fd99179a8^ appears not to boot with -m 128 and lower.
08fd99179a8 was indeed a silent bug fix.

"make check" passes, though :)

I'll replace this patch by one that merely suppresses the warning.

Thanks!
