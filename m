Fixing.  (Do you ever wonder if I leave a typo in, just to check that 
reviewers were actually reviewing?  But in this case, it was a symptom 
of me posting a series late at night to start the review process, even 
though I _really_ need to post a v3 that adds even more iotest coverage 
of every new deprecation warning made possible in this patch)

Good idea.  How about:

...to retroactively add a backing format to an existing image.  However, 
be aware that there are already potential security risks to using 
'qemu-img info' to probe the format of an untrusted backing image, when 
deciding what format to write into an image with 'qemu-img rebase -u'.

Yes, I think I missed a spot (blame the late-night push to get the patch 
out the door).  I'll wait to see if I get review from the qemu side 
before posting v3, though.
