See my v3 I posted yesterday; I've made this a lot simpler by just
turning the alignment off for vhost-kernel and only enabling it for
vhost-user;  vhost-user skips any section without a backing fd anyway,
so the synic problem goes away, as does another problem reported by
Peter Lieven that he was seeing that seemed like one of the VGA regions
getting in the way (which I'd not seen before).
