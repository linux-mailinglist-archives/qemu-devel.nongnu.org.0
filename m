I actually had this variant in the exact same way as you're suggesting here as 
well before (not submitted to the list though), that is I had a version of 
this function with a count argument, and I had 3 separate qtest cases, but 
that variant failed in the exact same way.

Furthermore, I even get some strange "could not push stack" error messages 
from the qtest environment when I just add some empty noop tests to the 9pfs 
test suite. I am not sure if that's related to this ringbuffer issue here, but 
it was a show stopper for this 'separate test for each count' variant, so I 
reverted it to this suggested array solution for now.

So to avoid any misapprehension: it seems to me as if you were thinking that 
the ringbuffer is freed between every individual test. That's not what I am 
observing here. It rather seems as space in the ringbuffer is never freed 
(before the entire 9pfs test suite completed).
