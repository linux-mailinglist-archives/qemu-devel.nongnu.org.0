But then I think it's the user's responsibility to make sure that the
backing file still makes sense when they reattach it. You can't tell
QEMU that there is no backing file and then expect QEMU to take care of
your secret backing file.

Of course, we could unconditionally zero out the new area without
looking at the backing file, but I'm not sure if that is wanted.

No, that would mean that all images must be preallocated because
BDRV_BLOCK_ALLOCATED isn't supposed to be set for sparse blocks.

Essentially, the mode that you're envisioning for it is the same as
PREALLOC_MODE_METADATA today (except that it would have to be supported
by every driver).

Obviously, that's wrong for PREALLOC_MODE_OFF.

Why would a qcow2 file even have a backing file when you don't want to
ever access the backing file? Create your image without a backing file
and you get the behaviour you want.
