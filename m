In which way does a guest get notified?

AFAICT XEN_DOMCTL_deassign_device doesn't do any kind of guest
notification, it just tears down the device.

That would be my expectation. Such deassignment/assignment should be
completely transparent from a guest PoV. My suggestion for doing
the reassignment is to ensure there's no device state carried over.

Doing all this cleanup without reassigning the device seems more
complicated and likely to miss stuff to cleanup IMO, but as long as
you can guarantee there's no state carried over from before the reset
it should be fine.

I think you also need some dom0 cooperation for this, so that for
example the BARs are correctly re-positioned after the reset?

Thanks, Roger.
