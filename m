The idea of rounding the distances like this seems pretty good to me.
Since each level is a multiple of a distance from the preivous one it
might be more theoretically correct to place the thresholds at the
geometric mean between each level, rather than the arithmetic mean.  I
very much doubt it makes much different in practice though, and this
is simpler.

There is one nit, I'm less happy with though..

=2E.I don't love the fact that we alter the distance table in place.
Even though it was never exposed to the guest, I'd prefer not to
destroy the information the user passed in.  It could lead to
surprising results with QMP introspection, and it may make future
extensions more difficult.

So I'd prefer to either (a) just leave the table as is and round
on-demand with a paprify_distance(NN) -> {20,40,80,..} type function,
or (b) create a parallel, spapr local, table with the rounded
distances
