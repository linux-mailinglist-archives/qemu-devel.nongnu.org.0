I did smoke test it (Fedora boot loop) [*] on s390 host with hacked
1G max section. I guess I could hack x86 and do the same for x86 guest.
Anyways, suggestions how to test it better are welcome.

*) I don't have much faith in tests we have though as it didn't
   explode with broken v5 in my case. Hence CCing ones who is more
   familiar with migration parts.

   I used 2 memslot split config at 1Gb with offline migration like this:

   $ qemu-system-s390x -M s390-ccw-virtio -m 2048 -cpu max -smp 2 -M accel=kvm  \
        --nographic --hda fedora.qcow2 -serial unix:/tmp/s,server,nowait \
        -monitor stdio 
     (monitor) stop
     (monitor) migrate "exec: cat > savefile
     (monitor) q
   $ qemu-system-s390x -M s390-ccw-virtio -m 2048 -cpu max -smp 2 -M accel=kvm  \
        --nographic --hda fedora.qcow2 -serial unix:/tmp/s,server,nowait \
        -incoming "exec: cat savefile"

there is another broken board that misuses it as well,
I intend to clean that up and drop memory_region_allocate_system_memory()
altogether once s390 case is dealt with.
