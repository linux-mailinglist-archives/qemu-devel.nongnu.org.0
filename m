Yup, we should.

If you do this, you can just declare it as non-Optional. Whenever it 
exists, it is definitely a subprocess.Popen[bytes].

As long as the style checkers are OK with that sort of thing. After a 
very quick test, it seems like they might be.

Generally, we run into trouble because pylint et al want variables to be 
declared in __init__, but doing so requires Optional[T] most of the time 
to allow something to be initialized later.

A lot of our stateful objects have this kind of pattern. QAPIGen has a 
ton of it. machine.py has a ton of it too.

You can basically imply the stateful check by just foregoing the actual 
initialization, which trades the explicit check for the implicit one 
when you get the AttributeError.

This is maybe more convenient -- less code to write, certainly. The 
error message you get I think is going to be a little worse, though.

I think I have been leaning towards the cute little @property shims 
because it follows a familiar OO model where a specific class always has 
a finite set of properties that does not grow or shrink. You can also 
use the shim to give a meaningful error that might be nicer to read than 
the AttributeError.

I'm open to suggestions on better patterns. I had considered at one 
point that it might be nice to split Machine out into a version with and 
without the console to make stronger typing guarantees. It has 
implications for how shutdown and cleanup and so on is handled, too.

(I had some WIP patches to do this, but I think I got a little stuck 
making the code pretty, and then the release, and then I got busy, and...)

Thanks; I'll continue with this for now, but I really am open to talking 
about better ways to model the common pattern of "Optional sub-feature 
for a class that can be engaged post-initialization".

It's an interesting typing problem. If we were using semantic types, 
what we are describing is an f(x) such that:

f(object-without-feature) -> object-with-feature

It's a kind of semantic cast where we are doing something akin to an 
in-place transformation of a base type to a subtype. I'm not sure I have 
encountered any language that actually intentionally supports such a 
paradigm.

(Maybe haskell? I just assume haskell can do everything if you learn to 
lie to computers well enough.)
