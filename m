How does this interact with the way we already document our
level of security support in docs/system/security.rst ?

The difficulty with this is that MAINTAINERS is not set up
with a split between "security issues" and "non-security
issues". For instance this stanza:

> @@ -149,6 +161,7 @@ ARM TCG CPUs
>  M: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>

>  F: tests/tcg/aarch64/

you have marked "Low", but the files it covers include
both ones used by TCG (not security-critical) and ones
used by KVM (security-critical).

Also, MAINTAINERS is not user-facing. If we want to say
that vvfat or 9pfs are not suitable for use on a security
boundary and that we do not consider bugs in them to
be security issues, we should do that in the user-facing
documentation.

Broadly speaking, it feels like you're trying to come up
with an automatic way to say "does this patch touch a
security-relevant part of the code", and I'm not sure
that that's possible.

Something in your patch workflow is mangling UTF-8 characters,
incidentally.
