I refer to the specification of LDP and STP on AARCH64. The 
specification allows

"any access performed before the exception was taken is repeated".

In detailed,

"If, according to these rules, an instruction is executed as a sequence of accesses, exceptions, including interrupts,
can be taken during that sequence, regardless of the memory type being accessed. If any of these exceptions are
returned from using their preferred return address, the instruction that generated the sequence of accesses is
re-executed, and so any access performed before the exception was taken is repeated. See also Taking an interrupt
during a multi-access load or store on page D1-4664."

However I see the implementation of LDP and STP on QEMU are in different 
ways. LDP will only load the first register when it ensures no trap in 
the second access.

So I have two questions here.

1) One for the QEMU implementation about LDP. Can we implement the LDP 
as two directly loads to cpu registers instead of local TCG temps?

2) One for the comment. Why register state changes cause 
non-restartable? Do you mean if the first register changes, it may 
influence the calculation of address after the trap?

"Even with a trap in the middle the stores are restartable, since no register state changes."

Thanks, I will fix the manual.

      Depends on what the hardware does.  Even with a trap in the middle
      the stores are restartable, since no register state changes.

      Yes.  Conciser what happens when the insn is encoded with .long. 
      Does the hardware trap an illegal instruction?  Is the behavior
