AFAICT, migration-test explicitly skip tests if kvm_hv isn't present.

    /*
     * On ppc64, the test only works with kvm-hv, but not with kvm-pr and TCG
     * is touchy due to race conditions on dirty bits (especially on PPC for
     * some reason)
     */
    if (g_str_equal(qtest_get_arch(), "ppc64") &&
        access("/sys/module/kvm_hv", F_OK)) {
        g_test_message("Skipping test: kvm_hv not available");
        return g_test_run();
    }

and I don't see any error in pxe-test if I force tcg and vsmt=8.

What error do you see with your testing ?
