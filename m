Agreed, the only thing that fixed-ram alone really does is to
ensure you have a finite file size if you're saving the state
while the VM is running, because successive dirtying of the
same block will write to the same location in file. Nice to
avoid wasting storage and gives a small speed up on restore.

It isn't going to give the massive speedup you're looking for
though. multifd + O_DIRECT is a critical followup piece to
achieve the major performance improvement. The fixed-ram
feature makes it practical to use multifd, without needing
to split content streams across many files, or have to invent
a way to splice multiple streams into the same file.

With regards,
Daniel
