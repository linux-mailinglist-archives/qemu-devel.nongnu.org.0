My worry isn't actually how painful adding all the iommu glue is, but
what happens when users forget; especially if they forget for one
device.

I could appreciate having a machine option to cause iommu to then get
turned on with all other devices; but I think also we could do with
something that failed with a nice error if an iommu flag was missing.
For SEV this could be done pretty early, but for power/s390 I guess
you'd have to do this when someone tried to enable secure mode, but
I'm not sure you can tell.
