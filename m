Yes.  We only use this configuration of QEMU as an instruction-set 
simulator so that we can test cross-compilers and gdb for bare-metal 
aarch64-none-elf target, using newlib as the target C library and the 
GDB semihosting support in QEMU for low-level fileio primitives.

BTW, I did not run into this undefined-symbol error when building the 
equivalent configuration for bare-metal nios2-elf target with the same 
sysroot and host setup.  That target does not build libvhost-user at all.

I wouldn't mind just applying a local patch to fix the build.  What I'm 
really trying to do is just get help in understanding what broke this, 
so I can come up with such a patch to un-break it again.

We update our host build environment infrequently, and we've still had 
customers requiring CentOS 6 support until quite recently.
