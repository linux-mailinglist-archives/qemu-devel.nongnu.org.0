Ok, that's not viable then. We can't switch one regression for a different
regression.

True, but that is at least historically expected behaviour, which can
be fixed by setting <backingfile/> in the XML file IIUC.

I'm a little lost as to exactly which scenarios are broken, and which
we're fixing.

 1. file:top.qcow2 -> file:base.raw

 2. file:top.qcow2 -> file:base.qcow2

 3. file:top.qcow2 -> file:middle.qcow2 -> file:base.raw
=20
 4. file:top.qcow2 -> file:middle.qcow2 -> file:base.qcow2

IIUC, (1) is working before and now, (2) is working before but
broken now, and (3) and (4) were broken before and now.

So (2) is the only one we /must/ to fix

Am I right that by doing probing in libvirt as per this patch,
as well as fixing (2) though, we'll accidentally fix (3) and (4)
even though they were always broken before ?

This all talks about qcow2 images on the file: protocol driver.
What is the situation for, say, the iscsi: protocol driver


 1. iscsi:top.qcow2 -> iscsi:base.raw

 2. iscsi:top.qcow2 -> iscsi:base.qcow2

 3. iscsi:top.qcow2 -> iscsi:middle.qcow2 -> iscsi:base.raw
=20
 4. iscsi:top.qcow2 -> iscsi:middle.qcow2 -> iscsi:base.qcow2

What was the behaviour of this in the pre-blockdev days and
vs current git master ? Is it the same with (1) is working
before and now, (2) is working before but broken now, and
(3) and (4) were broken before and now.

I'm assuming the libvirt probing cannot fix any case other
than file: protocol, or host-device: protocol, since we're
unable to open any other type of storage.
