You're using v2 unless you're on a very old kernel.

I appreciate good trace code, but I don't appreciate code bloat for the
sake of tracing, which is what I'd consider the name fields here.  Do
it in the trace-event or require that the user needs to cross reference
the header to turn the integer type into a name themselves.  Thanks,
