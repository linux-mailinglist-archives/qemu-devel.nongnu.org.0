They use common subroutines, but their bodies check different conditions, so I
don't think merging would be an improvement.  We do provide a new helper 
qf_file_open() which could replace a handful of lines in both qmp_xen_save_devices_state 
and qmp_xen_load_devices_state.

Sure. The first use case allows you to kexec reboot the host and update host
software and/or qemu.  It does not preserve descriptors, and guest ram must be
backed by persistant shared memory.  Guest pause time depends on host reboot
time, which can be seconds to 10's of seconds.

The second case allows you to update qemu in place, but not update the host.
Guest ram can be in shared or anonymous memory.  We call madvise(MADV_DOEXEC)
to tell the kernel to preserve anon memory across the exec.  Open descriptors
are preserved.  Addresses and lengths of saved memory segments are saved in
the environment, and the values of descriptors are saved.  When new qemu
restarts, it finds those values in the environment and uses them when the
various objects are created.  Memory is not realloc'd, it is already present,
and the address and lengths are saved in the ram objects.  Guest pause time
is in the 100 to 200 msec range.  It is less resource intensive than live
migration, and is appropriate if your only goal is to update qemu, as opposed
to evacuating a host.

Yes, I have experimented with the guest's suspend method.
