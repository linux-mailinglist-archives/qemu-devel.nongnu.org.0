This one is convenient to use, but the problem is that nobody enforces
that errp is always set if ret < 0, and that it's not set for ret == 0.
So in a way it is error-prone because it allows inconsistencies.

I mainly don't like this very much because it's simply wrong.

Callers can pass errp = NULL if they aren't interested in error
information. If you directly pass errp, you can't check *errp because
errp could be NULL.

So directly passing errp makes the code simpler, but only use it in
functions where you don't intend to check whether an error is set.

local_err exists for those cases where you need to check the error
object before passing it to the caller. (And obviously for those cases
where you don't want to pass it to the caller, but do something like
error_report_err().)

There are two parts to the change that you imply:

1. Forbid passing errp = NULL to any function so that *errp can always
   be checked. This gets rid of local_err in the intermediate function,
   but may require the introduction of new local_err variables in
   top-level callers which ignore the error information.

2. Introduce failure(errp) to replace errp != NULL because we want Error
   to contain warnings and notes, too. Currently, it can contain only
   exactly one error, so this would be a major change.

   Note that the change wouldn't make the existing 'if (errp)' checks
   build failures, so getting confident that we found and replaced all
   of them is going to be hard.

Essentially, you'd probably want to replace Error with a new type so
that the compiler will at least be able to tell which places have been
converted and which haven't.

And then, you'd have to touch every single function that does something
with errors. This is a huge change across the whole source tree.

I doubt it's worth the effort.

I agree, it's not the high-level operation the user requested that is
deprecated, but just the specific implementation libvirt uses to perform
the operation on a QEMU VM.

The expected response to a deprecation notice is that a libvirt update
makes it go away by using more modern interfaces, not that the user
changes their workflow.
