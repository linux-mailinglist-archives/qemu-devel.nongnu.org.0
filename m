Ageed. I will do the cosmetics and send out the v2.

Regarding validation, I don't know where the criteria Farhan implemented
come from. In the longer run we may want to do away with the validation
and normalization performed in the setter, but for now I think this is
pretty close to the sanest cheap fix we can do.
