Distros don't really do "deprecation" as a concept though.
They will continue to ship an old version of a library for
as long as they need to ship some application that consumes
it. IOW, the fact that SDL 1.2 exists still indicates that some
application the distro cares about is unable to build with
SDL 2 yet.

For this reason you'll even see distros still shipping GTK-1,
despite GTK-2 being released in 2002 and GTK-3 in 2011 and
GTK-4 appearing real soon.  IOW, it wouldn't surprise me if
SDL 1.2 exists in distros for another 10 years, despite the
upstream project considering it obsolete long ago. This
doesn't mean it is desirable / neccessary to continue to
support SDL 1.2 in downstream apps, when SDL 2 is widely
available.
