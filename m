The same place as all the ordinary specs:
https://github.com/devicetree-org/dt-schema/blob/main/dtschema/schemas/chosen.yaml

No, I don't think so. If anything, I'll try to get rid of kaslr-seed
upstream at some point if that makes sense. But until that happens --
that is, until I have the conversations with people who added these and
care about their semantics -- assume that there's granularity for some
good reason. No need to put the cart before the horse.

This is a simple patch doing a simple thing in exactly the way that
things are already being done. I really don't want to do much more than
that here. If you want to bikeshed it further, send a follow up patch.

Jason
