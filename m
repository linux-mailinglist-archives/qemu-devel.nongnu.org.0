Vector instructions will never be really disabled in this way, only 
misa.V bit is cleared, since

zve64d/f  will be implicitly enabled when RVV is enabled, they will 
continue to work even if misa.V is cleared.

And we can never disabled F/D when V is firstly enabled, even if we 
disable them together with V.

Yeah, I agree this is an acceptable way for write_misa. However, I think 
it's better if we can distinguish

the Z extensions  implicitly enabled by misa extension(which can be 
disabled/re-enabled by write_misa) with

explicitly enabled Z extensions(which cannot).
