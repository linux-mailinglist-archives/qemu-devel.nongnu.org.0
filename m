I care more about sam460ex but limitations are similar (with different=20
list of supported DIMMs). This comes from how the SoC's memory controller=
=20
stores memory size (that's similar to how SPD data encodes it) so we can'=
t=20
represent different size.

On real hardware one cannot have invalid RAM size because you can only=20
plug DIMMs of above sizes so the problem does not happen. The argument wa=
s=20
more that it worked before and now users may find their previously workin=
g=20
options to error out. Current version of this patch is better as it gives=
=20
valid option so the user who does not know about SoC limitations can just=
=20
use the printed value and doesn't have to calculate valid value.

This version is acceptable and I can live with it. If every other board i=
s=20
happy with returning error then it's OK to do the same here as long as=20
it's easy for users to fix their command line by using the printed value.
