Markus was going to introduce new QAPI schema syntax that would allow to
specify a few options explicitly and then one option for "the rest" that
would just be mapped to a QDict like "any" or "gen": false, and that
wouldn't require any nesting.

I'm not sure if any progress was made there, but making things
consistent between device_add, netdev_add and object_add was a step in
this direction anyway.

It went through my tree because of the other patches in the series, but
I wrote this patch specifically at Markus's request.

Please discuss it with Markus then.
