hi Parav,
the example is based on a new vdpa tool running over netlink, not based
on devlink, right?
For vfio migration compatibility, we have to deal with both mdev and physical
pci devices, I don't think it's a good idea to write a new tool for it, given
we are able to retrieve the same info from sysfs and there's already an
mdevctl from Alex (https://github.com/mdevctl/mdevctl).

hi All,
could we decide that sysfs is the interface that every VFIO vendor driver
needs to provide in order to support vfio live migration, otherwise the
userspace management tool would not list the device into the compatible
list?

if that's true, let's move to the standardizing of the sysfs interface.
(1) content
common part: (must)
   - software_version: (in major.minor.bugfix scheme)
   - device_api: vfio-pci or vfio-ccw ...
   - type: mdev type for mdev device or
           a signature for physical device which is a counterpart for
	   mdev type.

device api specific part: (must)
  - pci id: pci id of mdev parent device or pci id of physical pci
    device (device_api is vfio-pci)
  - subchannel_type (device_api is vfio-ccw) 
 
vendor driver specific part: (optional)
  - aggregator
  - chpid_type
  - remote_url

NOTE: vendors are free to add attributes in this part with a
restriction that this attribute is able to be configured with the same
name in sysfs too. e.g.
for aggregator, there must be a sysfs attribute in device node
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/882cc4da-dede-11e7-9180-078a62063ab1/intel_vgpu/aggregator,
so that the userspace tool is able to configure the target device
according to source device's aggregator attribute.


(2) where and structure
proposal 1:
|- [path to device]
  |--- migration
  |     |--- self
  |     |    |-software_version
  |     |    |-device_api
  |     |    |-type
  |     |    |-[pci_id or subchannel_type]
  |     |    |-<aggregator or chpid_type>
  |     |--- compatible
  |     |    |-software_version
  |     |    |-device_api
  |     |    |-type
  |     |    |-[pci_id or subchannel_type]
  |     |    |-<aggregator or chpid_type>
multiple compatible is allowed.
attributes should be ASCII text files, preferably with only one value
per file.


proposal 2: use bin_attribute.
|- [path to device]
  |--- migration
  |     |--- self
  |     |--- compatible

so we can continue use multiline format. e.g.
cat compatible
  software_version=0.1.0
  device_api=vfio_pci
  type=i915-GVTg_V5_{val1:int:1,2,4,8}
  pci_id=80865963
  aggregator={val1}/2

Thanks
Yan
