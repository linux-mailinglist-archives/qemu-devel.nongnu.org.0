hmm... sorry, I didn't find the referred discussion. only below discussion
regarding to why to add devlink.

https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg95801.html

	It is related to networking quite bit. There has been couple of
	iteration of this, including sysfs and configfs implementations. There
	has been a consensus reached that this should be done by netlink. I
	believe netlink is really the best for this purpose. Sysfs is not a good
	idea

	It is. However the current way is driver-specific, not correct.
	For mlx5, we need the same, it cannot be done in this way. Do devlink is
	the correct way to go.

https://lwn.net/Articles/674867/
	There a is need for some userspace API that would allow to expose things
	that are not directly related to any device class like net_device of
	ib_device, but rather chip-wide/switch-ASIC-wide stuff.

	Use cases:
	1) get/set of port type (Ethernet/InfiniBand)
	2) monitoring of hardware messages to and from chip
	3) setting up port splitters - split port into multiple ones and squash again,
	   enables usage of splitter cable
	4) setting up shared buffers - shared among multiple ports within one chip



we actually can also retrieve the same information through sysfs, .e.g

|- [path to device]
  |--- migration
  |     |--- self
  |     |   |---device_api
  |	|   |---mdev_type
  |	|   |---software_version
  |	|   |---device_id
  |	|   |---aggregator
  |     |--- compatible
  |     |   |---device_api
  |	|   |---mdev_type
  |	|   |---software_version
  |	|   |---device_id
  |	|   |---aggregator

so need to patch devlink core and the userspace devlink tool?
e.g. devlink migration

the advantage of netlink I see is that it can monitor device status and
notify upper layer that migration database needs to get updated.
But not sure whether openstack would like to use this capability.
As Sean said, it's heavy for openstack. it's heavy for vendor driver
as well :)

And devlink monitor now listens the notification and dumps the state
changes. If we want to use it, need to let it forward the notification
and dumped info to openstack, right?

Thanks
