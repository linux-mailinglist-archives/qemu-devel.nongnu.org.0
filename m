Hi David,

seems it works well also integrated with qemu, and there should be no problem in make clean,
as the version_gen should not get created anymore, the overall clean rule should take care
of objects and libs.

While bolting it to qemu I noticed that _avoiding_ passing down CFLAGS _and_ QEMU_CFLAGS is
necessary to avoid compilation errors. With those changes made, the integration of the
modified dtc seems to work.

the diff needed in qemu (note the absence of DTC_CFLAGS passed down as CFLAGS):

Subject: [PATCH] Makefile: dtc: build the libfdt target

call the libfdt target from the dtc Makefile, which has been
changed to not require bison, flex, etc.

scripts/ symlink and tests directory creation are not necessary,
and neither is calling the clean rule explicitly.
