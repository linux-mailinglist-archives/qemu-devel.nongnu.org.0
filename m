Laszlo,

Thanks for the detailed explanation.=20

Maybe I was overcomplicating this. Given your explanation I think the =
part I'm missing is OVMF is implying FLASH layout, in this split model, =
based on the size of the OVMF_CODE.fd and OVMF_VARS.fd.  Given that if =
OVMF_CODE.fd gets bigger the variable address changes from a QEMU point =
of view. So basically it is the QEMU  API that is making assumptions =
about the relative layout of the FD in the split model that makes a =
migration to larger ROM not work. Basically the -pflash API does not =
support changing the size of the ROM without moving NVRAM given the way =
it is currently defined.=20

Given the above it seems like the 2 options are:
1) Pad OVMF_CODE.fd to be very large so there is room to grow.
2) Add some feature to QUEM that allows the variable store address to =
not be based on OVMF_CODE.fd size.=20

I did see this [1] and combined with your email I either understand, or =
I'm still confused? :)

I'm not saying we need to change anything, I'm just trying to make sure =
I understand how OVMF and QEMU are tied to together.=20

Thanks,

class=3D""><br class=3D"">When you define a new domain (VM) on a =
virtualization host, the domain<br class=3D"">definition saves a =
reference (pathname) to the OVMF_CODE.fd file.<br class=3D"">However, =
the OVMF_VARS.fd file (the variable store *template*) is not<br =
class=3D"">directly referenced; instead, it is *copied* into a separate =
(private)<br class=3D"">file for the domain.<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">Furthermore, once booted, guest has two flash chips, one that =
maps the<br class=3D"">firmware executable OVMF_CODE.fd read-only, and =
another pflash chip that<br class=3D"">maps its private varstore file =
read-write.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">This makes it possible to =
upgrade OVMF_CODE.fd and OVMF_VARS.fd (via<br class=3D"">package =
upgrades on the virt host) without messing with varstores that<br =
class=3D"">were earlier instantiated from OVMF_VARS.fd. What's important =
here is<br class=3D"">that the various constants in the new (upgraded) =
OVMF_CODE.fd file<br class=3D"">remain compatible with the *old* =
OVMF_VARS.fd structure, across package<br class=3D"">upgrades.<br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">If that's not possible for introducing e.g. a =
new feature, then the<br class=3D"">package upgrade must not overwrite =
the OVMF_CODE.fd file in place, but<br class=3D"">must provide an =
additional firmware binary. This firmware binary can<br class=3D"">then =
only be used by freshly defined domains (old domains cannot be<br =
class=3D"">switched over). Old domains can be switched over manually -- =
and only if<br class=3D"">the sysadmin decides it is OK to lose the =
current variable store<br class=3D"">contents. Then the old varstore =
file for the domain is deleted<br class=3D"">(manually), the domain =
definition is updated, and then a new (logically<br class=3D"">empty, =
pristine) varstore can be created from the *new* OVMF_2_VARS.fd<br =
class=3D"">that matches the *new* OVMF_2_CODE.fd.<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D""><br class=3D"">During live migration, the "RAM-like" contents =
of both pflash chips are<br class=3D"">migrated (the guest-side view of =
both chips remains the same, including<br class=3D"">the case when the =
writeable chip happens to be in "programming mode",<br class=3D"">i.e., =
during a UEFI variable write through the Fault Tolerant Write and<br =
class=3D"">Firmware Volume Block(2) protocols).<br class=3D""><br =
class=3D"">Once live migration completes, QEMU dumps the full contents =
of the<br class=3D"">writeable chip to the backing file (on the =
destination host). Going<br class=3D"">forward, flash writes from within =
the guest are reflected to said<br class=3D"">host-side file on-line, =
just like it happened on the source host before<br class=3D"">live =
migration. If the file backing the r/w pflash chip is on NFS<br =
class=3D"">(shared by both src and dst hosts), then this one-time =
dumping when the<br class=3D"">migration completes is superfluous, but =
it's also harmless.<br class=3D""><br class=3D"">The interesting =
question is, what happens when you power down the VM on<br class=3D"">the =
destination host (=3D post migration), and launch it again there, =
from<br class=3D"">zero. In that case, the firmware executable file =
comes from the<br class=3D"">*destination host* (it was never =
persistently migrated from the source<br class=3D"">host, i.e. never =
written out on the dst). It simply comes from the OVMF<br =
class=3D"">package that had been installed on the destination host, by =
the<br class=3D"">sysadmin. However, the varstore pflash does reflect =
the permanent result<br class=3D"">of the previous migration. So this is =
where things can fall apart, if<br class=3D"">both firmware binaries (on =
the src host and on the dst host) don't agree<br class=3D"">about the =
internal structure of the varstore pflash.<br class=3D""><br =
