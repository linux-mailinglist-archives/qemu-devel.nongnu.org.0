Hi Paolo,

well, since it is one of my main objectives behind lots of the refactoring work I have in progress,
and have been announcing this to the list since May:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg04628.html

I would disagree with the fact that target-specific modules are a huge complication in by themselves, as I got some initial promising results in building them.

Will work on the series and contribute it as soon as the basic requisite initial refactoring series are in,
so that the usefulness of target-specific modules can be demonstrated.

In my view modules could have been implemented differently, instead of the current design, in a way that would have made them easier to extend.

Probably meson is an interesting tool, I think however that good build designs will still be necessary,
and that bad ones will still result in difficult to extend build features.

Thanks & ciao,

Claudio
