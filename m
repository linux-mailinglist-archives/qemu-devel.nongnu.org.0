The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to
another system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid
and which could be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to
"Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Cache Layout wrong on many Zen Arch CPUs

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  AMD CPUs have L3 cache per 2, 3 or 4 cores. Currently, TOPOEXT seems
  to always map Cache ass if it was an 4-Core per CCX CPU, which is
  incorrect, and costs upwards 30% performance (more realistically 10%)
  in L3 Cache Layout aware applications.

  Example on a 4-CCX CPU (1950X /w 8 Cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0=C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'8' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  In windows, coreinfo reports correctly:

  ****----  Unified Cache 1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----****  Unified Cache 6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  On a 3-CCX CPU (3960X /w 6 cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'6' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  in windows, coreinfo reports incorrectly:

  ****--  Unified Cache  1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----**  Unified Cache  6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  Validated against 3.0, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 versions of qemu-kvm.

  With newer Qemu there is a fix (that does behave correctly) in using the =
dies parameter:
  =C2=A0<qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D3,threads=3D1,dies=3D2,sockets=3D1'/>

  The problem is that the dies are exposed differently than how AMD does
  it natively, they are exposed to Windows as sockets, which means, that
  if you are nto a business user, you can't ever have a machine with
  more than two CCX (6 cores) as consumer versions of Windows only
  supports two sockets. (Should this be reported as a separate bug?)
