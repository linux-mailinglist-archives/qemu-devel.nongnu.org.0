If QEMU successfully starts then libvirt essentially ignores stderr
just letting it go to the logfile.

If we see any deprecated features used during startup the natural
thing would be to queue up a list of warnings, and then once the
client (libvirt) connects to QMP emit them as events.

QEMU still ought to emit them on stderr anyway so they do end up
in the logs regardless of whether anyone actually procsses the
deprecation QMP events.

Daniel
