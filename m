Oh OK.

Yes, thanks to Damien's work we can now use the Clock API to model
that correctly. This API is very recent, and very few devices use
it. We need to adapt them one by one.

I started with the serial:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg727975.html

I noticed in my projects is that the Clock API lacks something
like a FixedDividerClock. qdev_init_clock_in() expects a callback,
but with fixed divisor we could have the divisor in a state and
use a generic callback, but the callback doesn't take pointer to
state.

Maybe that can be a new field in NamedClockList. I didn't had time
to write patches tests and ping Damien/Peter about it, but will do
during Sept.

It makes sense but since (I guess) we could properly model that using
the Clock API, this hook is a temporary kludge...
I'm not against it however, since except this detail, this series is
almost perfect, and you already spent enough time.
IOW IMHO this kludge is acceptable for now, and modelling the missing
parts to use the Clock API can be done on top (or not...).

I haven't think of that limitation. I rather prefer we test the
original OpenBMC image. Simply disable the 3 longest services,
and we'll adjust the test time.

Thanks for the detailed info you provided.
