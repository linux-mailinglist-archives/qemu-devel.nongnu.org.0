displayed is the system you used this to generate. This would come handy es=
pecially later when you move from examples to actual reports. I think it'd =
make sense to add a section with a clear definition of the machine as well =
as the operation system, qemu version and eventually other deps (like compi=
ler, flags, ...). For this report something like:

Ahmed, I don't entirely agree with you on this topic.

I think you treated Mr. Lukas comments in an overly lax way.

Yes, the results will be stable (within a small fraction of a percent)
on a particular given system (which is proved in "Stability
Experiment" section of Report 1). That is great! Although it sounds
elementary, this is not easy to achieve, so I am glad you did it.

However, we know that the results for hosts of different architectures
will be different - we expect that.

32-bit Intel host will also most likely produce significantly
different results than 64-bit Intel hosts. By the way, 64-bit targets
in QEMU linux-user mode are not supported on 32-bit hosts (although
nothing stops the user to start corresponding instances of QEMU on a
32-bit host, but the results are unpredictable.

Let's focus now on Intel 64-bit hosts only. Richard, can you perhaps
enlighten us on whether QEMU (from the point of view of TCG target)
behaves differently on different Intel 64-bit hosts, and to what
degree?

I currently work remotely, but once I am be physically at my office I
will have a variety of hosts at the company, and would be happy to do
the comparison between them, wrt what you presented in Report 2.

In conclusion, I think a basic description of your test bed is missing
in your reports. And, for final reports (which we call "nightly
reports") a detailed system description, as Mr Lukas outlined, is,
also in my opinion, necessary.

Thanks, Mr. Lukas, for bringing this to our attention!

Yours,
Aleksandar
