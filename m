Well, Eduardo, nobody said that directory locations should be used for
enabling/disabling or tagging/untagging tests in the first place. I think
it was clear for everybody from the outset that these features should have
their own mechanisms, which Cleber says already exist, but can't be used
because the test group still can't figure out (in some hamletesque way)
whether to blacklist or to whitelist, or how to name the tag for travis,
and tag for not travis, and if such tags should even exist, etc. - that is
my layman impression from recent discussions. And now when Philippe
suggested (in my opinion logical and reasonable) subdirectory, an endless
discussion begins: =E2=80=9CTo subdirectory or not to subdirectory? That is=
 the
question.=E2=80=9D Meanwhile, 4.1 is inexorably getting closer and closer, =
and with
each day, the value of any potential tests is decreasing.

Directory structure should be used in its usual and basic way: for
clustering files of similar nature, purpose, or origin, and I do certainly
support any reasonable subdirectory organization for your directory - and
you should think about it, and probably while doing that consult a little
bit other people from all walks of QEMU. We are ready to comply with your
final decision.

The good thing is that nothing is set in stone, everything can be changed
and improved, moving files is easy in git.

All that said, many thanks for reviewing patch 4/4.
