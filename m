Make it more obvious how to add new fields to the version 3 header and
how to interpret them.

+The following fields of the header are optional: if software don't know how to

+This definition implies the following:
+1. Software may support some of these optional fields and ignore the others,

+2. Software may check @header_length, if it knows optional fields specification

+3. If @header_length is higher than the highest field end that software knows,

 Directly after the image header, optional sections called header extensions can
