The QAPI docs are in other manuals in docs/interop/, aren't they?

Right, and easier to review as well; I called it "the opposite
direction" because the editing is done in Texinfo format and the rST
conversion becomes relatively trivial.  This would make it possible to
do the conversion in a branch and pull it all at once (apart from
qapidoc and possibly other small changes like removing obsolete parts).

The automated conversion of qemu-deprecated.texi is indeed bad because
the titles in the source are missing @code{...} to activate monospaced
characters.

We probably don't want smartquotes at all, so you'd use "-t rst+smart"
as the destination.  Also pandoc does not use the "::" at the end of the
previous paragraph.  That can be fixed with for example

  perl -e '$/=undef; $_ = <>; s/:\n\n::/::/g; print'

In general the result is more than acceptable, and I'd rather get a
quick-and-slightly-dirty conversion done quickly than do everything
manually but risk missing 5.0.
