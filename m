Right, if we know that this is gluster.

Right, but again we don't know this is NFS.

Failing with EINVAL when using 1, and succeeding with another value is
considered
a successful detection.

We have 3 issues preventing detection:
- filesystem not using direct I/O on the remote server (NFS, Gluster when
network.remote-dio=on)
- area probed is unallocated with XFS or Gluster backed by XFS
- filesystem without buffer alignment requirement (e.g. Gluster)

For handling unallocated areas, we can:
- always allocate the first block when creating an image (qemu-img
create/convert)
- use write() instead of read().

In oVirt we went with the second option - when we initialize a file storage
domain, we create
a special file and do direct write to this file with 1, 512, and 4096 bytes
length. If we detect
512 or 4096, we use this value for creating the domain (e.g. for sanlock).
If we detect 1, we use the user provided value (default 512).

You can see the code here:
https://github.com/oVirt/vdsm/blob/4733018f9a719729242738b486906d3b9ed058cd/lib/vdsm/storage/fileSD.py#L838

One way we can use in qemu is to create a temporary file:

    /path/to/image.tmp9vo8US

Delete the file, keeping the fd open, and detect the alignment on this file
using write().

With this we fixed all the cases listed above, but creating new files
requires write permission
in the directory where the image is in, and will not work for some strange
setups
(.e.g bind-mount images).

One issue with this is that there is no guarantee that the temporary file
will be deleted so the
user will have to deal with leftover files.

With cases 2 and 3 this gives the desird result; however for cases 1 and

I'll try to make this more clear in v3.

This is better.

In fact, is checking bs->bl.request_alignment for 0 even worth it here?

Right, so we can:

    s->buf_align = (align != 1) ? align : bs->bl.request_alignment;

Thanks for reviewing.
