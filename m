From the fixing virt-v2v point of view, it's a bit tricky since the
code has to deal with all kinds of output targets.  (For example we
sometimes qemu-img convert into an NBD target.)

However we do know when the target contains zeroes - in fact it always
contains zeroes, so:

this one should work.
