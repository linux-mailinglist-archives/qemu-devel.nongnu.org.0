I can document concrete globals as replacement at the place
-mem-path/-mem-prealloc are documented during deprecation and
then in 2 releases we will just drop legacy syntax and keep only
globals over there.
(eventually it will spread various globals
over man page, which I don't like but we probably should start
somwhere and consolidate later if globals in man page become
normal practice.)
