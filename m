Yeah, the more I think about it, the more two callbacks still make 
sense.  .bdrv_make_empty may or may not need a flag, but .bdrv_make_zero 
definitely does (because that's where we want a difference between 
making the entire image zero no matter the delay, vs. only making it all 
zero if it is is fast).

The optimization I have in mind is adding a qcow2 autoclear bit to track 
when an image is known to read as all zero - at which point 
.bdrv_make_zero instantly returns success.  For raw files, a possible 
optimization is to truncate to size 0 and then back to the full size, 
when it is known that truncation forces read-as-zero.  For NBD, I'm 
still playing with whether adding new 64-bit transactions for a bulk 
zero will be useful, and even if not, maybe special-casing 
NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES with a size of 0 to do a bulk zero, if both server 
and client negotiated that particular meaning.
