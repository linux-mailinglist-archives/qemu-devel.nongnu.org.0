Today libvirt has no choice, because if there's an ABI compat
mistake in the dest QEMU config, vs the src QEMU config, then
when loading VMstate on the target, the dst QEMU will often be
unable to de-serialize the migration device stream and end
up printing an error on stderr and exiting. Getting that info
back to the src QEMU is impossible.

If QEMU had a bi-directional migration stream, then the dst
QEMU could simply send an error message back to the src QEMU
and 'query-migrate' could actually display this.

There may still be validation libvirt wants to do as well,
but at least there would be the possiblity of offloading
to QEMU without sacrificing error reporting.

With regards,
Daniel
