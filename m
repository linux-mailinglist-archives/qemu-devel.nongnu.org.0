- Add the '-noTSX' variants for CascadeLake and SkyLake.

- Document the three MSR bits: 'mds-no', 'taa-no', and 'tsx-ctrl'

  Two confusing things about 'mds-no' (and the first point applies to
  the other two MSRs too):

  (1) The 'mds-no' bit will _not_ show up in the guest's /proc/cpuinfo.
      Rather it is used to fill in the guest's sysfs:

        /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds:Not affected

      Paolo confirmed on IRC as such.

  (2) There are _three_ variants[+] of CascadeLake CPUs, with different
      stepping levels: 5, 6, and 7.  To quote wikichip.org[*]:

        "note that while steppings 6 & 7 are fully mitigated, earlier
        stepping 5 is not protected against MSBDS, MLPDS, nor MDSUM"

      The above is also indicated in the Intel's document[+], as
      indicated by "No" under the three columns of MFBDS, MSBDS, and
      MLPDS.

  I've expressed this in the docs without belabouring the details.

+  to any of the MDS variants ([MFBDS] CVE-2018-12130, [MLPDS]

+
+  This is an MSR (Model-Specific Register) feature rather than a CPUID fea=
ture,
+  so it will not appear in the Linux ``/proc/cpuinfo`` in the host or
+  guest.  Instead, the host kernel uses it to populate the MDS
+  vulnerability file in ``sysfs``.
+
+  So it should only be enabled for VMs if the host reports @code{Not
+  affected} in the ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds`` file.
+
+``taa-no``
+  Recommended to inform that the guest that the host is ``not``
+  vulnerable to CVE-2019-11135, TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA).
+
+  This too is an MSR feature, so it does not show up in the Linux
+  ``/proc/cpuinfo`` in the host or guest.
+
+  It should only be enabled for VMs if the host reports ``Not affected``

+
+``tsx-ctrl``
+  Recommended to inform the guest that it can disable the Intel TSX
+  (Transactional Synchronization Extensions) feature; or, if the
+  processor is vulnerable, use the Intel VERW instruction (a
+  processor-level instruction that performs checks on memory access) as
+  a mitigation for the TAA vulnerability.  (For details, refer to this
+  `Intel's deep-dive into
+  MDS <https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep=
-dive-intel-analysis-microarchitectural-data-sampling>`_.)
+
+  Expose this to the guest OS if and only if: (a) the host has TSX
+  enabled; *and* (b) the guest has ``rtm`` CPU flag enabled.
+
+  By disabling TSX, KVM-based guests can avoid paying the price of
+  mitigting TSX-based attacks.
+
+  Note that ``tsx-ctrl`` too is an MSR feature, so it does not show
+  up in the Linux ``/proc/cpuinfo`` in the host or guest.
+
+  To validate that Intel TSX is indeed disabled for the guest, there are
+  two ways: (a) check for the *absence* of ``rtm`` in the guest's
+  ``/proc/cpuinfo``; or (b) the
+  ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort`` file in
+  the guest should report ``Mitigation: TSX disabled``.
