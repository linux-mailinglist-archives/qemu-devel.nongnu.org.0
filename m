Again if a distro or users wants to use this feature in
QEMU they should be expected build the library.

QEMU doesn't support static linking for system emulators.  It may
happen to work at times but there's no expectations in this respect.

It looks like both CLang and GCC compilers for BPF are moving towards
a world where they use BTF to get compile once, run everywhere portability
for the compiled bytecode. IIUC the libbpf is what is responsible for
processing the BTF data when loading it into the running kernel. This
all looks like a good thing in general. 

If we introduce BPF to QEMU without using libbpf, and then later decide
we absolutely need libbpf features, it creates an upgrade back compat
issue for existing deployments. It is better to use libbpf right from
the start, so we're set up to take full advantage of what it offers
long term.

Daniel
