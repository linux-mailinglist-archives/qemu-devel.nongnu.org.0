Here's a QOM composition tree for the ARM virt machine (-nodefaults
-device e1000) as visible in qom-fuse under /machine, with irq and
qemu:memory-region ommitted for brevity:

    machine  virt-4.1-machine
      +-- fw_cfg  fw_cfg_mem
      +-- peripheral  container
      +-- peripheral-anon  container
      |     +-- device[0]  e1000
      +-- unattached  container
      |     +-- device[0]  cortex-a15-arm-cpu
      |     +-- device[1]  arm_gic
      |     +-- device[2]  arm-gicv2m
      |     +-- device[3]  pl011
      |     +-- device[4]  pl031
      |     +-- device[5]  gpex-pcihost
      |     |     +-- pcie.0  PCIE
      |     |     +-- gpex_root  gpex-root
      |     +-- device[6]  pl061
      |     +-- device[7]  gpio-key
      |     +-- device[8]  virtio-mmio
      |     |     +-- virtio-mmio-bus.0  virtio-mmio-bus
      |     .
      |     .  more virtio-mmio
      |     .
      |     +-- device[39]  virtio-mmio
      |     |     +-- virtio-mmio-bus.31  virtio-mmio-bus
      |     +-- device[40]  platform-bus-device
      |     +-- sysbus  System
      +-- virt.flash0  cfi.pflash01
      +-- virt.flash1  cfi.pflash01

Observations:

* Some components of the machine are direct children of machine: fw_cfg,
  virt.flash0, virt.flash1

* machine additionally has a few containers: peripheral,
  peripheral-anon, unattached.

* machine/peripheral and machine/peripheral-anon contain the -device
  with and without ID, respectively.

* machine/unattached contains everything else created by code without an
  explicit parent device.  Some (all?) of them should perhaps be direct
  children of machine instead.

Compare to the qdev tree shown by info qtree:

    bus: main-system-bus
      type System
      dev: platform-bus-device, id "platform-bus-device"
      dev: fw_cfg_mem, id ""
      dev: virtio-mmio, id ""
        bus: virtio-mmio-bus.31
          type virtio-mmio-bus
      ... more virtio-mmio
      dev: virtio-mmio, id ""
        bus: virtio-mmio-bus.0
          type virtio-mmio-bus
      dev: gpio-key, id ""
      dev: pl061, id ""
      dev: gpex-pcihost, id ""
        bus: pcie.0
          type PCIE
          dev: e1000, id ""
          dev: gpex-root, id ""
      dev: pl031, id ""
      dev: pl011, id ""
      dev: arm-gicv2m, id ""
      dev: arm_gic, id ""
      dev: cfi.pflash01, id ""
      dev: cfi.pflash01, id ""

Observations:

* Composition tree root machine's containers are not in the qtree.

* Composition tree node cortex-a15-arm-cpu is not in the qtree.  That's
  because it's not a qdev (in QOM parlance: not a TYPE_DEVICE).

* In the qtree, every other inner node is a qbus.  These are *leaves* in
  the composition tree.  The qtree's vertex from qbus to qdev is a
  *link* in the composition tree.

  Example: main-system-bus -> pl011 is
      machine/unattached/sysbus/child[4] ->
      ../../../machine/unattached/device[3].

  Example: main-system-bus/gpex-pcihost/pcie.0 -> e1000 is
      machine/unattached/device[5]/pcie.0//child[1] ->
      ../../../../machine/peripheral-anon/device[0].

Now let me ramble a bit on reset.

We could model the reset wiring explicitly: every QOM object that wants
to participate in reset has a reset input pin.  We represent the wiring
as links.  The reset links form a reset tree.

Example: object virt-4.1-machine at machine gets a link reset[4]
    pointing to its child object cfi.pflash01 at machine/virt.flash0.

Example: object PCIE at machine/unattached/device[5]/pcie.0 gets a link
    reset[1] pointing to object e1000 at
    machine/peripheral-anon/device[0].

    Note that reset[1] points to the same object as child[1].

Adding all these links in code would be tiresome.  Enter defaults.

If an object doesn't get its reset input connected, and

* the parent is machine/peripheral or machine/peripheral-anon, default
  to the object that links to it in the composition tree.  Error when
  there's more than one.

  Example: object e1000 at machine/peripheral-anon/device[0] defaults to
  machine/unattached/device[5]/pcie.0.

* the parent is machine/unattached, default to machine.

  Example: object gpex-pcihost at machine/unattached/device[5] defaults
  to machine.

* the parent is not one of these containers, default to its parent in
  the composition tree.

  Example: object cfi.pflash01 at machine/virt.flash0 defaults to
  machine.

This leaves the order in which an object asserts its reset wires
unspecified.  In physical hardware, these guys get asserted
simultaneously, and the various pieces of silicon at the other ends
reset in parallel.  In software, we serialize.

We could pick some order by numbering the reset links, say reset[0],
reset[1], ...

Reset could then work by walking the reset tree, running device model
callbacks before and after walking the children.

Cases may well exist where reset is more complicated than that.  Perhaps
an object resets its children in the reset tree at different times
during its own reset.  Such cases need to modelled in device model code.
That's another callback.

This is quite possibly too naive to be practical.  Hey, you asked :)
