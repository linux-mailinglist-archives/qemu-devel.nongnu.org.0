Yes, I think that's the same that I've used before. I assume it's the
relevant spec.

Yes, I think 1. is implemented correctly for PRDs that are too small and
smaller than a sector.

I think the assumption may have been that if the PRDT contains at least
one more full sector, we'll do that one sector before coming back to the
same place and hitting the code path for a too short PRDT.

However, the code neglects to actually use the return value of
.prepare_buf() to limit the number of sectors accessed. So if we ask for
a scatter/gather list for 5 sectors and we get 3 sectors, we still
assume we can write to all 5. This is obviously wrong.

I think for making the above assumption work, we'd have to check the
return value, which gets us something like:

    ret =3D s->bus->dma->ops->prepare_buf()
    if (ret < 512) {
        ... short PRDT code ...
    } else if (ret < n * 512) {
        n =3D ret / 512;
    }

Instead of doing the extra iteration and executing I/O for the first
part of the request, maybe this would work, too:

    ret =3D s->bus->dma->ops->prepare_buf()
    if (ret < n * 512) {
        ... short PRDT code ...
    }

We need to check in the spec whether we're supposed to actually do
partial I/O for short PRDTs. I couldn't find a clear answer with a quick
look, but I'm leaning towards doing the partial I/O (i.e. implementing
the first pseudo-code piece above).


As for handling long PRDTs, we have code that looks like it's meant to
handle the case:

    n =3D s->io_buffer_size >> 9;
    if (n > s->nsector) {
        /* The PRDs were longer than needed for this request. Shorten them =
so
         * we don't get a negative remainder. The Active bit must remain se=
t
         * after the request completes. */
        n =3D s->nsector;
        stay_active =3D true;
    }

bmdma_prepare_buf() does potentially set s->io_buffer_size to a value
larger than the passed limit, so maybe this is already correct. We have
a basic test for it in test_bmdma_long_prdt(), but I can't rule out that
there are more complicated cases where it fails.

I'm pretty sure we must handle the long PRDT case only after doing I/O
(like we currently do) because the operation is supposed to have
completed by the time we signal that the PRDT was long, so the guest can
trust that a read has actually read something and a write has reached
the disk. The spec says "This is a valid completion case".


Does this make sense to you?

Kevin
