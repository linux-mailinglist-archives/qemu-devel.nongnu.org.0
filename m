In
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-11/msg04646.html
it was suggested to move the comment around a bit.
I am not puzzled where and what I should say in the comment.
Can you (or other maintainers) kindly edit the comment for me?
I do not know enough about qemu to provide a good rationale here.

The patch changes a feature that lld does not support: -Ttext-segment,
to use --image-base instead.

Due to the prevalence of -z separate-code in GNU ld, -Ttext-segment is
no longer appropriate. I suggested that GNU linkers implement the
feature https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25207 .

What gets deleted is the sed script. As I explained in the commit
message, it is no longer relevant. It probably applies to an old GNU ld
that FreeBSD used. FreeBSD has switched to lld now.

I agree that --enable-pie will be a better solution, but dropping the
support now will break at least FreeBSD. Its kernel supports running an
ET_DYN executable but it does not perform address randomization.
--disable-pie also appears to be used by ChromeOS developers who
reported https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43997 . I can communicate
to them that migrating to --enable-pie is the way going forward.
