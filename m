Hello Daniel,

>There is no mention here of what VNC client program is being used, which
>is quite important, as key handling is a big mess in VNC.
I tested with TightVNC & noVNC through Apache. Both behaves the same. 
I did not tested Ultr@VNC.

Yes, I saw that topic passing by. Looks messy with all these interferences...

I guess I also crossed something about this on Internet.
Are you talking of the RFB protocol ?

So if I read you, if the client "enforce" this protocol (supposed 
RFB), Qemu will automatically uses it as well ?
Removing -k option is great to me if it works, since user will have 
its own mapping and these are international :-)

>To summarize, my recommendation is to remove the "-k" arg entirely,
>and pick a VNC client that supports the scancode extension.
For now I am using TightVNC & noVNC. noVNC is precious since it 
widens the user world, removing any client software constraint.

This was another path I intend to follow : using SPICE and a 
"noSPICE" client if VNC was too painful.
If I understand you, using SPICE could also solve the issue ?

Many thanks for your inputs...
