In Arm v8.0 M-profile CPUs without the Security Extension and also in
v7M CPUs, there is no NSACR register. However, the code we have to handle
the FPU does not always check whether the ARM_FEATURE_M_SECURITY bit
is set before testing whether env->v7m.nsacr permits access to the
FPU. This means that for a CPU with an FPU but without the Security
Extension we would always take a bogus fault when trying to stack
the FPU registers on an exception entry.

We could fix this by adding extra feature bit checks for all uses,
but it is simpler to just make the internal value of nsacr 0x3ff
("all non-secure accesses allowed"), since this is not guest
visible when the Security Extension is not present. This allows
us to continue to follow the Arm ARM pseudocode which takes a
similar approach. (In particular, in the v8.1 Arm ARM the register
is documented as reading as 0xcff in this configuration.)

I've marked this as for-4.1 because support for M-profile FPU
is new in this release and this is a pretty bad bug for it.
It probably doesn't qualify as so bad we need an rc4 but I
think we need an rc4 anyway and it probably does merit putting
in at that point.
