Generally, when running spatch, you want to include --macro-file=20
scripts/cocci-macro-file.h to help coccinelle get past the worst of the=20
preprocessor macros it can't otherwise handle.  But that is rather sad=20
that it ignores the entire function body as soon as it encounters a=20
parse problem, and also sad that scripts/cocci-macro-file.h isn't yet=20
complete enough to help coccinelle past the QSIMPLEQ_HEAD() uses in our=20
sources.  (I wonder how many other false negatives we have where we=20
missed a code cleanup because Coccinelle silently gave up on parsing a=20
function or file)

Eww - that sounds like a Coccinelle bug that we should report to their=20
upstream.

We may not need to parse all our headers, if the --macro-file=20
scripts/cocci-macro-file.h is sufficient.

In fact, now that I found that (by reading through git log history of=20
previous Coccinelle scripts we've run), and adding the proper=20
--macro-file command line argument, I didn't have to add a=20
--recursive-includes, but Coccinelle was finally able to fix that last=20
spot in block/qcow2-bitmap.c.

Using --macro-file sscripts/cocci-macro-file.h should get it a lot=20
further.  The sad part is I don't have a quantitative way to tell how=20
many functions/files are being silently skipped when Coccinelle runs up=20
against something it doesn't know how to parse.

A little more blunt (and as written, not idempotent), but as long as we=20
document whatever pattern we use (whether coccinelle or regex) and the=20
patch is repeatable, that's less of a concern.
