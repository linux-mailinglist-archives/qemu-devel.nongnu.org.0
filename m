True, if we don=E2=80=99t think an extension will be required in the =
future we might
as well call it =E2=80=9Clchs" or "bios-geometry=E2=80=9D.

I=E2=80=99m not sure about this but if =E2=80=9Cbootorder=E2=80=9D was =
written in the first place using
such an extension this could have been useful.
I don=E2=80=99t have anything specific in mind.
I don=E2=80=99t think deprecating bootorder is useful either, just =
mentioned that it
will be possible if we would like to unify all disk values someday.

Well for lchs (A) a non-existing value is 0, 0, 0 (uint32).
So at the moment we=E2=80=99re good.
We can signal other values with other magic numbers (such as -1 for =
bootorder)
or prefix the value with an additional boolean value =E2=80=9Cis =
signaled=E2=80=9D.

Only making this available in non-legacy mode.
Qemu complains in get_fw_cfg_order() (fw_cfg.c):

	warn_report("Unknown firmware file in legacy mode: %s", name);

Detected during qtests.


So overall, WDYT?
Keep it extendible for a low price of ABI + =E2=80=9Cbootdevices=E2=80=9D =
name.
Or go strict and rename to =E2=80=9Cbios-geometries=E2=80=9D?

(The ABI will not change too much anyway, the struct_size will disappear
and sizeof(12) struct of LCHS will be assumed)
