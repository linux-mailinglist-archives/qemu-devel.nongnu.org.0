We could, but I don't find the cost/benefit tradeoff is compelling.

There are so many places where we diverge from what bare metal would
do, that I don't see a good reason to introduce this breakage, even
if we notify users via a deprecation message. 

If QEMU wants to require NUMA for EPYC, then QEMU could internally
create a single NUMA node if none was specified for new machine
types, such that there is no visible change or breakage to any
mgmt apps.
