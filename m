But currently, each of the container stages currently takes > 2 minutes, 
even with the cached containers. I had a quick look, and it takes 7 
minutes 'till the "build" stage begins. So all the advantages of not 
having to do "yum/apt-get install" in the build containers anymore seem 
to be crushed by the time that the three container stages take now?
