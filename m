OK, I agree it doesn't make much difference to the user whether the error
hint is the generic "sve256 required with sve512" verse

 sve256=off,sve512=on  "cannot enable sve512 with sve256 disabled"

or

 sve512=on,sve256=off  "cannot disable sve256 with sve512 enabled"

And disable uninitialized bits in sve_vq_map from OFF bits: auto-disabling

Also we can't do these populate uninitialized bits from on/off steps when
KVM is enabled without first getting the kvm-supported map.

I wouldn't always do this. If the user explicitly sets a maximum with
sve-max-vq, then we should generate errors when other inputs would change
that maximum. I would only assert they're the same when both input types
are provided. Of course we do the above when only map input is provided
though.

Ah, the ol' I'll do it if you don't motivator... I do see some
potential for a reduction in complexity with this approach, but
I'm not sure we'll save many lines of code. I could do a quick
hack on top of this series, just to see how well the validator
function looks and works, but I can't get to it until midweek
next week. I won't complain if you beat me to it :-)

Thanks,
