It's not clear what should happen going forward. Let's say version is
incremented again. This then becomes challenging for downstreams to
backport.

I just dislike versions, they are hard to maintain.

Individual ones is cleanest imho. Self-documenting.
But if not, I'd do something like "x-vmport-fixes" and
set bits there for each bugfix.

Well that at least is easy to google.

=09.vmx

=09<vmname>.vmx

=09This is the primary configuration file, which stores settings
=09chosen in the New Virtual Machine Wizard or virtual machine settings
=09editor. If you created the virtual machine under an earlier version of
=09VMware Workstation on a Linux host, this file may have a .cfg extension

so .vmx as used here has nothing to do with VM Executable version or
type. Looks like it's just a source of confusion on the vmware
side too :)

Well you said that's what it stands for. I have no idea.  From what you
say now maybe vmx basically is being used as a prefix for all things
vmware. In that case vmport-version and vmport-type or even
vmware-version and vmware-type will do just as well.

I'm just saying don't use vmx. It's too late to try to give
it a different meaning. Figure out what it's supposed to
stand for and write it out in full.
