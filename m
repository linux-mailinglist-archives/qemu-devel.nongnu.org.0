So far it produces warning in linux kernel (RHBZ1728166),
(resulting performance might be suboptimal), but I haven't seen
anyone reporting crashes yet.


What other options do we have?
Perhaps we can turn on strict check for new machine types only,
so old configs can keep broken topology (CPUID),
while new ones would require -numa and produce correct topology.
