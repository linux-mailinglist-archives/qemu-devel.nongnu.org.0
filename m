Urgh.. not really.. it was spread out over several discussions, some
of which were on IRC or Slack, rather than email.

Hrm, I see your point.  So... I guess my thinking is that although the
strict meaning of the proposed host-trust-limitation option is just
that "protection _can_ be used, at the guest/platform's option", it is
a strong hint that we're expecting protection to be used.

So would this work for s390:
  * The cpu feature remains, as now, enabled by default
  * The host-trust-limitation option would apply the protection
    necessary virtio options (and any other changes to defaults we
    discover we need), just as it does for SEV and POWER PEF
  * Optionally, the s390 machine type code could error out if
    host-trust-limitation is specified, but the cpu option is
    explicitly disabled

Right.. IIUC you're suggesting delaying finalization of the device's
featureset until the guest driver actually starts probing it

So, I don't know what the situation is with z, but for POWER machines
with the ultravisor running are rare (read, not actually available
outside IBM yet), and not directly tied to a cpu version (obviously
you need a cpu with support, but you also need to actually be running
under an ultravisor, which is optional).  So what are our options:

1) Require explicitly enabling PEF support - this is burdening the
   user, as you say, but..

2) Allow by default - but fail if the host doesn't have support.  That
   means explicitly *disabling* on non-ultravisor machines, a much
   bigger imposition on the user

3) Enable conditionally depending on host support.  Seems nice, but
   it's badly broken, as we've found with previous times we've tried
   to automatically do things based on host capabilities.  The problem
   is that once you have this, it's not obvious without knowing a
   bunch about the hosts which ones it will be safe to migrate
   between.  That horribly breaks things like RHV that want to do load
   balancing migrations within a cluster

Basically having different guest-visible features depending on host
properties is just unworkable, which brings us back to (1) being the
least bad option.
