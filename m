Yeah, you are right ;-)

But after I tested old path yesterday, I found that the num_dirty_pages_period
becomes total ram size after log sync in ram_init_bitmaps. The reason is that
bitmap of ramblock is initialized to be all set, so old path counts them as dirty
by mistake.

This bug causes false positive throttling at the end of first ram save iteration,
even without our DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_ALL_SET feature.
