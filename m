I would have to think a bit more about it, but it does sound safer.

Or we take a step back and ask why it's even a problem for the mirror
block job if the BlockBackend is moved to a different node. The main
reason I see is because of bs->job that is set for the root node of the
BlockBackend and needs to be unset for the same node.

Maybe we can just finally get rid of bs->job? It doesn't have many users
any more.
