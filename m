Sorry but I don't believe this until I see it.  The two APIs are just 
too different.  And at some point the complexity of DEFINE_PROP becomes:

1) harder to document

2) just as hard to parse and build a QAPI schema from

And in the final desired result where QAPI generators are what generates 
the list of properties, it's pointless to shoehorn both kinds of 
properties in the same array if different things can just generate 
calls to different functions.

Out of 700 calls to object_class_property_add*, there are maybe 5 that 
are dynamic.  So on one hand I understand why you want an API that makes 
those things harder, but on the other hand I don't see such a big risk 
of misuse, and it won't even matter at all if we later end up with 
properties described in a QAPI schema.

It would have to use all the Visitor crap and would be even harder to 
use than object_class_property_add_str.  Thanks but no thanks. :)

I don't see how

     if (...) {
         object_class_add_field_properties(oc, props);
     }

is discouraged any more than

     if (...) {
         object_class_add_field_property(oc, "prop1",
                                         PROP_STRING(...));
         object_class_add_field_property(oc, "prop2",
                                         PROP_STRING(...));
         object_class_add_field_property(oc, "prop3",
                                         PROP_STRING(...));
         object_class_add_field_property(oc, "prop4",
                                         PROP_STRING(...));
     }

(If anything, the former is more natural and less ugly than the latter).

I agree.  I just don't think that arrays are enough to make sure the 
same problems won't happen again.

The problem with those code paths is that there's a reason why they look 
like they do.  For x86_cpu_register_feature_bit_props, for example 
either you introduce duplication between QOM property definitions and 
feat_names array, or you resort to run-time logic like that.

If you want to make those properties introspectable (i.e. known at 
compilation time) you wouldn't anyway use DEFINE_PROP*, because it would 
cause duplication.  Instead, you could have a plug-in parser for 
qapi-gen, reading files akin to target/s390x/cpu_features_def.h.inc. 
The parser would generate both QAPI schema and calls to 
x86_cpu_register_bit_prop().

To sum up: for users where properties are heavily dependent on run-time 
logic, the solution doesn't come from providing a more limited API.  A 
crippled API will simply not solve the problem that prompted the usage 
of run-time logic, and therefore won't be used.

(I don't know enough of the ARM case to say something meaningful about it).

You want to remove hiding behind a function call, but why is it any 
better to hide behind layers of macros?  Just the example you had in 
your email included DEFINE_PROP, DEFINE_FIELD_PROP, DEFINE_PROP_UINT32. 
  It's still impossible to figure out without either parsing or 
executing C code.
