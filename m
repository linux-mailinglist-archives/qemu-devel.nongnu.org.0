I just spoke with Andrea, who is doing the libvirt side of this, about
this behavior. He suggests that we change it such that an error is
generated if sve=off and there are explicitly enabled vector lengths,
e.g. '-cpu max,sve=off,sve256=on' should generate an error. It would
still be possible to have sve<N>=on and sve=off on the same command
line, as long as the sve<N>=on is followed by sve<N>=off, like this
-cpu max,sve=off,sve256=on,sve256=off,sve128=off, but I don't think
we need to worry about that sort of thing. I'll add an error for
the non-empty vector length map with SVE off case for v5.

Thanks,
drew
