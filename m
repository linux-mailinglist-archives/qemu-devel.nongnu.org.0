"edge-triggered INTx" is not a thing that exists.  The PCI spec defines
interrupt pins as:

  2.2.6. Interrupt Pins (Optional)

  Interrupts on PCI are optional and defined as "level sensitive,"
  asserted low (negative true), using open drain output drivers.

Masking of interrupts while they're in-service is not done for edge
triggered interrupts, we assume that being a discrete interrupt is a
sufficient rate limiter versus a level triggered interrupt, which is
continuous and can saturate the host.

If it exists before the level check only to match the kernel, maybe a
comment or todo item to check whether it's the optimal approach for
both cases should be in order.  I can't think of any reason why we'd
need it for the sake of edge triggered vfio interrupts in either place.
Thanks,

Alex
