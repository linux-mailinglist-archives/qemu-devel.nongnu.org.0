Correct!  As discussed at the QEMU summit, we'll gladly chip in runners
to test the stuff we care about, but to match the coverage of your
private zoo of machines, others will have to chip in, too.

Makes sense to me.

Next steps to get this off the ground:

* Red Hat provides runner(s) for x86 stuff we care about.

* If that doesn't cover 'basic "x86 configs" in your judgement, we
  fill the gaps as described below under "Expand from there".

* Add an s390 runner using the project machine you mentioned.

* Expand from there: identify the remaining gaps, map them to people /
  organizations interested in them, and solicit contributions from these
  guys.

A note on contributions: we need both hardware and people.  By people I
mean maintainers for the infrastructure, the tools and all the runners.
Cleber & team are willing to serve for the infrastructure, the tools and
the Red Hat runners.

Does this sound workable?

Understand.  We need contributions to gating CI, but the whole point of
this exercise is to make people other than *you* contribute to our
gating CI :)

Let me use this opportunity to say thank you for all your integration
work!
