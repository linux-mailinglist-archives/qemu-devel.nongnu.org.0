The 'keymaps' directory contents is nothing to do with the firmware
blobs. The 'pc-bios/keymaps' directory appears to have been used
previously as a convenience for getting the files installed into
a subdir of the firmware install dir. This install time arrangement
does not need to be reflected in the source tree arrangement. These
keymaps logically belong with the UI code.
