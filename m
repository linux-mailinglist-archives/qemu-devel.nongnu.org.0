Hi Sam,

The QEMU series is still not merged, due to a bug in the last patch
(namely, the test case, "hd-geo-test: Add tests for lchs override").

To my knowledge, SeaBIOS prefers to merge patches with the underlying
QEMU patches merged first, so you'll likely have to fix that QEMU issue
first.

I explained the bug in the QEMU test case here:

)

I've never received feedback to those messages, and I think you must
have missed them.

FWIW, when I hit "Reply All" in that thread, you were on the "To:" list
with:

  Sam Eiderman <shmuel.eiderman@oracle.com>

but here you are present with

  Sam Eiderman <sameid@google.com>

In addition, when I posted those messages, I got the following
auto-response ("Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender"):

I didn't know your new address, so I could only hope you'd find my
feedback on qemu-devel.

Thanks
