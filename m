I expect both cases need supporting.

In the case of distro builds, they will have to fetch the
deps ahead of time, because the build environments usually
won't have any network access. Some contributors have also
previously objected to the build system fetching stuff off
the network, but they're a small minority.

For friendliness to developers, the build process would be
best to fetch automatically, if they haven't been provided
upfront.

It is probably even more compelling when looking at SLES, which is
having an even larger gap between releases than RHEL does.

With regards,
