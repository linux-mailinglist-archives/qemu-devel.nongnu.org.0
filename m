Really?  I believe it was slightly earlier in the same series:

93b91c59db qemu-ga: switch to the new error format on the wire
de253f1491 qmp: switch to the new error format on the wire

The commit you mention (df1e608a01e) is merely follow-up simplification.

Why do you need to distinguish CommandNotFound from CommandDisabled?
