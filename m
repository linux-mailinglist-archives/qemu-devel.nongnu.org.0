Thanks a lot for your careful analysis.

I got scared the uh-oh you raised would get this series or rework of it
still refused for the release, so I went for a quick-and-dirty bugfix.
Since this bugfix got merged (as commit 3a283507c0347), I can now think
again about how to properly fix this (if it is fixable...).

Well it depends where you stand.

I have a few patches on top of this adding trace events (4.2 material)
and while debugging it was not making sense with the CFI specs.

1/ The guest writes 0xFF to go in READ_ARRAY mode, the model report a
warning and take the switch default case which calls pflash_reset(),
which happens to set the flash in READ_ARRAY.

2/ Then a later series adds the CFI specs timings (like the CFI02
model), because it would useful to test the UEFI Capsule Update feature
with real-time behavior. For the 'Virt' pflash, the timing is disabled.
Now running a non-Virt pflash, it becomes very slow because each time
the guest goes into READ_ARRAY mode, the reset delay (which is the
longest) occurs.

Talking with Laszlo, I figured for 1/ instead of fixing the model, I can
display 0x00 as 0xFF and ignore the pflash_reset() when the caller is
not system_reset(). Dirty again.

For 2/ it is not that easy, it will depends if there is more interest
from the UEFI community (Intel parallel NOR flashes are used on x86 and
aarch64 UEFI platforms).

If we justify 1/ and 2/ are not important, then it is simply a cleanup.

0x00 is not in the spec (but as suggested Peter Maydell, the spec can
eventually assign the value in the future [*]). So no guests use it.
This value is only set:
- when the (old) model is initialized, without any access to the guest
- if the guest wrote an incorrect value, hitting the switch default case.
The guest can not read this value (value internal to the state machine).

So answer: Yes :(

[*] However the spec has a way to announce supported features to the guest.

I understand the full question as "Can @cmd ever be 0xFF [in Old] before
this patch?".

Answer: No, neither the guest nor the state machine can set @cmd to 0xFF
in Old.

>>>
>>>   New -> old -> new leaves 0xFF unchanged.  Good.  It changes 0x00 to
>>>   0xFF.  Same uh-oh as for new -> new.

"Same uh-oh", do you mean "Can @cmd ever be 0x00 [in New] before this
patch?"?

Same answer: No, neither the guest nor the state machine can set @cmd to
0x00 in New.

>>> On 0xFF, we no longer zap pfl->wcycle and pfl->cmd.

We have 2 ways to set @cmd=0xFF.

- Write 0xFF, write an invalid command,
  finish a multicycle operation (wcycle returns to 0):

  pflash_write() goto reset_flash, then calls
  memory_region_rom_device_set_romd(). set wcycle=0, cmd=READ_ARRAY.

  Next read() will be in ROMD mode, we won't reach pflash_read().

  - if next access is write, we'll enter the same pflash_write().

- The /* This should never happen */ comment in pflash_read().

  It might happens migrating? So we migrated crap, the guest wants to
  read, the crap defaults to READ_ARRAY in I/O mode. Wrong in many ways,
  not sure what the guest expects there, probably not ARRAY data.
  Anyway, we stay in this READ_ARRAY I/O mode until the guest eventually
  does a write access. Wrong.

The case "The state machine set 0xff, let the device in I/O mode" so we
expect to answer to a read() with READ_ARRAY is wrong too, the device
should already be in ROMD mode.

This could happen if the the guest is writing crap, so we correctly
