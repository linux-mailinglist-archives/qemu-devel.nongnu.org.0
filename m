I guess everything should be in balance, but I understand very well
what you mean.

Yea, but the point is that it makes it harder to test new features,
that slightly change the output of the tests, and break various tests tha=
t hardcode unneeded things.

Pretty much exactly what this patch series does,=20
is to remove some of the ad-hoc stuff to make the
tests work with a new feature.=20

A bit more generic tests, might be able
to reduce this work. Anyway I won't argue with this as well, its all matt=
er of
balance, both extremes are no doubt bad.

100% agree.=20
