Yes.

From an explicit software test. If I initialize kvm_target to
KVM_ARM_TARGET_GENERIC_V8, I can certainly run EDK2.

That's what I thought until I saw the manual A57/A53 setting of
kvm_target.

I don't really.

Right. But then I got somewhat confused also by how
https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=target/arm/kvm64.c#l494
doesn't explicitly list KVM_ARM_TARGET_CORTEX_A53.

So ... the reason I care is because I'm adding a new cpu in my local
branch, figured cpu64.c was a good starting point, and then followed a
long string of repeating the questions "why?" and "why not?" while
trying to understand why things were set up the way they are.

And I ended up in a state where it looks like we do some things for
A57 that we don't do for A53, and we do even fewer things for A72, but
then we do (end up doing) all of the A57 bits again for max (for TCG
only), and then overwriting them.

Then I tried to build some sort of consistent working model in my head
and send some questions off to the list rather than try to send out
patches straight away as I figured the likelihood was high I had
missed or misunderstood something.

I guess what I'm really asking is if there is some legacy in here
that can be cleaned up to make the expected behaviour for a new CPU
more clear from looking at available code? And if there are specific
legacy things that need to be kept around for compatibility that
should not be implemented by new CPUs, if they could have some nice
warnings attached.

Regards,

Leif
