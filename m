No, there is not a directly dependency relation between writing MISA and 
profile extension.
I think we have too many places for configuring the extensions ( ISA or 
Non-ISA) and we don't have a unified check function.

For example:

1) The cpu init function.

2) The -cpu property

3) wite_misa

And if supported,  the profile will be converted into the combination of 
extensions in cfg. It will add a new configuration point.
Thus I think we should unify the check function before introduce the 
more configuration place.

My initial idea is that we always use the cfg fields for configuration 
and misa is only a mapping of combination cfg fields. And the unified 
check function
only works on cfg field.

And of course,  you can omit this comment for this patch set.
