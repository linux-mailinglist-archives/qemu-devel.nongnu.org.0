That makes sense to me.  I don't know if other possible users of the
mechanism have different opinions though.

Hm, I see.  It feels like just ignoring underflow is ignoring the
error rather than really addressing it.  When we add a device to the
heirarchy, do we need to initialize its reset count based on its
parent's current count or something.

Uh... migration is only permitted between identical machines.  I don't
see how a new device is possible.

> >> + * The base class implementation of the interface provides this
> >> + * state and implements the associated method: get_state.
> >> + *
> >> + * Concrete object implementations (typically specific devices
> >> + * such as a UART model) should provide the functions
> >> + * for the phases.init, phases.hold and phases.exit methods, which
> >> + * they can set in their class init function, either directly or
> >> + * by calling resettable_class_set_parent_phases().
> >> + * The phase methods are guaranteed to only only ever be called once
> >> + * for any reset event, in the order 'init', 'hold', 'exit'.
> >> + * An object will always move quickly from 'init' to 'hold'
> >> + * but might remain in 'hold' for an arbitrary period of time
> >> + * before eventually reset is deasserted and the 'exit' phase is call=
ed.
> >> + * Object implementations should be prepared for functions handling
> >> + * inbound connections from other devices (such as qemu_irq handler
> >> + * functions) to be called at any point during reset after their
> >> + * 'init' method has been called.
> >> + *
> >> + * Users of a resettable object should not call these methods
> >> + * directly, but instead use the function resettable_reset().
> >> + *
> >> + * @phases.init: This phase is called when the object enters reset. It
> >> + * should reset local state of the object, but it must not do anythin=
g that
> >> + * has a side-effect on other objects, such as raising or lowering a =

> >> + * line or reading or writing guest memory. It takes the reset's type=

 called.

> >> + *
> >> + * @phases.exit: This phase is called when the object leaves the rese=
