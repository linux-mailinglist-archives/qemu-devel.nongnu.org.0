I can simplify to two:

  trace_vhost_section(mr->name)
  trace_vhost_reject_section(mr->name, int reason)

Not sure if it's worth defining a enum outside just for the purposes of
the trace though. Do we have the concept of per-trace event enum codes?

So can vhost interfere with dirty tracking itself in the kernel by
trapping the writes? I guess there is no way this can happen with
vhost-user?

(I wonder what would happen if a vhost-user daemon did an mprotect() on
RAM from it's shared view?)

We use it softmmu do any pages that have code in them always force the
slow-path into cputlb for writes to those pages. This allows us to
detect self-modifying code. The kernel would never get involved but I
don't think vhost and TCG is compatible anyway. I'm only really
interested in vhost-user and it's interaction with TCG.

I'll spin a v2 now.
