Sounds good to me.

Yeah, I'm not really worried about blkverify per se. It just seems like
an interesting corner case to discuss to make sure that the design of
the role system is right and doesn't miss anything important.

The example of a caching driver that uses a child node for the cached
data (probably on a fast, but small disk) was what made me answer the
question with "no".

But as you write, having a pure metadata child could make sense, too.
