docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt has the same problem: it's mostly internal
stuff, but there's also introspection, which is an external interface.

For a value of "rigorous".

Let me propose QAPI's query-qmp-schema as the tin standard[*] of
introspection:

* It's documented

* It comes with something that can pass as a type system

* It actually tells you the full truth.

Now compare to QOM:

* Documentation

  QAPI: docs/devel/qapi-code-gen.txt section "Client JSON Protocol
  introspection"

  QOM: Nada

* Type system

  QAPI: A few built-in types specified in the documentation, type
  constructors for complex types.

  QOM: Types are strings, and you just need to know what they mean.
  Some string patterns are special: link<STR>, child<STR>, STR[INT], and
  you just need to know what that means, too.

* Full truth

  QAPI: If you can access it at the interface, you can also see it in
  introspection.

  QOM: Type introspection can show you only the properties of a freshly
  created object.  Properties that get created only later are invisible.
  Properties that depend on global state are unreliable.  Object
  introspection is reliable, but only for that object in its current
  state.
