I don't like this. This adds two via-ide specific data to to common PCI 
IDE code where it does not belong and subclassing it just for this also 
seems to be more changes than really needed. Reusing the existing CMD646 
field and generalising it to allow implementation specific feature flags 
seems much less intrusive and not less clean than your proposal.

How do I connect gpios to 8259 interrupts? That seems to be internal 
state of 8259 that I'm not sure how to access cleanly from code 
instantiating it. Is this better than my patch? It seems it achieves the 
same via-ide specific behaviour just in a more complicated way and would 
still need the feature bit to know when to use legacy_irq[1].

According to the 8231 datasheet in legacy mode (and on pegasos2's 
half-native mode) the interrupts should be 14 and 15 so legacy_irq[n] with 
your way but in 100% native mode (used on the fulong2e) it should be the 
one set in PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE. The 686B datasheet does not detail this but 
I believe it works the same. Since we currently fixed the native mode 
interrupt to 14 to work around pegasos2 firmware and QEMU PCI reset 
interactions using legacy_irq[0] might work but is not correct, the 
current way using PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE is better modelling what hardware 
does in my opinion.

Before I spend time modifying this patch I'd really like to hear what John 
as the IDE maintainer prefers for this. John could you chime in and share 
your views please?
