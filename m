Looks good to me.

Btw, IIUC scheme 1 can also be seen as a way to buffer the duplicated pages in
RAM.  If that's the case, another implementation (even if we want to implement
that in the future, but I still doubt it...) is to grant tuables to the current
migration channel to take more pages in the buffer cache.  Currently, the
migration channel does buffering in QEMUFile.buf[IO_BUF_SIZE], where
IO_BUF_SIZE is 32K as constant.

Anyway, we can start with the simple scheme.

Thanks!
