Just to make sure I didn't misunderstand - do you want to tell the guest
precisely where the buffers are, like "address X is the used ring, address
Y is the descriptor table", or do you want to specify a range of memory
where the guest can allocate DMA buffers, in no specific order, for a
given device?  So far I've assumed we're talking about the latter.

Virtio-iommu could describe which bits of guest-physical memory is
available for DMA for a given device. It already provides a mechanism for
describing per-device memory properties (the PROBE request) which is
extensible. And I think the virtio-iommu device could be used exclusively
for this, too, by having DMA bypass the VA->PA translation
(VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS) and only enforcing guest-physical boundaries. Or
just describe the memory and not enforce anything.

I don't know how to plug this into the DMA layer of a Linux guest, though,
but there seems to exist a per-device DMA pool infrastructure. Have you
looked at rproc_add_virtio_dev()?  It seems to allocates a specific DMA
region per device, from a "memory-region" device-tree property, so perhaps
you could simply reuse this.

Thanks,
Jean
