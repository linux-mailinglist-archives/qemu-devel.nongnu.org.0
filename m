I was not thinking about the sysfs interface, but rather about the data
that is sent over while migrating. E.g. we find out that sending some
auxiliary data is a good idea and bump to version 1.1.0; version 1.0.0
cannot deal with the extra data, but version 1.1.0 can deal with the
older data stream.

In the end, the mdev type is represented as a string; but I'm not sure
we can expect that two types with the same name, but a different
device_api are related in any way.

If we e.g. compare vfio-pci and vfio-ccw, they are fundamentally
different.

I was mostly concerned about the aggregation proposal, where type A +
aggregation value b might be compatible with type B + aggregation value
a.

FWIW, I'm for a strict match on mdev type, and flexibility in per-type
attributes.

Yes, I'm not sure how to deal with the "same thing for different
vendors" problem. We can try to make sure that in-kernel drivers play
nicely, but not much more.
