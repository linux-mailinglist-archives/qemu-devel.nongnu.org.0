Avi,

Something I have realized we missed as a feedback here - or maybe I
missed checking previous comments - is how your mouse is being setup for
the guest. Is it being PS/2 emulated (default) or is it being given as
an USB device (when qemu cmd line has "-usb -device usb-tablet"). Also,
are you using SPICE protocol (perhaps with USB direction option ?).

Are you able to tell which xserver-xorg-input-XX module is being used
inside the guest ? You will probably find that information from Xorg log
files (check if you're using xf86-input-wacom or xserver-xorg-input-
evdev or some other).

Another thing that comes to my mind as well, are you using powersaving
features ? Specifically the I2C bus I'm concerned. Using "powertop", you
are able to change "Runtime PM for I2C Adapter" option under the
Tunables Tab (turning the power mgmt to off). I would like to know if
you are able to reproduce the issue without having power management
enabled for I2C. You can try disabling only I2C and then disabling all
PM options as a second attempt.

>From your host:

Could you describe your input devices ? How many mice, trackpads, pens,
etc, you are using connected to the host ?

Thanks! And sorry for so many questions =3D).

Title:
  QEMU touchpad input erratic after wakeup from sleep

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete
Status in libvirt package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Using Ubuntu host and guest. Normally the touchpad works great. Within
  the last few days, suddenly, apparently after a wake from sleep, the
  touchpad will behave erratically. For example, it will take two clicks
  to select something, and when moving the cursor it will act as though
  it is dragging even with the button not clicked.

  A reboot fixes the issue temporarily.
