I do understand this and all looks logical what you have said.

Yes, there is a reason for this (but not sure if that is
convincing enough) but having an added flag at per-machine level
will help in supporting ARM VCPU Hotplug feature I am dealing with.

Just a summary to give you a context of vcpu hotplug design:

As per the design, at the time of machvirt_init() we pre-create
the ARMCPU objects along with the corresponding KVM vcpus at the
host. KVM vcpu initialized context(struct kvm_parked_vcpus) for the
disabled vcpus is parked at per VM list kvm_parked_vcpus.=20

We create the ARMCPU objects(but these are not *realized* in qdev
sense) to facilitate the GIC initialization (pre-sized with possible
vcpus) with minimum change. After Initialization of the machine is
complete we release the ARMCPU Objects for the disabled vcpus(which
shall be re-created at the time when vcpu is hot plugged and
at that time we re-attach this new ARMCPU object with already
parked KVM VCPU context).=20

So we have few options related to ARMCPU object release:
1. The ARMCPU objects for the disabled vcpus are released in
   context to the virt_machine_done() notifier.=20
2. Defer release till a new vcpu object is hot plugged.
3. Never release and keep on reusing them and release once
   at VM exit.

Each of the above approaches come with  their own pros and cons.
(And I have prototyped each)

1st case looks more cleaner but the only problem we are facing
is after ARMCPUs are released and later during UEFI takes over,
it could again call the QEMU virt_acpi_build_update() to update
the ACPI tables(which UEFI has patched) which further ends up in
build_dsdt()->build_madt() path and leads to a problem since
disabled ARMCPU object are not available as they were released
earlier in context of virt_machine_done().=20

The problem happens in MADT which  needs per-vcpu PMU feature
check  to decide whether to enable it in the GICC MDAT entry.

Perhaps the problem is that maybe we are going against some
design expectations and we should not be releasing the ARMCPU
at all as firmware is dependent on it. And maybe UEFI and QEMU
have some sort of coupled design which does not helps.

No, I am not rather assuming identical/homogenous processing.

It is not exactly a problem and as you said a rather pointless check
present. But as explained I was trying to check if we could have
a per-machine flag to devise a workaround for the PMU for now and have
the design(above 3 approaches discussed) of the vcpu hotplug discussed
as part of the patches which I have almost prepared.

(Maybe I should float the ARM VCPU Hotplug patches and let this
 discussion be held over there?)

Many thanks,
Salil.
