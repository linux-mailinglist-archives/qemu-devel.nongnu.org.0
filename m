Hi David,

Thanks for cc me, it was really exciting to know that write-protect feature=
 finally been merged.
Exclude live memory snapshot, I'm thinking if we can use it to realize the =
real memory throttle in migration,
Since we still can come across dirty pages fail to converge with current cp=
u throttle method.
we may use write-protect capability to slow down the accessing speed of gue=
st's memory, in order to
slow down the dirty pages ..., I'll look into it.

Besides, I'll follow this snapshot series, and to see if I can do some work=
s to make this feature to be perfect enough
To be accepted as quickly as possible. ;)


Thanks,
Hailiang
