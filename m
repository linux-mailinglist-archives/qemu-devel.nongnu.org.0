Delaying the inevitable by leaving PCIE support in a separate
machine type initially is going to be more painful long term.

Yes, I really think the 'virt' machine type needs to aim for PCIE
support sooner rather than later, if RISC-V wants to get on part
with other architectures. The best time to have added PCIE support
to 'virt' was when it was first created, the next best time is now.

Daniel
