LOPAPR support a somewhat asymmetrical NUMA setup in its current form, but
the Linux kernel doesn't support it. The effort to implement it in the current
spapr machine code, given that Linux wouldn't mind it, is not worth it. This
is why I chose to invalidate it for pseries.

I believe he's ok with it given that he suggested it in his first reply.

I'll move this verification to spapr machine_init in the next version.
