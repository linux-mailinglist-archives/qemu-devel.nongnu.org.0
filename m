Why BorrowedMutPointer provides both *const P and *mut P ? The *const P
conversion seems overlapping with BorrowedPointer.

Anyway, the &mut T -> *mut P conversion seems fairly rare to me and
error-prone. You usually give up ownership if you let the foreign function
tweak the P.

In any case, we don't need such conversion for QAPI, for now.

ForeignConvert::with_foreign (const *P -> T) doesn't take ownership.

The Rust reference for this kind of conversion is CStr::from_ptr.

as_ shouldn't create any object, and is thus unsuitable for a general
rs<->sys conversion function (any).

and that's what glib-rs uses (and CStr).

That's not used by glib afaik, but we should be able to introduce it for
"mut *P -> T", it's not incompatible with FromPtrFull::from_full.

In general, I like the fact that the conversion traits are associated to T,
and not to P (which can remain a bare pointer, without much associated
methods).

It may well be over the top.

No I mean they could be on different traits. One could be implemented
without the other. Or else I don't understand why the other conversion
functions would not be in that trait too.

To the cost of some duplication. I like the coupling between the traits
better. If you need a similar tuple/struct elsewhere, it's easy to make
your own.

The Storage type can quickly become quite complicated with QAPI, I would
rather avoid having to repeat it, it would create hideous compiler errors
too.

Yes I agree. Not sure why they made it a bare tuple, laziness perhaps :).
