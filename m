For what it=E2=80=99s worth, I had mixed results getting standard GPUs to b=

acknowledge is smaller. At least that=E2=80=99s the case for NVIDIA cards.

Regarding the Bluetooth use case, why would you need the Magic Mouse to be =
exposed directly to the guest? Is that to get the extra features of the mou=

=E2=80=99m asking because I=E2=80=99m using a Magic Trackpad connected to a=
 Mac Laptop and often interact with macOS VMs running on a distant machine =
over Screen Sharing, and I=E2=80=99ve not noticed any sensible loss in func=

sible that Apple Screen Sharing is doing something smart there, and that yo=
u would not get that benefit if your client is not itself running macOS. My=
 experience with VNC clients connecting to macOS VMs was nowhere as smooth.
