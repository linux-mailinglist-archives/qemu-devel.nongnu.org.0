At first, I tried to do a single implementation that works for both, but
it wasn't easily possible. I'm not sure any more if it was the only
problem, but at least drive-mirror targets don't have a known node-name,
so we would have to guess it from query-named-block-nodes. Not
impossible, but maybe not worth it...

At least it shows that errp does make it to the client. :-)

I'm not sure which way is currently better. QMP handlers are still
synchronous code that blocks the rest of QEMU, so doing things only
inside the coroutine does have some benefits. Maybe with coroutine QMP
handlers this will become less of a concern, though.
