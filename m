You are right:
 * The hidden documents are included in the navigation bar (different
from the table of contents).
 * The search index (which install-doc omits!) includes content from
the hidden documents.

I have asked on #sphinx-doc.  Let's see if there is a solution.

It might be possible to hack docs/config.py to exclude devel/ when run
from make install-sphinxdocs
(https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-exclude_patterns).
This requires building the docs again at install time but the
advantage is we get a single searchable set of documentation.
