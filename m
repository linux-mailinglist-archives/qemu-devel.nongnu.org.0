>=20

What I mean is: would you blame such a developer for *not* having a
machine himself/herself that he/she can try to reproduce the failure?
And would you consider a "Raspberry Pi 4 Model B" an easily available
hardware?

You mean aarch64, sure.  I'm not holding my breath, because we can
always have our own binaries/ports (or other executors such as ssh) but
I'm optimistic...

... and this point is one of the reasons.  The other is competition
from Travis-CI (and others).
