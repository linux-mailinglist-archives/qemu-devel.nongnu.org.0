A suspended monitor doesn't read monitor input.

We suspend

* a QMP monitor while the request queue is full

* an HMP monitor while it executes a command

* a multiplexed HMP monitor while the "mux-focus" is elsewhere

* an HMP monitor when it executes command "quit", forever

* an HMP monitor while it executes command "migrate" without -d

Let me explain the first item in a bit more detail.  Before OOB, a QMP
monitor was also suspended while it executed a command.  To make OOB
work, we moved the QMP monitors to an I/O thread and added a request
queue, drained by the main loop.  QMP monitors continue to read
commands, execute right away if OOB, else queue, suspend when queue gets
full, resume when it gets non-full.

The "run command in coroutine context" feature does not affect any of
this.

qapi-code-gen.txt does not talk about monitor suspension at all.  It's
instead discussed in qmp-spec.txt section 2.3.1 Out-of-band execution.

Stefan, what would you like us to clarify, and where?

Yes, events should be reported while a command is being executed.

Sending events takes locks.  Their critical sections are all
short-lived.  Another possible delay is the underlying character device
failing the send with EAGAIN.  That's all.

Fine print: qapi_event_emit() takes @monitor_lock.  It sends to each QMP
monitor with qmp_send_response(), which uses monitor_puts(), which takes
the monitor's @mon_lock.

The "run command in coroutine context" feature does not affect any of
this.

Stefan, what would you like us to clarify, and where?
