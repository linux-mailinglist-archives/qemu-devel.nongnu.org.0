Hi, Jason,

I generally have some reservations towards patches that did not receive any
R-bs. I think we should hear from Herve in this case, to confirm that this
change doesn't cause other problems while solving the original ones.

I hope this is not the case.

Regards,
Aleksandar

Hi All,<br>
<br>
There are bugs in the emulated dp8393x device that can stop packet<br>
reception in a Linux/m68k guest (q800 machine).<br>
<br>
With a Linux/m68k v5.5 guest (q800), it&#39;s possible to remotely trigger<=
br>
an Oops by sending ping floods.<br>
<br>
With a Linux/mips guest (magnum machine), the driver fails to probe<br>
the dp8393x device.<br>
<br>
With a NetBSD/arc 5.1 guest (magnum), the bugs in the device can be<br>
fatal to the guest kernel.<br>
<br>
Whilst debugging the device, I found that the receiver algorithm<br>
differs from the one described in the National Semiconductor<br>
datasheet.<br>
<br>
This patch series resolves these bugs.<br>
<br>
AFAIK, all bugs in the Linux sonic driver were fixed in Linux v5.5.<br>
