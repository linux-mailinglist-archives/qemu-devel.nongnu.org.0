Sure. There's no rush here, as QEMU has just entered freeze for
5.2, so at the very earliest patches for this feature wouldn't go
into master until mid-December.

Well, for sbsa-ref it doesn't need to go into the DTB. For
virt we mandate that everything is described in the DTB
(and that secure firmware should consume the DTB to figure
out where things live), so whatever power-control device we
come up with would have to be described there. I'm less sure
about ACPI because I think that is used only for describing
the non-secure environment to the non-secure EL2/EL1 code
so it doesn't need to describe devices that aren't visible there.
But I'm not very familiar with ACPI, hence my uncertainty.

Yeah, that's the kind of complexity that we would want to avoid
in 'virt', I think.
