The "solution" to that would presumably be to put everything into a
library, and the executable merely becomes trivial main() that calls
a "runme" function in the library. It is kind of ugly though as we
would need a separate library for each system emulator executable.

Just ignoring modules on Windows looks like the prudent solution.
