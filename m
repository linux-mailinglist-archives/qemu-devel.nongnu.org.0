Hi Laszlo,

Thanks for starting this thread.

TLS uses a source of randomness to establish symmetric session keys
for encryption. So it really depends on the use case whether HTTPS is
used for authentication or for confidentiality, and it seems to me
that it would typically be the former. So disabling HTTPS boot in this
case seems counterproductive to me.

The typical model is to seed a DRBG [deterministic pseudorandom
sequence generator] using a sufficient amount of high quality entropy.
Once you have done that, it is rather hard to exhaust a DRBG - it is a
mathematical construction that is designed to last for a long time (<=
2^48 invocations [not bytes] according to the NIST spec), after which
it does not degrade although it may have generated so much output that
its internal state may be inferred if you have captured enough of it
(which is a rather theoretical issue IMHO)

The problem is that using the output of a DRBG as a seed is
non-trivial - the spec describes ways to do this, but wiring
virtio-rng to a DRBG in the host and using its output to seed a DRBG
in the guest is slighly problematic.

So it seems to me that the correct way to model this is to make the
host's true entropy source a shared resource like any other.
