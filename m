Isn't H_CONFER a hypercall rather than instruction though? In QEMU's TCG
emulation case I would expect it just to exit to the (guest) hypervisor
which then schedules the next (guest) vCPU. It shouldn't be something
QEMU has to deal with.

If you are running QEMU as a KVM monitor this is still outside of it's
scope as all the scheduling shenanigans are dealt with inside the
kernel.

From QEMU's TCG point of view we want to concern ourselves with what the
real hardware would do - which I think in this case is drop to the
hypervisor and let it sort it out.
