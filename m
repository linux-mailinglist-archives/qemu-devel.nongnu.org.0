Yes, but if introspection could tell us which which values of addr.type
are valid, then a client should figure out the address families, as
follows.  Any valid value other than 'fd' corresponds to an address
family.  The set of values valid for addr.type therefore corresponds to
a set of address families.  The address families in that set are all
valid with 'fd', aren't they?

Awkward.  These types would have to differ structurally, or else they
are indistinguishable in introspection.

We implemented this in the form of QAPI feature flags, visible in
introspection.  You could do something like

  'addr': { 'type': 'SocketAddress',
            'features': [ 'unix' ] }

Hence my question: is it possible that address families other than unix
become available here?

When that happens, we have an introspection problem of the sort we
common solve with a feature flag.

Your answer appears to be "yes in theory, quite unlikely in practice".
Correct?
