Well, ID regs are special in the architecture -- they always exist
and must RAZ/WI, even if they're not actually given any fields yet.
This is different from other "unused" parts of the system register
encoding space, which UNDEF.

Older hosts didn't permit writing 0 to all parts of the ID
register space (and didn't list all ID registers in the KVM_GET_REG_LIST
list), but that was a kernel bug which we've since fixed.
(QEMU has workaround code for pre-4.15 kernels for this.)
Across that older bugfix, migration works from an old kernel to
a newer one, but wouldn't have worked from a post-bugfix kernel
to a pre-4.15 one.

The problem is that you've actually removed registers from
the list that were previously in it (because pre-SVE
kernels put this ID register in the list as a RAZ/WI register,
and now it's not in the list if SVE isn't supported).

What does this do as far as the user-facing list-of-registers
is concerned? All these registers need to remain in the
KVM_GET_REG_LIST list, or you break migration from an old
kernel to a new one.
