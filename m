Well, I wasn't able to reproduce that. So I've looked at the kvm part of
migration and it turned out migration didn't even start as KVM was
concerned.

Issue was in that migration related kvm code parts assumed 1:1
relation between MemorySection and memslot which isn't true anymore.
I'll respin v6 with that fixed (i.e. make sure that kvm parts can handle
1:n MemorySection:memslots invariant).

PS:
I've tested (1Gb segments hack) pinpong migration (via file) with Fedora 29
in boot loop.
