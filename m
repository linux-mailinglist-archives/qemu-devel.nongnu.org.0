We discussed these changes and they seem to be along the lines with
the future work on vfio over socket approach we will be working on later.

Could we for this experimental version have the changes you propose here
with one modification - instead of having generic remote-pci-device imply that that is LSI
device? And while we work towards vfio over socket this will become any remote
PCI device?

Yes, this is not great. And spaces are the problem at the moment.
I am looking if the -object has some properties that can allow for arbitrary
strings. Maybe such as data for "secret" object  would do?
