So I'm thinking:

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.qcow -F qcow img.qcow   =3D> okay

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.raw -F raw img.qcow   =3D> okay,=20
slightly risky (if backing.raw is ever changed to be non-raw), but then=20
again, backing files tend to be read-only (do we even support commit on=20
qcow images, or do we limit that to qcow2?)

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.qcow -F raw img.qcow   =3D> fails, due=
=20
to mismatch

qemu-img create -u -f qcow -b anything -F anything img.qcow $size  =3D>=20
fails: we can't write -F into the image, nor can we open anything to=20
probe its type to check that -F was correct

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.qcow img.qcow   =3D> warns, but okay=20
(we did not get -F, but the probe works out)

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.raw img.qcow    =3D> likewise warns

qemu-img create -f qcow -b backing.qcow2 img.qcow   =3D> error; new qcow=20
images (which you should avoid where possible anyways) must be backed by=20
only raw or qcow, going forward

Other scenarios?  Do the above ideas look reasonable?
