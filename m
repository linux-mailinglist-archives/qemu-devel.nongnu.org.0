This sounds like a bug in Spice, and not like a bug in QEMU. If you
still face this problem, please report it to the spice project instead
(see https://www.spice-space.org/support.html).

Title:
  Windows 10 clipboard bug

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  Hello,

  I am using qemu on arch:
      pacman -Q libvirt qemu linux virt-manager
  libvirt 3.5.0-1
  qemu 2.9.0-2
  linux 4.12.3-1
  virt-manager 1.4.1-2

  I have a windows 10 Guest, with all updates and the following packages in=
stalled in the guest:
  - QEMU guest agent 7.3.2
  - SPICE Guest Tools 0.132

  When I start the VM, I can copy/paste from the host to the guest.
  However, after I use COPY inside the VM, copy/paste is not working any
  more from host to guest. However, I can still copy/paste from guest to
  host.

  To summarize:
  - copy/paste from guest to host works always
  - copy/paste from host to guest works only if copy was not previously use=
d in guest.

  If this bug needs to be reported using another portal or if I can
  provide any further information, please contact me.

  Best Regards,
  gxgung
