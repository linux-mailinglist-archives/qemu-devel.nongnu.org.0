Would this be a useful addition to the doc comment?

Hmm, all members of @options are optional.  If I don't want to specify
any of them, I still have to say "options": {}.  Should @options be
optional, too?

Question is not relevant for x-blockdev-update-encryption, because
there, options.key-secret isn't actually optional.  Correct?

Imagine we find driver DRV needs options.  How would we extend your QAPI
schema then?

We can add DRV's options to this struct.  QMP clients then must use only
the LUKS members when the driver is actually LUKS, and only the DRV
members when it's actually DRV.  Works as long as all members are
optional.  Confusing, and ugly as sin.

We can add a second struct for DRV's options.  Call it
QCryptoEncryptionSetupOptionsDRV.  Add an optional parameter 'drv':
'QCryptoEncryptionSetupOptionsDRV' to x-blockdev-*-encryption, make
existing parameter @options optional.  Can't rename it to @luks
(compatibility break).  Probably want to rename
QCryptoEncryptionSetupOptions to QCryptoEncryptionSetupOptionsLUKS.  QMP
clients then must use @options when the driver is actually LUKS, and
@drv when it's actually DRV.  Less confusing, still ugly.

I'm not happy with either idea.  Do you have a better one?

Let's scratch "currently".

Yes, multiplexed commands are ugly more often than not.

Actually, blockdev-create is quite different in one important way: it
uses a *union* for driver-specific arguments, not a struct.

If we make QCryptoEncryptionSetupOptions ab union, like
BlockdevCreateOptions is, then the way to grow it to more drivers is
obvious.

We can talk about nesting later.
