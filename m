Yes, going the extra mile is better.

I recommend it for code that is actively maintained.  Making the code
simpler and thus easier to maintain is an investment that'll pay off.

We may have code where it won't pay off.  Do you think a blind
application of errp-guard.cocci might be better than nothing there?

LOL

A lesser craftsman than you would've peddled the generated commits
anyway.  Props!

If people care enough about [2] to submit patches, I'll feel obliged to
help merging them.

A bit of weeding on the side is always appreciated, but please don't
feel obliged to sink lots of time into code you don't care about.

Yes, automated feedback works best.

Relentless pressure from reviewers can also work in the long, long run.
But it's tiresome.

Of course, checkpatch.pl checks only new or changed code.  Any ideas on
how to make people aware of the opportunity to simplify their existing
code?  Obvious: posting more patches simplifying existing code we care
about.  Any other smart ideas?
