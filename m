Table D12-2 confirms the register should be RAZ, as it says the register
is "RO, but RAZ if SVE is not implemented". Does "RO" imply "WI", though?
For the guest we inject an exception on writes, and for userspace we
require the value to be preserved on write.

I think we should follow the spec, even for userspace access, and be RAZ
for when the feature isn't implemented. As for writes, assuming the
exception injection is what we want for the guest (not WI), then that's
correct. For userspace, I think we should continue forcing preservation
(which will force preservation of zero when it's RAZ).

Thanks,
