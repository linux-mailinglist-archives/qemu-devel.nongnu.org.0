Only the id_auth parameter is really considered large here.

When you say "up to a page size", that implies that the size is
actually variable.  Is that correct, and if so, what is a real
world common size going to be ? Is the common size much smaller
than this upper limit ? If so I'd just ignore the issue entirely.

If not, then, 4k on the command line is certainly ugly, but isn't
technically impossible. It would be similarly ugly to have this
value stuffed into a libvirt XML configuration for that matter.

One option is to supply only that one parameter via an external
file, with the file being an opaque blob whose context is the
parameter value thus avoiding inventing a custom file format
parser.

When "id_auth" is described as "authentication data", are there
any secrecy requirements around this ?

QEMU does have the '-object secret' framework for passing blobs
of sensitive data to QEMU and can allow passing via a file:

  https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/secrets.html

Even if this doesn't actually need to be kept private, we
could decide to simply (ab)use the 'secret' object anyway
as a way to let it be passed in out of band via a file.

Libvirt also has a 'secret' concept for passing blobs of
sensitive data out of band from the main XML config, which
could again be leveraged.

It does feel a little dirty to be using 'secrets' in libvirt
and QEMU for data that doesn't actually need to be secret,
just as a way to avoid huge config files. So we could just
ignore the secrets and directly have 'id_auth_file' as a
parameter and directly reference a file.

Daniel
