When doing an 'info registers' you don't have to interpret or parse 
much guest state, you just print it, and it's guest state that's
held separately (similarly a separate piece of state for info pic, info
tlb etc).  You might check the register state a little when you
decide which bits to print or how to format them, but that's about as
far as it goes.  So each of the 'info's (or query for qmp) correspond
to one logical chunk of qemu and/or guest state.

Printing a stack is a much hairier thing, with knowledge of guest
stack layout and potentially some heuristics.
