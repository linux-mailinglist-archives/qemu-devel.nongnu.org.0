Hi Laszlo. Thanks so much for sharing the details with us.
The reply nearly covers the boot sequence of aarch64 on the whole.

I see it in Qemu the *loader_start* is fixed at 1 GiB on the
physical address space which points to the DRAM base. In ArmVirtQemu.dsc
PcdDeviceTreeInitialBaseAddress is set 0x40000000 with correspondence.

Here I also see the discussion about DRAM base for ArmVirtQemu.
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-10/msg03127.html

I am still not sure how UEFI knows that it is running on a ArmVirtQemu
machine type. Does UEFI derive it from the fdt *compatible* property ?
