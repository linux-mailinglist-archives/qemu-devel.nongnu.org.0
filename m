A standard (and easier-to-use and powerful) QMP shell would be nice.

No, I mean just launching QEMU and communicating over QMP.

I think creating bindings for QMP commands is too much effort.  It would
duplicate the QAPI schema documentation because we'd need native API
documentation too.

I think clients should work at the QMP JSON level.

I don't have a clear design in mind yet but I've learnt a little from
writing the virtiofsd namespace isolation and seccomp code.  The task is
really hard for a general-purpose QEMU binary that supports all
features, because configuring the sandbox with the minimal attack
surface requires knowledge of the feature set being used in this QEMU
invocation :(.

I think duplication is in the nature of these isolation mechanisms.
systemd also supports most of the features necessary for isolation but
neither QEMU nor libvirt take advantage of systemd and it's not easy to
do so either.  I think it will be necessary to be pragmatic and look at
it on a case-by-case basis.  There will be some duplication.

I would like QEMU to directly expose APIs without the need for another
level of APIs, where this makes sense.  It's inefficient and slow to
develop stable APIs in QEMU and then repeat that work again in higher
layers of the stack.  To some extent this is unavoidable but I think
QEMU is close to providing usable APIs and tools itself in the areas
I've outlined in this email thread.

By doing this we'll create a better experience for Kata Containers and
other programs that directly use QEMU.

I think now is the right time to do it because there is awareness and
willingness to find solutions both in libvirt and QEMU.  I'm optimistic
that progress can be made here.

The next step is a more detailed plan so that multiple people can work
on these tasks.
