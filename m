This code segment is copied from what 'qemu-img amend' does, so adding a=20
helper function would indeed make life a bit easier for more than one=20
spot in the code base.  Separate patch, obviously.

The comment change is collateral (only because I noticed it in the=20
diff); but I could indeed reword it slightly more accurately as:

Check if bitmaps prevent a resize.  Although bitmaps can be resized,=20
there are situations where we don't know whether to set or clear new=20
bits, so for now it's easiest to just prevent resize in those cases.

And since it is a collateral change, it may even be worth splitting into=20
a separate patch.

I was looking primarily for version (2 vs. 3), size (did it change), and=20
number of snapshots.  You're right that grepping for what changes will=20
make this easier to maintain.

Yep, that's the same list I was noticing when writing the patch.

Yes, the commit message tried to call it out.  It's a pre-existing=20
problem - during amend, we DO make changes to the disk in one step, with=20
no way to roll back those changes, even if a later step fails.

Pre-patch, if you request an upgrade to v3 as well as a resize, but=20
resize fails, you still end up with the image being changed to v3.=20
That's no different from post-patch where if you request a resize and a=20
downgrade to v2, the resize happens but not the downgrade.  On the=20
bright side, our current failure scenarios at least leave the resulting=20
image viable, even if it is not the same as it was pre-attempt.

.

Yes, it was a pain for me while writing the tests.  At one point I even=20
considered swapping things to do the resize after the downgrade, but=20
that introduces a different problem: the downgrade depends on knowing=20
the post-transaction size (because downgrading is safe only when all=20
internal snapshots match the post-resize length), but we aren't passing=20
the desired size through to the upgrade and downgrade functions.  Worse,=20
if we swap the downgrade first, and it succeeds but then resize fails,=20
the image is no longer viable; at least with the current ordering, even=20
though user data has been truncated, it remains v3 so the size=20
differences in snapshots don't break the image (and the user DID request=20
an image resize, so it's not like we are discarding data accidentally).

If we want to avoid truncating an image at all costs on any potential=20
failure path, we have to add a lot more plumbing (not to say it's a bad=20
thing, just that it's more work).  And no matter how much plumbing we=20
add, or transaction-like rollback capabilities we add, there's still the=20
risk that we will hit a late EIO error leaving the image in a=20
half-changed state, even if none of our sanity checks failed.  Or put=20
another way, without some sort of journaling, the best we can do is=20
defer all writes until we know the full set of changes, which limits the=20
likelihood of a half-baked change to a write failure.  But since we can=20
only reduce, and not eliminate, the possibility of a half-baked change,=20
the question then becomes whether it is worth the engineering effort of=20
additional complexity for even more corner cases and less risk, or just=20
leave things as they are (if qemu-img amend fails, we make no guarantees=20
about the state of your image).

I'm not sure the work in making amend more transaction-like is worth it=20
- yes, we can add more validation code up front before making the first=20
write change, but as some of the later changes depend on information=20
that would be changed earlier, that becomes a lot more state we have to=20
collect during our initial probes (my example being that the downgrade=20
attempt depends on knowing the final image size, and that's a lot easier=20
when the image has already been resized rather than having to pass the=20
new size through).
