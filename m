The current approach is that the version is expanded into configuration
parameters when the device is instantiated. Those parameters are then
used to check migration compatibility of the destination (versions don't
play a role once the device has been created).

Michael replied in another sub-thread wondering if versions are really
necessary since tools do the migration checks. Let's try dropping
versions to simplify things. We can bring them back if needed later.

You need to upgrade the migration code in order to produce that extra
data. Why not define a configuration parameter alongside this code
change?

The device state representation may have a way of sending optional data.
Since it just gets dropped if the destination doesn't recognize it there
is no need to introduce a configuration parameter and it doesn't play a
part in migration compatibility checks.
