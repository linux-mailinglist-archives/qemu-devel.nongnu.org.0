The experience acquired here deserves the highest consideration, but I
can't help myself to wonder if this isn't one of the (conceptual)
reasons for parameters such as '-nodefaults'.  I know QEMU doesn't
promise the same behavior across different targets, but that could
improve considerably with very cheap actions.

You can consider me biased (I do consider myself), but trying to wear
the hat of a user first interacting with QEMU, I would expect a (any)
reasonably capable environment that can represent the given target.
That will probably be a different environment than the one I may need,
and I think that's fine.

Now on the functional testing side, this means less code adjusting to
the specifics of each target, and overall, more test code that could
be reused across different targets.  I believe the same to be true
for management layer code.

Anyway, it'd be nice to just double check if keeping things as they
are is in this specific aspect is a firm yes.  If so, tests (and
management layers) will (continue to) have to adapat.

Best,
- Cleber.
