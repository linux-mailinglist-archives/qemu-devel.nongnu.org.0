right, with python interface what I could think of is,

1. we don't have to patch up every experimental interactions and recompil=
e.
2. we can easily feed in invalid data type to see the behavior for negati=
ve/error
   scenarios.
3. Similar to qtest and acceptance test we can use this to cover many sce=
narios.
4. Ease the CI and maintenance to have test/code separately.
