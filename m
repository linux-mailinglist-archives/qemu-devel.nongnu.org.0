Possibly z990, if I'm reading the gcc processor_flags_table[] correctly; 
long-displacement-facility is definitely a minimum.

We probably should revisit what the minimum for TCG should be, assert those features at 
startup, and drop the corresponding runtime tests.

Interesting.  If we include extended-immediate-facility (base_GEN9_GA1, z9-109?) in the 
bare minimum that would definitely simplify a few things.

I don't know.  It's difficult for me to guess whether a dependency chain like

     val -> xor -> xor

(3 insns with serial dependencies) is better than

     val   --> xor
     load  -/

(3 insns, but only one serial dependency) is better.  But there may also be instruction 
fusion going on at the micro-architectural level, so that there's really only one xor.

If you have suggestions, I'm all ears.

If we assume general-instruction-extension-facility (z10?), LGRL + XGR is smaller than 
XILF + XIFH, ignoring the constant pool entry which might be shared, and modulo the Âµarch 
questions above.

Sadly not, because of OILL et al.  There are no 16-bit xor immediate insns.

Really?  How does the processor distinguish between overwriting opcode/condition vs 
overwriting immediate operand when invalidating cached instructions?

If overwriting operand truly isn't correct, then I think we have to use indirect branch 
always for goto_tb.

Yes.  It's call clobbered, so it isn't live so often, but sometimes.
