From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

For good reason, vhost-user is currently built asynchronously, that
way better performance can be obtained. However, for certain use
cases such as simulation, this is problematic.

Consider an event-based simulation in which both the device and CPU
have are scheduled according to a simulation "calendar". Now, for
example, consider the CPU sending a command to the device, over a
vring in the vhost-user protocol. In this case, the CPU must wait
for the vring update to have been processed, so that the device has
time to put an entry onto the simulation calendar to obtain time to
handle the interrupt, before the CPU goes back to scheduling and
thus updates the simulation calendar or even has the simulation
move time forward.

This cannot easily achieved with the eventfd based vring kick/call
design.

Extend the protocol slightly, so that a message can be used for kick
and call instead, if the new VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_KICK_CALL_MSGS is
negotiated. This in itself doesn't guarantee synchronisation, but both
sides can also negotiate VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_REPLY_ACK and thus get
a reply to this message by setting the need_reply flag, and ensure
synchronisation this way.
