Sender: "Qemu-devel" <qemu-devel-bounces+lists+qemu-devel=lfdr.de@nongnu.org>

One of the recent commits changed the way qemu-io prints out its
errors and warnings - they are now prefixed with the program name.
We've got to adapt the iotests accordingly to prevent that they
are failing.

Fixes: 99e98d7c9fc1a1639fad ("qemu-io: Use error_[gs]et_progname()")
