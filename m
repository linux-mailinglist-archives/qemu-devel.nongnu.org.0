+s390 hardware IPL
+-----------------
=20
 The s390 hardware IPL process consists of the following steps.
=20
-1. A READ IPL ccw is constructed in memory location 0x0.
-    This ccw, by definition, reads the IPL1 record which is located on the=
 disk
-    at cylinder 0 track 0 record 1. Note that the chain flag is on in this=
 ccw
-    so when it is complete another ccw will be fetched and executed from m=
emory
-    location 0x08.
-
-2. Execute the Read IPL ccw at 0x00, thereby reading IPL1 data into 0x00.
-    IPL1 data is 24 bytes in length and consists of the following pieces o=
f
-    information: [psw][read ccw][tic ccw]. When the machine executes the R=
ead
-    IPL ccw it read the 24-bytes of IPL1 to be read into memory starting a=
t
-    location 0x0. Then the ccw program at 0x08 which consists of a read
-    ccw and a tic ccw is automatically executed because of the chain flag =
from
-    the original READ IPL ccw. The read ccw will read the IPL2 data into m=
emory
-    and the TIC (Transfer In Channel) will transfer control to the channel
-    program contained in the IPL2 data. The TIC channel command is the
-    equivalent of a branch/jump/goto instruction for channel programs.
-    NOTE: The ccws in IPL1 are defined by the architecture to be format 0.
