I've now gone through and given review comments on the patchset.
I don't think there was anything particularly major -- overall
I like the structure and API (and also the documentation!).

The one topic I think we could do with discussing is whether
a simple uint64_t giving the frequency of the clock in Hz is
the right representation. In particular in your patch 9 the
board has a clock frequency that's not a nice integer number
of Hz. I think Philippe also mentioned on irc some board where
the UART clock ends up at a weird frequency. Since the
representation of the frequency is baked into the migration
format it's going to be easier to get it right first rather
than trying to change it later.

So what should the representation be? Some random thoughts:

1) ptimer internally uses a 'period plus fraction' representation:
 int64_t period is the integer part of the period in nanoseconds,
 uint32_t period_frac is the fractional part of the period
(if you like you can think of this as "96-bit integer
period measured in units of one-2^32nd of a nanosecond").
However its only public interfaces for setting the frequency
are (a) set the frequency in Hz (uint32_t) or (b) set
the period in nanoseconds (int64_t); the period_frac part
is used to handle frequencies which don't work out to
a nice whole number of nanoseconds per cycle.

2) I hear that SystemC uses "value plus a time unit", with
the smallest unit being a picosecond. (I think SystemC
also lets you specify the duty cycle, but we definitely
don't want to get into that!)

3) QEMUTimers are basically just nanosecond timers

4) The MAME emulator seems to work with periods of
96-bit attoseconds (represented internally by a
32-bit count of seconds plus a 64-bit count of
attoseconds). One attosecond is 1e-18 seconds.

Does anybody else have experience with other modelling
or emulator technology and how it represents clocks ?

I feel we should at least be able to represent clocks
with the same accuracy that ptimer has.

thanks
