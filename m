MigrationInfo is returned by  query-migrate.  No other users.

Doc comment gives us wiggle room: "only returned if compression feature
is on".  Can it be on after this patch?

If no, the member can go without breaking query-migrate compatibility.

query-qmp-schema shows the change, though.  Could conceivably affect
users, but it seems unlikely.

Eric, Mike, we might want to grant ourselves explicit license to change
query-qmp-schema in such ways, by having qapi-code-gen.txt state
optional members may be removed when they can't be present anymore.
What do you think?

Alternatively, keep the member, hardcode value to whatever is returned
before the patch when compression is off, deprecate, remove after grace
period.  A bit more work, but safer.  Worthwhile?  Not for me to decide.

With MigrationCapability @compress gone, attempting to set it with
migrate-set-capabilities fails with GenericError, "desc": "Invalid
parameter 'compress'".

Setting capability "compress" can fail before this patch, but only when
you do it in the middle of a migration, so this is actually a new error.

Adding errors is explicitly permitted in docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt
section "Compatibility Considerations":

    However, Clients must not assume any particular:

We're good.

What capabilties are returned when is not specified.

Aside: it should be, shouldn't it?

qmp_query_migrate_capabilities() returns them all, except it skips
"block" when !defined CONFIG_LIVE_BLOCK_MIGRATION.  De facto ABI due to
the gap in the documented ABI.

Removing capability "compress" is a break of this de facto ABI.
Acceptable when we're confident the ABI's users don't care.

Alternatively, keep them, hardcode value to false, deprecate, remove
after grace period.

Aside: you might want to make MigrationCapability @block conditional like

   { 'enum': 'MigrationCapability',
     'data': ['xbzrle', 'rdma-pin-all', 'auto-converge', 'zero-blocks',
              'compress', 'events', 'postcopy-ram', 'x-colo', 'release-ram'=

MigrateSetParameters is the (boxed) argument of migrate-set-parameters.
No other users.

With these optional members, attempting to use them with
migrate-set-parameters fails with GenericError, "desc": "Invalid
parameter 'NAME'".

Same argument as for migrate-set-capabilities above.  Good.

MigrateSetParameters is returned by query-migrate-parameters.  No other
users.

Even thought the members are optional, the doc comment specifies all are
returned.  qmp_query_migrate_parameters() does.

Removing the parameters breaks this promise.  Acceptable when we're
confident the ABI's users don't care.

Alternatively, keep them, hardcode value to whatever is returned before
the patch when compression is off, deprecate, remove after grace period.
