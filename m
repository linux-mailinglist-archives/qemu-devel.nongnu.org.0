And that is enough to make me think this series is -rc3 material. 
Although I'm not yet sure whether the solution is this series as 
written, or to patch libvirt to look elsewhere for bitmap information, 
or to patch qemu on incoming migration to not complain when reloading a 
RO bitmap, or something else.

I'd really like to hear from Virtuozzo on the topic before committing to 
this series, but I will at least review it in the meantime.
