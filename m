I believe so, in so much as it has not complained about leaks in
libvirt where we've removed the free() calls in favour of the
attribute(cleanup) annotations. I'm presuming this is because the
free() calls do still exist - they're simply automatically added
in all paths that exist a code scope. You can still see the free()
calls in GDB stack traces for example.

Daniel
