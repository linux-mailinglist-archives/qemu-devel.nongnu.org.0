Yes.

Yes.

We can copy the logic which calculates lchs from seabios to qemu and use
it for pchs.

The tricky part of this is how to do the switch without requiring a
lockstep update of seabios and qemu.  seabios can't easily know whenever
it should use the current logic (current qemu) or whenever it should
simply use pchs with translation=3Dnone (updated qemu).

Hmm ...

Well, there also is MODE_PAGE_FLEXIBLE_DISK_GEOMETRY.

Why do you want migrate _to_ IDE?

Well, adding new fw_cfg interfaces has a long term maintenance cost.
So there should be a pretty good reason for them.

cheers,
