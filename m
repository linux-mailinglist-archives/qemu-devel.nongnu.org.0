We with Eduardo basically agree on contents/set of properties to print,
it is only different phrasing (Eduardo's suggestion is better than what we have now).
But lets get to what problem you are going to fix/improve. SO I've went ahead and tried
with following CLI:

   qemu-system-x86_64 -smp 1,maxcpus=4 -numa node,cpus=0-1 -numa node,cpus=2-3 -monitor stdio -device qemu64-x86_64-cpu,socket-id=1,core-id=0,thread-id=0,node-id=1

end it errored out with:

  qemu-system-x86_64: -device qemu64-x86_64-cpu,socket-id=1,core-id=0,thread-id=0,node-id=1: node-id=1 must match numa node specified with -numa option

As you see we already have all user provide properties for cpu (including invalid ones) reported,
what we are missing is suggestion for valid node-id. How about following error message:

qemu-system-x86_64: -device qemu64-x86_64-cpu,socket-id=1,core-id=0,thread-id=0,node-id=1: invalid node-id, must be 0
