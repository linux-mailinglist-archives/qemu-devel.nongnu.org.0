Hi Aleksandar,

As for riscv-v-spec 0.7.1, it is first stable spec for target software
development
though the name is working draft.  The architecture skeleton is fix and
most of
work are focusing the issues related to micro-architecture implementation
complexity.
Sifive has released an open source implementation on spike simulation and
Imperas also
provides another implementation with its binary simulator.  I think it is
worth to include the extension
in Qemu at this moment.

As for riscv-p-spec-0.5, I think Andes has fully supported this extension
and should release more
detailed spec in the near future (described Riscv Technical Update
2019/06).
They have implement lots of DSP kernel based on this extension and also
provided impressed
performance result.  It is also worth to be reviewed (at least [RFC]) if
the detailed  spec is public.
