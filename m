Yes, but the default CPU model if none is specified should ideally
not be one which only works with one accelerator (among other
things, that makes it more complicated to implement and to probe for
because you need to ensure it's set after the accelerator is
selected and that if you're probing that you've told QEMU what
the accelerator type is).

Either -cpu host or -cpu max will work. If your host is a real
Cortex-A57 then I think -cpu cortex-a57 will work; similarly
with -cpu cortex-a53 on a host A53. (The underlying constraint
here is that the kernel doesn't support "claim to the guest
that it is running on some different CPU than the host CPU",
so you can't use command line options or defaults that would
require that.) 32-bit arm is similar. The other point to note
is that the "virt" board's default CPU is Cortex-A15 for
historical reasons, which means that in practice if you want
to use 64-bit KVM you don't want the default value.
