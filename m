That sounds fine, thanks.  I interpreted the text a little differently.
I agree this functionality doesn't need to present in order to move to
GitLab.

If the goal is to run multiple trees through the CI in parallel then
multiple branches can be used.  I guess I'm just

Another question:
Is a Merge Request necessary in order to trigger the CI or is just
pushing to a branch enough?  With GitHub + Travis just pushing is
enough.
