I would strongly vote for QAPI-based. It doesn't have to be fully based
on QAPI structs internally, but the defining property for me is that the
external interface is described in the QAPI schema (which implies using
QAPI structs for the external facing code).

Not only is it a PITA to work with things like "gen": false or "props":
"any", but having two systems to configure things side by side is also
highly inconsistent.

I have recently discussed object-add with Markus, or to be more precise,
a QAPIfied --object in qsd wrapping it. This doesn't work well without
having a schema. I believe the right thing to do there is build a QAPI
schema describing the existing QOM properties in a first step (which
already gives you all of the advantages of QAPI like introspection), and
then in a second step generate the respective QOM code for initialising
the properties from the schema instead of duplicating it.

This can get challenging with dynamic properties, but as far as I can
see, user creatable objects only have class properties or object
properties created right in .instance_init (which should be equivalent).

As the number of user creatable objects isn't too large, this shouldn't
be too hard. I'm less sure about device-add, though in theory the same
approch would probably result in the best interface.
