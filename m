Paolo, can you also elaborate what was your original intent in this QEMU =
commit you made:
f8dc4c645ec2 ("target/i386: rename HF_SVMI_MASK to HF_GUEST_MASK")

How did you expect this flag to be used in nVMX migration?
Currently the HF_GUEST_MASK flag in KVM that is set in vcpu->arch.hflags =
is never propagated to userspace.
Did you expect to set HF_GUEST_MASK in QEMU=E2=80=99s hflag based on =
nested_state returned by KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE ioctl?
What is the value of this hflag in QEMU given that we have all the =
information we need in env->nested_state?
(E.g. We can deduce vCPU is in VMX non-root mode by testing for =
(env->nested_state.flags & KVM_STATE_NESTED_GUEST_MODE)).
