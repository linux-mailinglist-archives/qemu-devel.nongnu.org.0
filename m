Furthermore, the "CPU plug operation in progress" flag should be:
- either migrated,
- or a migration blocker.

Because on the destination host, device_add should be possible if and
only if the plug operation completed (either still on the source host,
or on the destination host).

I guess that the "migration blocker" option is easier.

Anyway I assume this is already handled with memory hotplug somehow
(i.e., migration attempt between device_add and ACPI_DEVICE_OST).

Thanks,
Laszlo
