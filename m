Hi,

This series:

(1) Keeps patch 1, as the previous series, and

(2) Decides whether all *drained_end* functions should poll or not; as
    proposed by Kevin, all that should not poll now get a
    @drained_end_counter pointer, whose pointee they have to increment
    once for every background operation scheduled, and that background
    operation will decrement it once it settles.
    This allows functions that should poll to do so until the counter
    reaches 0, so they don=E2=80=99t have to poll after scheduling every =
single
    operation but can do so once in a place where it=E2=80=99s safe.

v3:
- Change the design as described above (drained_end_counter instead of a
  list of BdrvCoDrainData objects to poll)
- Added a test to test-bdrv-drain
