Um... I'm not really clear on where you're imagining this going.  In
the OF model, device operations are done by "opening" a device tree
node then executing methods on it, so you can't really even get to
this point without a bunch of DT stuff.

Again, I'm not even really sure what you mean by this.  We already
enter SLOF with r3 pointing to a device tree.  I'm not sure what
stashing it would accomplish.  GRUB as it stands expects an OF style
entry point though, not a flat tree style entry point.

Are you suggesting rewriting it to run in that environment?  That
might be an option, but it's certainly not easy.  We'd have to write
"native" grub drivers for all the devices we care about, rather than
calling into OF for them.  Maybe there's some x86 code we could
already use here?  I don't know how much GRUB relies on the BIOS or
UEFI for device access on PC.

So, part of the confusion is that there are two things we're
considering here and it's not really clear yet how much they overlap.

1) Is using petitboot as our bootloader.  That gives us basically
every driver, network protocol and tool we could ever want.  However,
it gets to the next stage via kexec(), so it can only support OSes
which are kexec()able - i.e. Linux.  This is mostly speculation at
this point.

2) Having a way of booting existing clients - i.e. those that expect
OF-style entry conditions - but without having to maintain a blob of
Forth.  The "kill slof" patches are a concrete, if limited, attempt at
this.

I'm not really sure I agree with you there.

Maybe, but I'm not really sure where you're picturing it fitting in.

Well.. that's an interesting question.

Yes... though if people attach a graphical console they might be
pretty surprised that they don't get anything on there.  Supporting
that means adding vga, which adds substantial complexity (especially
since text mode isn't really a thing for a vga on a POWER machine).

> and sPAPR-vSCSI clients can keep using SLOF.

We can possibly ignore the spapr virtual devices.  They seemed like
they'd be important for people transitioning from guests under
PowerVM, but honestly I'm not sure they've ever been used much.

We do support emulated (or passthrough) PCI devices.  I don't know if
they're common enough that we need boot support for them.  Netboot
=66rom a vfio network adaptor might be something people want.

USB storage is also a fairly likely candidate, and that would add a
*lot* of extra complexity, since we'd need both the HCD and storage
drivers.
