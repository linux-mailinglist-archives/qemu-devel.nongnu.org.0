Yes, I think it is.
However, I'm curious which devices you're finding are explicitly setting
their id's;  there aren't many - although there are some that probably
should!
For example, running an x86 image with:
   -device isa-parallel,chardev=3D... -device isa-serial -device isa-serial=
 -trace enable=3Dqemu_loadvm_state_section_startfull

shows:
qemu_loadvm_state_section_startfull(uint32_t section_id, const char *idstr,=
 uint32_t instance_id, uint32_t version_id) "%u(%s) %u %u"

165217@1576179638.856300:qemu_loadvm_state_section_startfull 41(serial) 0 3
165217@1576179638.856307:qemu_loadvm_state_section_startfull 42(serial) 1 3
165217@1576179638.856311:qemu_loadvm_state_section_startfull 43(parallel_is=
a) 0 1

so those two serial devices are instances '0' and '1' I think by luck of
their command line order, rather than having specified their base
address (which would have been safer).
