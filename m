Hmm, ^this is not consistent with how patch 1/5 reports this information,=
 but
looking at the existing docs we're not doing very well in terms of consis=
tency
there either.

I suggest we go with "(read-write)" in both patch 1/5 and here and then s=
tart
the paragraph with "This is an optional attribute."

after the target device has been created.

side note: maybe add something like "(see the migration_version attribute=
 of
the device node if the target device already exists)" in the same section=
 in
patch 1/5.

Overall, the same comments as in 1/5 apply text-wise.
