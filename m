This reads a little awkwardly, instead:

 The daemon can control which peers can send/recv messages using various
 metadata attributes, however, this is alone is not generally sufficient
 to make the deployment secure.

In the last point add

    ', unless additional unless additional controls
     such as SELinux or AppArmor are applied'.

Perhaps change the last few words to

  'for services implemented & distributed by the QEMU project'
