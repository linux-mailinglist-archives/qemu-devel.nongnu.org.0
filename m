I hope it isn=92t that simple or I=92ve written a 42-patch series for
nothing. :-/
(https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-08/msg00350.html)

On of the problems is that we actually need to think about whether the
functions that currently use backing_bs() really want a COW backing BDS,
or are content with a filtered BDS, too, or maybe want to skip implicit
filters, and so on.
