Hi Sven,

Certainly in some cases it isn't possible to model devices in QEMU exactly as real
hardware, although I think that some of the ideas above could be used to improve the
implementation without too much extra effort.

Then again from my work on QEMU I completely understand that sometimes this can be
difficult with older, more esoteric devices. Ultimately after review that decision
has to come from the maintainer(s) for the relevant devices/machines, so I guess that
would be Richard and/or Gerd in this case?


ATB,

Mark.
