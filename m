Hello Alex,
 Thank you for your response, if I am on the right path I want to add
hadamard or one of pauli gate to gnu assembler then I want to run this
extended GAS via qemu using user space emulation. i.e.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Hadamard_(H)_gate.
The idea is there are many quantum computer emulators i.e. here
https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/list-qc-simulators , yet I couldnt find
any one of them uses qemu. For beginning I wanted to try to port
libquantum hadamard impl.  There is https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm
but source is not present.

It's not clear what you want to do. Are you looking to extend an
existing instruction set with additional custom instructions? Can you
explain why you want to do this?

For testing you don't need a custom toolchain - you can use inline
assembly with data statements to insert your custom instructions into a
program. Again it depends on what your eventual aim is here.
