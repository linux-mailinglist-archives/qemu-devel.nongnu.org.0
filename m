Public bug reported:

Hi,
I have a macOS 10.15.7 vm with GPU passthrough (NVIDIA GTX Titan Black), li=
bvirt xml has path to vbios too.
Qemu 5.1.0-1 with libvirt 6.5.0-2 are installed in manjaro architect 20.1.1=
 (two kernels tried: 5.4.67 LTS and 5.8.11 stable, no difference).
I have two monitors, one with hdmi and one with vga inputs.
Usually the gpu is connected to one monitor with hdmi, the other one with D=
VI (on gpu)-->vga adapter, so:
1st monitor: hdmi-->hdmi
2nd monitor: DVI-->vga adapter-->vga

With this setup, launching "virsh start Catalina" has no problem.

If I detach the hdmi cable from monitor 1, I cannot start qemu anymore: the=
 2nd monitor turns black, it doesn't seem it has "no-signal", but only a bl=
ack screen with the power led blinking (usually a window on the monitor flo=
ats around with "no signal" displayed when there is no signal to monitor).
I say "qemu doesn't start" because in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/Catalina.log th=
ere's no trace.

Detaching hdmi works with qemu 4.2 and libvirt 5.10, so this could be
related to qemu update.

Apologize, I know there aren't much information here, if someone can
guide me to test the issue I would be grateful.

Thanks for your attention
