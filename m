Review of 9pfs is a best effort thing... I usually stop reviewing when I'm fed
up or when all the time I could reasonably invest is elapsed. Breaking down
the series in smaller patches is the usual improvement for that.

I don't remember questioning the overall concept behind these changes
because it looks reasonable enough (even if I would appreciate to be
able to verify them with a working reproducer).

Even if it is invisible to the users, coding style or how a series is
broken down in patches is important for developers.

FWIW this patchset was more than 10 patches and now it is only 5 :)

The good news is that you'll soon be able to merge things by yourself.
I'll help you when I can but I won't be the gating factor anymore.

I would personally do the opposite... again ;)

Like you say we essentially care for 9p2000.L and we only do limited
support for 9p2000.u. If we have a change that we really want for
9p2000.L but it has an impact on 9p2000.u because of shared code,
it is fine to do the changes anyway, including changes to the 9p2000.u
specific code. Very basic testing of 9p2000.u (mount/ls or find/umount)
or maybe running pjd-fstest is enough IMHO. If we break someone's setup
and he complains, then we can ask him to test a fix before we merge it.

That would ruin my day...

More seriously, the recent fix for a deadlock condition that was present
for years proves that nobody seems to be using silly clients with QEMU.
So I think we should just dump the lock and add a one-time warning in
the top level handlers when we detect a duplicate readdir request on
the same fid. This should be a very simple patch (I can take care of
it right away).
