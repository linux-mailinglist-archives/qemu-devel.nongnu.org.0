We declared multifd supported from v4.0.0 onwards, so changing the wire
protocol in non-backwards compatibles ways is not acceptable IMHO.

Ideally we'd change QEMU so that the src QEMU serializes the connections,
such that the migration thread I/O channel is established before we attempt
to establish the multifd channels.

If changing the wire protocol is unavoidable, then we'd need to invent
a new migration capability for the mgmt apps to detect & opt-in to when
both sides support it.

Daniel
