I am not going to do much more than what I posted today, basically only the
automated conversion.

The main issue with this series and Kashyap's is that if we don't manage to
get everything done in 5.0 we have a mutilated qemu-doc. Then either we
keep it mutilated or we scramble to undo the work. So I would agree to
commit the series in this order, but without the removal of the .texi files=
.

It would be a kind of "insurance" against being late, basically. Doc
changes are rare enough that we could manage it, I think (and as long as
code review catches changes to only one version of the docs, no bitrot is
possible since we would build both).
