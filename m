I've never even seen mention of -tb_size argument before myself, nor
seen anyone else using it and libvirt doesn't set it, so I think
this is not a valid assumption.

Hmm, 600e17b261555c56a048781b8dd5ba3985650013 says it was 32 MB as the
default in its commit message, which seems to match the code doing

 #define DEFAULT_CODE_GEN_BUFFER_SIZE_1 (32 * MiB)

There's no default memory size - its up to whomever/whatever creates the
VMs to choose how much RAM is given.

Daniel
