Internal snapshots are not incremental or differential at the qcow2
level, they are simply a separate L1/L2 table pointing to data clusters.
In other words, they are an independent set of metadata showing the full
state of the image at the point of the snapshot.  qcow2 does not track
relationships between snapshots and parents/children.

Nope.  Deleting a snapshot decrements the reference count on all its
data clusters.  If a data cluster's reference count reaches zero it will
be freed.  That's all, there is no additional data movement or
reorganization aside from this.

No.  qcow2 has the concept of the current disk state of the running VM -
what you get when you boot the guest - and the snapshots - they are
read-only.

When you delete snapshots the current disk state (running VM) is
unaffected.

When you apply a snapshot this throws away the current disk state and
uses the snapshot as the new current disk state.  The read-only snapshot
itself is not modified in any way and you can apply the same snapshot
again as many times as you wish later.

If you want an analogy then git(1) is a pretty good one.  qcow2 internal
snapshots are like git tags.  Unlike branches, tags are immutable.  In
qcow2 you only have a master branch (the current disk state) from which
you can create a new tag or you can use git-checkout(1) to apply a
snapshot (discarding whatever your current disk state is).
