I really don't like this last sentance. The qualifier

  ', when an individual acts as a representative or member...'

is opening up a clear loophole to escape consequences under the
QEMU CoC.

Consider someone is kicked out from another project for violation
of that project's CoC, that would also be considered a violation
under QEMU's CoC. This qualifier is explicitly stating that the CoC
violation in the other project has no bearing on whether that
person can now start participating in QEMU. I think that's a bad
mixed message we're sending there. It is especially poor if the
victim from the other project is also a QEMU contributor.

The wording Thomas' draft has

  In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may
  affect a person's ability to participate within them.

doesn't require QEMU to take action. It just set a statement
of intent that gives QEMU the freedom to evaluate whether it is
reasonable to take action to protect its contributors, should a
contributor wish to raise an issue that occurred outside QEMU.

Regards,
Daniel
