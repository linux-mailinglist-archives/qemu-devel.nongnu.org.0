I had not considered TLS.  If a non-qemu library maintains connection state, then
we won't be able to support it for live update until the library provides interfaces
to serialize the state.

For qemu objects, so far vmstate has been adequate to represent the devices with
descriptors that we preserve.

The descriptors covered in these patches are needed for our use case.  I realize
there are others that could perhaps be preserved, but we have not tried them.
Those descriptors are closed on exec as usual, and are reopened after exec. I
expect that we or others will support more over time.

Correct.

Ouch.
