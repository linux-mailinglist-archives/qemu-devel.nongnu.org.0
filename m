Ugh. "[PATCH v5 00/18] nvme: refactoring and cleanups" doesn't apply
completely cleanly.

"[PATCH 0/2] hw/block/nvme: fixes for interrupt behavior" was intented
to go into master because it fixes a bug, that is why I split them up.

But looks like it is better to just roll it into this series. I'll
respin a v6 with the two interrupt fixes.
