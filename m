It should be possible to add nvdimm and memory hotplug later.
(I don't see big issues here, as long as it would be possible
to carve out continuous range in address space for it.

Considering ABI to guest, one could reuse QEMU's notification/enumeration
code for that or implement their own.

PS:
However there will be the same issues that we've had with Seabios when
ACPI tables were generated there (i.e. cease-less invention of interfaces
to to pass information from QEMU to firmware). But if I recall correctly,
it seems that it's intentional design decision for this board,
where user supplies/builds in firmware a board description (acpi/dt/...)
manually.
