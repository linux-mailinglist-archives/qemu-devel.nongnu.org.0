It seemed "easy" to add cortex-m7 based on cortex-m4 (copy m4
description, update ID register values), but I realized that QEMU does
not support FPv5 which not only supports DP, but also adds new
instructions that QEMU does not handle yet (see section A2.5 of the
ARMv7-M ARM).

* Are there plans to implement them?
* If not, how difficult is it? (for a developer not very familiar with the =
QEMU code base)

Title:
  Support more ARM CPUs

Status in QEMU:
  Won't Fix

Bug description:
  Hi,

  This is an enhancement request, rather than a bug report.

  After some discussions/presentations during the last Linaro Connect
  (SFO17), I understand that it may be easy to add support for more ARM
  CPUs in QEMU. I am interested in user-mode, if that matters.

  I'm primarily using QEMU for GCC validations, and I'd like to make
  sure that GCC doesn't generate instructions not supported by the CPU
  it's supposed to generate code for.

  I'd like to have:
  cortex-m0
  cortex-m4
  cortex-m7
  cortex-m23
  cortex-m33

  cortex-a35
  cortex-a53
  cortex-a57

  Is it possible?
  Is it the right place to ask?
  Should I file separate requests for each?

  Thanks
