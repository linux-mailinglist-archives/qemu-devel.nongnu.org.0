agreed, it's confusing. But that would not allow to
  o = object_new()
  set props
  o.realize()
reuse the same plug handlers.

we potentially can convert it to device_add input arguments
and then call qdev_device_add() instead, which would then
handle plug handlers, not sure it's doable though.
Other than that I don't have any ideas how to make it less confusing.
