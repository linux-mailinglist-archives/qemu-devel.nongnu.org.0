with Q35 using ACPI PCI hotplug by default, user's request to unplug
device is ignored when it's issued before guest OS has been booted.
And any additional attempt to request device hot-unplug afterwards
results in following error:

  "Device XYZ is already in the process of unplug"

arguably it can be considered as a regression introduced by [2],
before which it was possible to issue unplug request multiple
times.

Allowing pending delete blocking expire brings ACPI PCI hotplug
on par with native PCIe unplug behavior [1] and allows user
to repeat unplug requests at propper times.
Set expire timeout to arbitrary 1msec so user won't be able to
flood guest with SCI interrupts by calling device_del in tight loop.

PS:
ACPI spec doesn't mandate what OSPM can do with GPEx.status
bits set before it's booted => it's impl. depended.
Status bits may be retained (I tested with one Windows version)
or cleared (Linux since 2.6 kernel times) during guest's ACPI
subsystem initialization.
Clearing status bits (though not wrong per se) hides the unplug
event from guest, and it's upto user to repeat device_del later
when guest is able to handle unplug requests.

1) 18416c62e3 ("pcie: expire pending delete")
2)
Fixes: cce8944cc9ef ("qdev-monitor: Forbid repeated device_del")

v2:
   * change timeout to 1ms
   * add comment to expire usage
   * massage commit message to be a bit more clear
