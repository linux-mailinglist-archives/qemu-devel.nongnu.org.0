There is complexity here, but I think it would also be present in the
buffer sharing device case. With a buffer sharing device, the same
identifying information would need to be provided from the exporting
driver to the buffer sharing driver, so the buffer sharing device
would be able to identify the right device in the vmm. And then in
both import cases, the buffer is just identified by some opaque bytes
that need to be given to a buffer manager in the vmm to resolve the
actual buffer.

Restricting access to actual exports could perhaps help catch bugs.
However, I don't think it provides any security guarantees, since the
guest can always just export every buffer before using it. Using
implicit addresses doesn't mean that the buffer import actually has to
be allowed - it can be thought of as fusing the buffer export and
buffer import operations into a single operation. The vmm can still
perform exactly the same security checks.

I don't think adding generic buffer management to virtio-gpu (or any
specific device type) is a good idea, since that device would then
become a requirement for buffer sharing between unrelated devices. For
example, it's easy to imagine a device with a virtio-camera and a
virtio-encoder (although such protocols don't exist today). It
wouldn't make sense to require a virtio-gpu device to allow those two
devices to share buffers.

Using uuids to identify buffers would work. The fact that it provides
a single way to refer to both guest and host allocated buffers is
nice. And it could also directly apply to sharing resources other than
buffers (e.g. fences). Although unless we're positing that there are
different levels of trust within the guest, I don't think uuids really
provides much security.

If we're talking about uuids, they could also be used to simplify my
proposed implicit addressing scheme. Each device could be assigned a
uuid, which would simplify the shared resource identifier to
(device-uuid, shmid, offset).

In my opinion, the implicit buffer addressing scheme is fairly similar
to the uuid proposal. As I see it, the difference is that one is
referring to resources as uuids in a global namespace, whereas the
other is referring to resources with fully qualified names. Beyond
that, the implementations would be fairly similar.
