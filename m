It looks like https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1814664 is a=20
similar description of the same problem: namely, if qemu is not able to=20
determine that the destination already reads as zero, then it forcefully=20
zeroes the destination of a backup job.  We may want to copy the fact=20
that qemu 5.0 is adding 'qemu-img convert --target-is-zero' to add a=20
similar knob to the QMP commands that trigger disk copying=20
(blockdev-backup, blockdev-mirror, possibly others) as well as logic to=20
avoid writing zeroes when the destination is already treated as zero=20
(whether by a probe, or by the knob being set).

For a local file, qemu is easily able to probe whether the destination=20
starts as all zeroes (thanks to lseek(SEEK_DATA));

whereas for s3fs, it looks like qemu does not have access to a quick=20
test to learn if the image starts all zero (POSIX does not provide a=20
quick way for doing this on a generic block device, but if you are aware=20
of an ioctl or otherwise that qemu could use, that might be helpful).=20
Or maybe the s3fs really is random contents rather than all zero, in=20
which case forcefully writing zeroes is the only correct behavior.
