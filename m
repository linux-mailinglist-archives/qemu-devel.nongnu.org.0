Yes.

Our rules.mak relies on this already.  It's full of magic, which
admittedly diminishes its suitability to serve as a good example.

Your worry might be rooted in old "=3D" burns.  "=3D" makes the variable
recursively expanded, and

    GENERATED_QGA_FILES =3D $(addprefix qga/qapi-generated/, $(GENERATED_QG=
A_FILES))

would be an infinite loop.  ":=3D" makes it simply expanded; there's not
even a loop, let alone an infinite one.  The GNU Make manual explains
this clearly at
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Flavors.html

Aside: there's a reason one of the two flavors is called "simple".  It
could additionally be called "not as slow".  One of my pet makefile
peeves: unthinking use of recursively expanded variables, complicating
semantics and slowing down builds.

Back to this patch.  I had started to write the thing in longhand, but
got tired of repeating qga/qapi-generated/, so I factored that out.
Would longhand be easier to understand?
