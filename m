I'm glad we can reach a consensus that ramfb needs sanity checks. And well,
I'm probably at fault with the hijacking.

Your QEMU/TCG in QEMU/TCG example also made me realize a deeper problem,
though: your setting still can't escape the host display / physical GPU
issue. The middle display layers be bochs or whatever, but as long as the
framebuffer content and resolution values are propagated, and the end
result is displayed at all on the host, the host GPU attack surface remains
exposed to the L2 guest, and checks are needed. Everything shown on the
screen involves the display driver - GPU stack, GTK or SDL or tty, you
can't avoid that. ramfb-kvmgt just happened to be the shortest pipeline
where every stage neglected the checks, which exposed this problem. Blaming
this on ramfb is unfair since in your scenario the checks are better done
in the display subsystems.

TL;DR You made me realize right now, it's a very real risk that an AARCH64
Windows guest could exploit a x64 host's display driver by specifying a
crafted framebuffer with overflowing resolution. I don't want to break it,
but I'd prefer a broken state over an insecure state.

I'm not quite sure what this thread is. But I think with the scope this
discussion is going, maybe it's more of a bug than a regression.

Component reuse is obviously *hugely* important, and it would be silly<br>
for me to argue against reusing ramfb wherever it applies. Just please<br>
don&#39;t break the original use case.<br>
<br>
Should I file a bug report in LaunchPad, or is this thread enough for<br>
tracking the QEMU regression?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn&#39;t have this problem. switching to &quot;serial&quot;=

&gt;&gt; Gerd contributed the OVMF QemuRamfbDxe driver in edk2 commit<br>
&gt;&gt; 1d25ff51af5c (&quot;OvmfPkg: add QemuRamfbDxe&quot;, 2018-06-14). =
Note the date:<br>
&gt;&gt; June 2018.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The then-latest (released) QEMU version was v2.12.0, and v2.12.1 /=
<br>
&gt;&gt; v3.0.0 were in the making.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; At that time, the resolution change definitely worked -- note my<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Tested-by&quot; on the edk2 commit message.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Running &quot;git blame&quot; on the QEMU source, I now find commi=
t a9e0cb67b7f4<br>
&gt;&gt; (&quot;hw/display/ramfb: lock guest resolution after it&#39;s set&=
quot;, 2019-05-24).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Again, note the date: May 2019 (and this commit was released with =
QEMU<br>
&gt;&gt; v4.1.0).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; So I would say that the symptom you see is a QEMU v4.1.0 regressio=
n. The<br>
&gt;&gt; QemuRamfbGraphicsOutputSetMode() function in the OVMF ramfb driver=
<br>
&gt;&gt; certainly needs the QemuFwCfgWriteBytes() call to work, for changi=
ng the<br>
&gt;&gt; resolution.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Now, I&#39;m not familiar with the reasons behind QEMU commit a9e0=
cb67b7f4.<br>
&gt;&gt; It says it intends to &quot;prevent[] a crash when the guest write=
s garbage<br>
&gt;&gt; to the configuration space (e.g. when rebooting)&quot;.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; But I don&#39;t understand why locking the resolution was necessar=
y for<br>
&gt;&gt; preventing &quot;a crash&quot;:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; (1) Registering a device reset handler in QEMU seems sufficient, s=
o that<br>
&gt;&gt; QEMU forget about the currently shared RAMFB area at platform rese=
t.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; (2) The crash in question is apparently not a *QEMU* crash -- whic=
h<br>
&gt;&gt; might otherwise justify a heavy-handed approach. Instead, it is a<=
br>
&gt;&gt; *guest* crash. See the references below:<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Therefore, I don&#39;t think that locking the resolution was justi=
fied!<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Importantly:<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - The QemuRamfbDxe driver allocates the framebuffer in *reserved*<=
br>
&gt;&gt; memory, therefore any well-behaving OS will *never* touch the<br>
&gt;&gt; framebuffer.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - The QemuRamfbDxe driver allocates the framebuffer memory only on=
ce,<br>
&gt;&gt; namely for such a resolution that needs the largest amount of<br>
&gt;&gt; framebuffer memory. Therefore, framebuffer re-allocations in the g=
uest<br>
&gt;&gt; driver -- and thereby guest RAM *re-mapping* in QEMU -- are *not*<=
br>
&gt;&gt; necessary, upon resolution change.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The ramfb device reset handler in QEMU is justified (for unmapping=
 /<br>
&gt;&gt; forgetting the previously shared RAMFB area).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The resolution locking is *NOT* justified, and it breaks the OVMF<=
br>
&gt;&gt; driver. I suggest backing out the resolution locking from QEMU.<br=
>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Reference (2a) above indicates &#39;It could be a misguided attemp=
t to<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;resize ramfb&quot; by the guest Intel driver&#39;. If that i=
s the case, then<br>
&gt;&gt; please fix the Intel guest driver, without regressing the QEMU dev=
ice<br>
&gt;&gt; model.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sad that the QEMU device model change was not regression-t=
ested<br>
&gt;&gt; against the *upstream* OVMF driver (which, by then, had been upstr=
eam<br>
&gt;&gt; for almost a year).<br>
