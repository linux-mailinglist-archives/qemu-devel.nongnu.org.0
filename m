Reliably ending the drain on a BDS's parents is quite difficult.  What
we have to achieve is to undrain exactly those parents that have been
added to the BDS while its quiesce_counter was elevated.  If we move
decrementing the quiesce_counter before the invocation of
bdrv_parent_drained_end(), that leaves us with the parents that existed
at the start of this function.  That seems simple enough, because new
parents are always added at the beginning of the list, so just iterating
through it from start to finish should give us exactly the parents we
are looking for.

Unfortunately, there is a catch.  Unquiescing one parent can lead to
another deciding to detach the child.  In the process, the BdrvChild
object may be destroyed.  That means using QLIST_FOREACH_SAFE() to
iterate the list is actually wrong: The @next pointer may be stale by
the time we get to the next iteration.  Using QLIST_FOREACH() would be
just as wrong, though, because the current BdrvChild object may be
destroyed just as well.

It follows that we cannot just iterate over the list from start to
finish.  Some ideas how to solve this problem:
- Store a list of the parent pointers at the beginning of the function,
  then try to unquiesce them all (as long as they are in bs->parents).
  Does not work because pointers may be reused by new parents.

- Add refcounts to BdrvChild objects.  Kind of silly because only the
  parent really has a valid reference.  Once that goes away, all fields
  must be cleared.  Therefore, all we could guarantee is that the list
  pointers (next/next_parent) stay valid.
  Also, parents can simply change the child a BdrvChild refers to.  If
  they do that, the BdrvChild object remains accessible, but (1) it
  refers to the wrong child, and (2) next_parent suddenly refers to a
  different list.
  So maybe this can be made to work, but it would always be kind of
  silly.

- Check the difference between the parent_quiesce_counters and the
  actual bs->quiesce_counter.  In theory, both should be equal after
  bdrv_parent_drained_end() (reduced by bdrv_drain_all_count for BDS
  parents).
  So we could reiterate the parent list (unquiescing one parent at a
  time) until all parents have the desired parent_quiesce_counter.
  In practice, this is difficult -- I have tried.  bdrv_drain_all_count
  may be one too high because somewhere down the stack there is a
  bdrv_drain_all_end() currently running.  Also, I suppose something can
  concurrently modify bs->quiesce_counter, and I am not sure how to
  handle such cases.
  In the best case, this would lead to rather complicated code that I
  could not trust but only pray that it works.  In the worst case, my
  prayers are not heard.

We can get around the whole issue by observing that it really does not
matter whether a parent is quiesced one time or ten.  We just have to
quiesce it once the moment the child tries to change from being
unquiesced to being quiesced.  We have to unquiesce it when the child is
unquiesced again.

Therefore, we can just make the parent_quiesce_counter a boolean and
call it parent_quiesced.  When bdrv_parent_drained_end() sees
bs->quiesce_counter going to 0, we unquiesce all parents.
bdrv_parent_drained_begin() in turn quiesces all unquiesced parents.

(This means we have to decrement bs->quiesce_counter before
bdrv_parent_drained_end().)
