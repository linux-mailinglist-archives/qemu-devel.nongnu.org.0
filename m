But if Bryce ever pushes a new version to his branch, the old SHA IDs
won't be part of a branch anymore, so they will be garbage collected
after a while and the links will become invalid. I think it's better to
refer to the "next-cube" branch.

Seems unused, indeed. I'll remove it.

I prefer the "0x" for bit-wise logical operations.

> or 0b11 :)

Hmm, does that work with all compiler versions that we currently
support? I remember it was not working with older versions of GCC...

Anyway, Bryce used 0x3 in his original code, so I'd like to keep it
close to his original code for the first commit. We can rework stuff
like this in later patches if we like, but for the initial commit, it
would be adequate that you can still recognize the original code, I think.

Should not matter much ... I think I'll also keep the original code here
for now.

No clue. But as you can see in nextfb_update() ("src_width = s->cols / 4
+ 8"), a line is a little bit wider than the visible 1120 pixels.

I don't know the Cube hardware that well ... so let's keep the original
values for now, we can still tune it later if necessary.

Where do you've got the information from that the VRAM region is aliased
a couple of times?

Ok, will do.

Thanks for the review!
