Hi Andrew,
Many thanks for the reply.

Got it. Many thanks for this info.

During virt machine init we take cpu type from (-cpu <cpu-type>)
option and it should apply evenly to all of the vcpus. Therefore,
I can assume all of the processors to be identical for now. This
combined with the KVM restriction you mentioned above means for
PMU we could only have Enable-for-All OR Enable-for-none config
for all of the vcpus being booted even though we at different
places do have per-vcpu specific check like below available

/* MADT */
static void
build_madt(GArray *table_data, BIOSLinker *linker, VirtMachineState *vms)
{
[...]

    for (i =3D 0; i < vms->smp_cpus; i++) {
        AcpiMadtGenericCpuInterface *gicc =3D acpi_data_push(table_data,
                                                           sizeof(*gicc));
        [...]

        if (arm_feature(&armcpu->env, ARM_FEATURE_PMU)) {---> This check
            gicc->performance_interrupt =3D cpu_to_le32(PPI(VIRTUAL_PMU_IRQ=
));
        }
 [...]
}

Do per-vcpu feature check for PMU even makes sense till we allow
heterogeneous support of processors or relax the PMU enablement
on the per-vcpu basis within the KVM?

sure. but in the existing code we do prematurely exit after we
discover first vcpu amongst the possible vcpus not supporting
PMU feature. This looks abnormal as well?

sure. so by default on latest machines PMU is on.=20

Will do. I have created one already. Will float soon.
