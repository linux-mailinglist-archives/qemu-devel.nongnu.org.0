Fair enough.

If I stop reading after the first paragraph, the patch matches
expectations built by the commit message.

If I speed-read, the first paragraph barely registers, but the second
makes me slow down, giving me the mistaken idea that this patch is about
converting to a preliminary style guide.  It's not, it's about getting
Sphinx errors out of the way.

I figure you didn't stop after the first paragraph because you felt a
need to explain why you resolve the "obvious errors" the way you do.

Perhaps:

    qapi: modify docstrings to be sphinx-compatible

    A precise style guide and a package-wide overhaul is forthcoming
    pending further discussion and consensus. For now, merely avoid
    obvious errors that cause Sphinx documentation build problems, using a
    style loosely based on PEP 257 and Sphinx Autodoc. It is chosen for
    interoperability with our existing Sphinx framework, and because it
    has loose recognition in the Pycharm IDE.

I recommend (but do not demand) to strictly limit this commit to
"avoiding obvious errors that cause sphinx documentation build
problems."

Got it.
