Ohhh... it isn't possible to initialize Qtest with machine specific
properties ? That's a bit unfortunate :-\

I'm okay with that since this patch doesn't bring much for the moment.

But soon, ie. linux-5.5 hopefully, KVM will allow to configure the number
of presenters in the XIVE and XICS-on-XIVE devices on POWER9. Combined
with this patch, it will allow to drastically reduce the consumption of
resources in the XIVE HW, which currently limits the number of VMs that
can run concurrently with an in-kernel irqchip. So I hope the 'make check'
you're willing to fix is worth it :-), and BTW you didn't answer David's
question about the test setup.
