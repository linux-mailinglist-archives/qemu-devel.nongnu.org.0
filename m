The need to maintain this list of functions makes me feel very
uneasy.

How can we have any confidence that this list of functions is
accurate ? How will maintainers ensure that they correctly update
it as they are writing/changing code, and how will they test the
result ?

It feels like it has the same general maint problem as the original
seccomp code we used, where we were never confident we had added
the right exceptions to let QEMU run without crashing when users
tickled some feature we forgot about.

Daniel
