Right. There are more relationships between features than "depends on",
such as "only if not" or "only if value is". The last one points out
that just setting the minimum feature value may not be sufficient to
control all the features. Also, there could be relationships involving
more than two features, such as 'a iff b and c', or 'a iff b and !c'.

We really have to take each feature of each ID register one at a time to
make sure we handle them appropriately. Exposing them all like this
without any checks just pushes all the pain onto the user to figure
everything out, and if there's not even errors generated, then how will
the user know when they got something wrong until their guest breaks
in some mysterious way?
