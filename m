This is a thing I wanted to do for a long time but never had time for.
I'm not sure whether that will change though.

We have a workaround for this tough: you can start the VM with CPUs
stopped:

virsh start --pause $VMNAME=20

(That translates to VIR_DOMAIN_START_PAUSED flag for
virDomainCreateWithFlags).

You can then use any libvirt API which requires a running VM including
blockjobs checkpoints etc.

The VM then can be destroyed. Since the CPUs didn't run the guest
visible image content was nott modified.

Alternatively to make this slightly more official we could introduce a
new flag for the VM starting API which will actually start the VM in the
no-machine mode, will interlock certain operations such as resuming of
the execution or migration perhaps  and the official purpose will be to
allow complex blockjobs without starting the actual VM.

Since starting an actual VM will be impossible anyways until such a VM
is gone it might be a sane thing to do here.

In libvirt we'd like to use it because qemu-img has no reasonable
progress reporting and we could reuse the code we have for interacting
with the jobs when the VM is running.

Well, dealing with corrupted bitmaps will be possible. I plan to expose
in the checkpoint XML whether a ckeckpoint is invalid (if it contains at
least one corrupted bitmap) and the user will have the option to delete
all previous checkpoints including the corrupted one to clear any
problem.

Note that deleting only the corrupted checkpoint will not be possible
until it's the oldest one as we attempt to merge them into the previous
ones. We could alternatively add a flag to skip merging of the invalid
checkpoint.
