device is put into 'unattached' in case it wasn't assigned a parent.
Usually it happens when board creates device directly.

theoretically device_del may use QOM path (the later users can get with query-hotpluggable-cpus),
but I think it's mostly debugging feature.

users are supposed to specify 'id' during -device/device_add if they are going to manage that device
afterwards (like unplugging it). Then they could use that 'id' in other commands (including device_del)

So 'id'-ed devices end up in 'peripheral' container

> 3. I could not see any device being place under *anonymous* container during init time. What is the use of this container?

if I recall it right, devices created with help of device_add but without 'id' go to this container
