This is not all that different from what we have today. eg QEMU exposes
several 100 devices impls, each with countless properties. Mgmt tools
like libvirt, or OpenStack/oVirt above don't support all these device
impls, nor do they support all the properties.

IOW, in many cases no configuration is exposed for many of the device
tunables, mgmt tools just rely on the machine type defaults for the
majority of them, and only do tuning for a relatively small subset.

So the machine type acts as a simplifying layer for the mgmt app,
enabling them to safely ignore majority of tunables, and only focus
on the small number of tunables they actually care about changing
or setting.

For a given type of device I expect there would be some core set of
config parameters that would have to be common to any impl, plus
some set of config params that are specific to just one impl.

If the mgmt app only cares about the core set of config params, then
we should ensure that they can do migration compatibility checks without
needing to care about all the extra irrelevant config params.

If apps want to use some parameters that are custom to specific dev
impls, then they'll have to have logic to expose those params, and
also logic to validate them on migration - if they are frontend ABI
sensitive config parameters, as opposed to backend only.

Is migrating between 2 different vendors' impls of the same core
device spec really a thing that's needed ?

From my POV, the key goal is that it should be possible to migrate
between two hosts without needing to check every single possible
config parameter that the device supports. It should only be neccessary
to check the parameters that are actually changed from their default
values. Then there just needs to be some simple string parameter that
encodes a particular set of devices, akin to the versioned machine
type.

Applications that want to migration between cross-vendor device impls
could opt-in to checking every single little parameter, but most can
just stick with a much simplified view where they only have to check
the parameters that they've actually overriden/exposed.

Daniel
