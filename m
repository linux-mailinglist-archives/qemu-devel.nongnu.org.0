With N800/N810 omap2plus_defconfig should be used instead. However,
I don't think that works either (but haven't tried recently). Also with
N800/N810 you need to append the DTB file to the kernel image.

Great!

A simple (but slow) way would be to start adding config options from
omap1_defconfig one by one to the working config, and see which one
makes it fail.

Using CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE it's possible to include a file system
inside the kernel image.

Based on your boot log, I think the kernel probably panics before the
MMC/sdcard is found (asynchronous probe). You could try adding rootwait
to the kernel command line. (My config has CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE=y, so
you need to add it to CONFIG_CMDLINE, as QEMU -append gets ignored). Also
the sdcard will appear as /dev/mmcblk0 instead of /dev/sda.

The sdcard is working fine for me, and it can be used to run a full-blown
distro rootfs; I don't know what is the capacity limit in the MMC driver
but at least 16 GB image is working fine:

[    2.011012] mmc0: new SDHC card at address 4567
[    2.016419] mmcblk0: mmc0:4567 QEMU! 16.0 GiB
