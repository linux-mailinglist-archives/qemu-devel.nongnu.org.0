I'm not sure why we would unconditionally flush all children anyway. The
only drivers I can think of that really need to flush more than one
child are blkverify and quorum, and both of them already implement this.
blkverify implements .bdrv_co_flush, so it's not affected by the change
anyway, but quorum children will be flushed twice now.

But more than this, I'm worried about the overhead of needlessly
recursing through the whole backing chain and calling flush on every
node there.  Maybe bs->write_gen saves us so that at least this doesn't
result in an fdatasync() call for each, but still... Without a use case,
I'd rather not do this.

Oh, well, after having written all of this, I see that qcow2 with an
external data file is buggy... This could be fixed in the qcow2 driver,
but maybe restricting the recursion to read-only is actually good enough
then. Can you mention this case in the commit message and maybe build a
test for it?
