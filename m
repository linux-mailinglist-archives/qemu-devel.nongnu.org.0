A backend driver that is specific for a guest device model (i.e. the
device model requires this driver, and the backend is useless without
the device) sounds like a very questionable design.

Metadata like OcssdFormatHeader that is considered part of the image
data, which means that the _actual_ image content without metadata isn't
directly accessible any more feels like a bad idea, too. Simple things
like what a resize operation means (change only the actual disk size as
usual, or is the new size disk + metadata?) become confusing. Attaching
an image to a different device becomes impossible.

The block format driver doesn't seem to actually add much functionality
to a specially crafted raw image: It provides a convenient way to create
such special images and it dumps some values in 'qemu-img info', but the
actual interpretation of the data is left to the device model.

Looking at the options it does provide, my impression is that these
should really be qdev properties, and the place to store them
persistently is something like the libvirt XML. The device doesn't
change any of the values, so there is nothing that QEMU actually needs
to store. What you invented is a one-off way to pass a config file to a
device, but only for one specific device type.

I think this needs to use a much more standard approach to be mergable.

Markus (CCed) as the maintainer for the configuration mechanisms may
have an opinion on this, too.

Doesn't bdrv_co_block_status() provide all the information you need for
that?
