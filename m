It appears I might be mistaken here. On IRC it was reported that
going back furrther to v5.1.0 shows good performance in Cirrus
still.

I had only gone back as far as 2a5a79d1b57280edd72193f6031de3feb682154e
which I thought was fast originally.

So somewhere between v5.1.0 and 2a5a79 we apparently regressed.

Daniel
