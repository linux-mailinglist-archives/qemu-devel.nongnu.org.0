TBH the plugin interfaces[1] are quite stable (have changed very
little), but:

 1) They're still part of the "avocado.core" namespace, which means
    the stability is a best effort, and not a promise/guarantee

 2) Most plugins make use of other "avocado.core" modules, which
    follow the same logic as #1

It's a known fact that it'd be good to have a supportable plugin
API[2], but we haven't had the resources to implement that.

Exactly, I think at this moment, this is the simple and best course of
action.
