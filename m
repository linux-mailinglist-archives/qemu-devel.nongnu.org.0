The need to maintain the state in a way that is robust
against backend disconnects and can be restored.

I'm not aware of big issues. What are they?

IIUC all vfio user does is add another protocol in the VMM,
and move code out of VMM to backend.

Architecturally I don't see why it's safer.

Something like multi-process patches seems like a way to
add defence in depth by having a process in the middle,
outside both VMM and backend.

The fact that vfio-user adds a kernel component is one issue.
