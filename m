Introducing a feature without

a) specification what it does
b) implementation (of both sides) showing what has to be done
c) any kind of documentation of what needs to be done

just horrible.

The latest-greatest spec lives in

https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec.git

I can't spot any signs of free page hinting/page poisioning. :(

We should document our result of page poisoning, free page hinting, and
free page reporting there as well. I hope you'll have time for the latter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semantics of VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

"The VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON feature bit is used to indicate if the
guest is using page poisoning. Guest writes to the poison_val config
field to tell host about the page poisoning value that is in use."
-> Very little information, no signs about what has to be done.

"Let the hypervisor know that we are expecting a specific value to be
written back in balloon pages."
-> Okay, that talks about "balloon pages", which would include right now
-- pages "inflated" and then "deflated" using free page hinting
-- pages "inflated" and then "deflated" using oridnary inflate/deflate
   queue
-- pages "inflated" using free page reporting and automatically
   "deflated" on access

So VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON really means "whenever the guest
deflates a page (either explicitly, or implicitly with free page
reporting), it is filled with "poison_val".

And I would add

"However, if the inflated page was not filled with "poison_val" when
inflating, it's not predictable if the original page or a page filled
with "poison_val" is returned."

Which would cover the "we did not discard the page in the hypervisor, so
the original page is still there".


We should also document what is expected to happen if "poison_val" is
suddenly changed by the guest at one point in time again. (e.g., not
supported, unexpected things can happen, etc.) Also, we might have to
document that a device reset resets the poison_val to 0. (not sure if
that's really necessary)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What we have to do in the guest/Linux:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A guest which relies on this (esp., free page reporting in Linux only,
right?), has to not use/advertise VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING *in case
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON is not provided* by the host. AFAIKS,
ordinary inflation/deflation and free page hinting does currently not
care, as we go via free_page(), so that is currently fine AFAIKs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What we have to do in the hypervisor/QEMU:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON, we could provide free page reporting
easily IFF "page_val"=3D=3D0. However, as you said, it will currently be
expensive in case of postcopy, as the guest still zeroes out all pages.
Document that properly.

With VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON, don't inflate any pages right now
(not discarding anything), OR fill the pages with poison_val when
deflating. I guess the latter would be better - even if current Linux
does not need it, it's what we are expected to do AFAIKS.

With VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON and page_val !=3D 0, discard all free
page reporting attempts. (=3D=3D what your patch #3 does). Document that
properly.


Makes sense? See below for guest migration thingies.

If the guest agrees to have VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON but does not
initialize poison_val, then it's a guest bug, I wouldn't worry about
that for now.

Yeah, we have to migrate poison_val from source to destination. Also, we
should worry about us losing the page poisoning feature when migrating
from source to destination.

Thinking about it, it might make sense to completely decouple page
poisoning here. Assign it a separate property (as you did), default
enable it, but disable it via QEMU compat machines.

Then, we won't lose the feature when migrating.
