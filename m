Please don't.  Let me explain.

QemuOpts has always permitted multiple keys, last one wins.
key=3D1,key=3D2,key=3D3 means key=3D3.  Permits things like overriding sett=
ings
read from a configuration file on the command line.

The straightforward way to use QemuOpts lets the last one win:
qemu_opt_set() & friends insert at the end of the tail queue,
qemu_opt_find() searches backwards for a match.

Its storing of duplicates may have been just an implementation artifact
initially, but then some "clever" uses were invented.  These work by
iterating over all QemuOpts parameters with qemu_opt_foreach(), or over
all parameters of a certain name with qemu_opt_iter_init() and
qemu_opt_iter_next().

What the iterating ones all do is anybody's guess.

A common use is collecting all values.  This presses key repetition into
list service: key=3D1,key=3D2,key=3D3 is interpreted like key: [1, 2, 3].

Abusing iteration to honor the first one instead of the last one would
be disgusting.  I'm not aware of such a user, but I'm also not betting
my own money on absence of such abuse.

Needless to say, the peculiarities of QemuOpts are all ABI by now.
Doesn't mean we cannot change them, only that changes need to be
deliberate and careful.

>> But anyway, I figure the same problem exists for almost all options.

It's a feature, not a problem :)
