Hi, Laurent,

"Hello world" was taken as an example where code generation is
dominant. It was taken to illustrate how performance-wise code
generation overhead is distributed (illustrating dominance of a
single function).

While "Hello world" by itself is not a significant example, it conveys
a useful information: it says how much is the overhead of QEMU
linux-user executable initialization, and code generation spent on
emulation of loading target executable and printing a simple
message. This can be roughly deducted from the result for
a meaningful benchmark.

Booting of a virtual machine is a legitimate scenario for measuring
performance, and perhaps even attempting improving it.

Everything should be measured - code generation, JIT-ed code
execution, and helpers execution - in all cases, and checked
whether it departs from expected behavior.

Let's say that we emulate a benchmark that basically runs some
code in a loop, or an algorithm - one would expect that after a
while, while increasing number of iterations of the loop, or the
size of data in the algorithm, code generation becomes less and
less significant, converging to zero. Well, this should be confirmed
with an experiment, and not taken for granted.

I think limiting measurements only on, let's say, execution of
JIT-ed code (if that is what you implied) is a logical mistake.
The right conclusions should be drawn from the complete
picture, shouldn't it?

Yours,
Aleksandar
