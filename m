I'm still trying to track down a BE system.  Everything I have which is
newer than POWER7 is LE, and POWER7 is not sufficient to run the test.

The test suite that produced the problem is from https://github.com
/open-power-sdk/pveclib.  The good news is that with your (v1) changes,
275 tests no longer fail.  22 tests still fail, but I bet it is
different issue(s).

Title:
  instruction 'denbcdq' misbehaving

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Instruction 'denbcdq' appears to have no effect.  Test case attached.

  On ppc64le native:
  --
  gcc -g -O -mcpu=3Dpower9 bcdcfsq.c test-denbcdq.c -o test-denbcdq
  $ ./test-denbcdq
  0x00000000000000000000000000000000

  0x22080000000000000000000000000080
  --

  With "qemu-ppc64le -cpu power9"
  --
  $ qemu-ppc64le -cpu power9 -L [...] ./test-denbcdq

  I started looking at the code, but I got confused rather quickly.
  Could be related to endianness? I think denbcdq arrived on the scene
  before little-endian was a big deal.  Maybe something to do with
  utilizing implicit floating-point register pairs...  I don't think the
  right data is getting to helper_denbcdq, which would point back to the
  gen_fprp_ptr uses in dfp-impl.inc.c (GEN_DFP_T_FPR_I32_Rc).  (Maybe?)
