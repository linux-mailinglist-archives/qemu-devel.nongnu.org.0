Sufficiently so that the watchdog timer resets the system. When it happens, all the secondary threads are in stopped state, only the main thread is working. That's how I was reproducing.

If the primary thread is the same as before, then there's no problem. If it's a different primary, then it will enter main_cpu_entry() while the other threads wait as secondaries. At some point, the primary thread (which still carries the wrong resume_as_sreset value from before reset) will enable the decrementer interrupt. The vector for the decrementer exception 0x900 is defined, so that shouldn't be a problem. However, because of the wrong resume_as_sreset value, it is re-routed to vector 0x100, which is still defined as the default boot-time handler, which is the entry point for BML. So the thread restarts as new, but this time it will be elected secondary. And we end up with all threads waiting as secondaries and a system stuck. All that happen before we've init the uart, so there's not a single trace on the console.

Great analysis !

I think this deserve a v2 just to put in the commit log what you
just wrote :)

Thanks,
