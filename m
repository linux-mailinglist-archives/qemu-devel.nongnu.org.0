That=E2=80=99s a good point.

Possible.  Maybe it turns out that at least for this series I don=E2=80=99=

bdrv_storage_child() at all.

Hm.  It feels like something that should be done before this series,
actually.

So I think we should add at least a child role per child access function
so that they match?  And then maybe in bdrv_attach_child() assert that a
BDS never has more than one primary or filtered child (a filtered child
acts as a primary child, too), or more than one COW child.  (And that
these are always in bs->file or bs->backing so the child access
functions do work.)
