Hi guys,

Sorry for the delay...

So first ill clarify what was the test, the test was to see the device
"Microsoft Hyper-V Virtual Machine Bus" in Windows Device Manager under
"System devices" with a state of "working properly".

It seems like it's ok to drop all the _PS* and _STA.

It seems to be functioning with single IRQ as well, it is worth noting 
that even when i dropped the entire _CRS (so no IRQs resources are 
required, the device was still showing that it's functioning, but I 
suspect this might affect the child devices like hv-net and hv-scsi).

With that said I did run into a small issue I set-up Win10 1903 (aka 
19H1) and it seems like VMBus now requires to have the following 
features enabled:
HV_VP_RUNTIME_AVAILABLE
HV_TIME_REF_COUNT_AVAILABLE
HV_SYNIC_AVAILABLE
HV_SYNTIMERS_AVAILABLE
HV_APIC_ACCESS_AVAILABLE
HV_HYPERCALL_AVAILABLE
HV_VP_INDEX_AVAILABLE

So notice that previously only SYNIC and VPINDEX was needed, now you 
need the whole thing so you need to run qemu with something like
-cpu host,hv-relaxed,hv_spinlocks=0x1fff,hv_time,hv-vapic,hv-vpindex,hv-synic,hv-runtime,hv-stimer

The validation was done in winhv!WinHvpCheckPartitionPrivileges .

Paolo I noticed you have done a PULL request, would you like to wait on 
it and we will submit a version with a single IRQ (selectable by user 
property) and go with Igor's suggestion dropping _PS* and _STA (though 
like I said before I prefer to mimic the original HyperV with it's 
bugs, but I'll leave this decision to you).

Also today VMBus only verifies SYNIC is enabled I'm not sure how but I 
wonder if we want to some how exports from the CPU which other HV 
features are enabled so we can verify all the required ones are set, 
would appreciate if you have any suggestions here.

Cheers,
-- Jon.
