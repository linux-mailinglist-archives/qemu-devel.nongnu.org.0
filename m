I forgot to mention in my previous reply, I feel like the ability
to finish the configure -> meson conversion is a pretty compelling
motivation to adopt the new meson. The hybrid configure/meson
state we've been in has worked better than I expected it would
at first, but none the less, the more we can get out of configure
the better it will be for ongoing maint burden.

So yes, its shiny new features, but they're pretty compelling
features as they allow us to finish the job we started. We've
clear precedent all over QEMU codebase that half-finished
conversions harm our ability to maintain the project.

With regards,
Daniel
