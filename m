Migrating an existing code base to C++ object, I agree.

In the absolute, however, the boilerplate code is clearly
another level of complexity in qom or gobject. And I don=E2=80=99t
think it=E2=80=99s particularly hard to add dynamic properties to a
Object class either, including in a form that would call the
existing C functions.

Agree with that.

Good point. But C++ has tools to solve that. Please see my response
to Paolo.
