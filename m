So, I read your email before going on PTO and at that point I got what
your concerns were, but now after re-reading it I don't understand
anymore what you mean :)

This can be fixed: patch 4 "bdrv_child_try_change_aio_context: add
transaction parameter" supports taking transaction as a parameter.
bdrv_attach_child_common could simply call
bdrv_try_change_aio_context_tran (ok we need to deal with locking, but
it could work).

I think the main concern here is that during the prepare phase this
serie doesn't change any aiocontext, so until we don't commit the rest
of the code cannot assume that the aiocontext has been changed.

But isn't it what happens also for permissions? Permission functions
like bdrv_drv_set_perm perform bdrv_check_perm() in .prepare(), and then
bdrv_set_perm() in commit.

Another important question is that if we actually want to put everything
in a single transaction, because .prepare functions like the one
proposed here perform drains, so the logic following prepare and
preceding commit must take into account that everything is drained. Also
prepare itself has to take into account that maybe other .prepare took
locks or drained themselves...
