Here is the exact working command line I used for Windows 95C (OSR2.5):

qemu-system-i386 -cpu pentium -m 128 -vga std -no-kvm -hda
~/Win95C.qcow2 -nodefaults -no-hpet -no-acpi -nodefaults -monitor stdio
-sdl -boot menu=3Don,order=3Dc,splash-time=3D2000 -accel tcg,thread=3Dsingle

To install the OS I simply added -cdrom and -fda, but everything else
stayed the same.

This was using the latest master (33f18cf, after v4.1.0) and its
included bios binaries.

Title:
  Windows 95 and Windows 98 will not install or run

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  The last version of QEMU I have been able to run Windows 95 or Windows
  98 on was 2.7 or 2.8. Recent versions since then even up to 3.1 will
  either not install or will not run 95 or 98 at all. I have tried every
  combination of options like isapc or no isapc, cpu pentium  or cpu as
  486. Tried different memory configurations, but they just don't work
  anymore.
