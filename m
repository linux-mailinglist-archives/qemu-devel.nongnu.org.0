Ok, and those setprops happen before CAS?

In a sense this is kind of a fundamental problem with rebuilding the
whole DT at CAS time.  Except that strictly speaking it's a problem
even without that: we just get away with it by accident because CAS
isn't likely to change the same things that guest setprops do.

It's still basically unsynchronized mutations by two parties to a
shared data structure.

Hm, right.
