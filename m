Jim, Aleksandar Rikalo, the author of the patch was about to send Laurent
explanation why this aproach is needed in its current organization, on a
very similar line of reasoning as yours.

I am waiting on him to send a new version of the series. Meanwhile you can
send strace patch to the list, and I can even incude it in my series after
and together with Aleksandar's patch, if you don't object.

Yours,

Aleksandar M.
