You're right in that backward compatibility is not a convincing argument
for stuff that has no known productive uses, and is bonkers to boot.

Fair enough.

However,

(1) is_valid_option_list()'s and opts_do_parse()'s parse of "a,b,,help"
    are equidistant from keyval_parse()'s:

    opts_do_parse() splits it into four parts:

        "a"     (desugared to a=3Don)
        "b"     (desugared to b=3Don)
        ""      (desugared to =3Don)
        "help"  (desugared to help=3Don)

    has_help_option() splits it into two:

        "a"
        "b,help"

    keyval_parse() fails:

        Expected '=3D' after parameter 'a'

    If I it implemented boolean sugar, then it would fail at the third
    comma, just like ",help" fails now:

        Invalid parameter ''

    Fails because ",help" does not start with a valid name.

    Thus, the answer to the question which of the two functions covered
    by the test are wrong would be "both".

(2) This series tries hard not to write QemuOpts parsing code.  It
    throws away QemuOpts parsing code.
