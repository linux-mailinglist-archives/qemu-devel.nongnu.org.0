You already have a timestamp, though I'm not sure if it is one that is
appropriate to report to a user.

I was thinking that you would include both the start time and duration
of the sample in the output of the query-dirty-rate QMP command, as well
as the dirty rate itself. That way the caller can make a decision about
whether the data is useful.

Sorry, I didn't understand this comment.
