Hi Paolo, hmm,

in my view the wrapper should not be "replay_" though,
what about block_bh_schedule_oneshot_event, for example, where we would move the "if replay is built-in and enabled" logic from the replay framework?

Also interesting note, replay code hooks all aio_bg_schedule_oneshot in block, with the exception of:

nbd.c
export/export.c

Is this wanted?

Ciao,

Claudio
