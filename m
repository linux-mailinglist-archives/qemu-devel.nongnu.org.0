Yes, it's per thread.  The state can be built from
capng_clear/capng_get_caps_process + capng_update, and left in there
forever.  There is also capng_save_state/capng_restore_state which, as
far as I can see from the sources, can be used across threads.

Ok, then perhaps you can take a look at my virtfs-proxy-helper patch.
The important part is that after setresuid/setresgid PERM=EFF if
uid=0/gid=0 and PERM=0 otherwise.
