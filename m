Why?

Okay, I checked the code.  Since the devices in question don't get a
composition tree parent assigned, realize puts them in the
/machine/unattached orphanage.  The canonical path is something like
"/machine/unattached/device[6]", which is less than clear.

The components of the canonical path are the names of the QOM child
properties.  object_get_canonical_path_component() returns the last one,
in this case "device[6]".

If we made the devices QOM children of some other device, we could name
the child properties "pca0" and "pca1".
object_get_canonical_path_component() would then return the strings you
want to see.

We make a device a QOM child of some QOM parent device only if the child
is a component device of the parent (hence the name "composition
tree").

Are these devices integral components of something else, or are they
separate chips?

Personally, I'd be content with i2c bus and address for debugging
purposes.

The i2c buses *are* components: canonical paths look like
"/machine/soc/i2c/aspeed.i2c.3".  The combination of
object_get_canonical_path_component(dev) and
object_property_get_uint(dev, "address", &error_abort) identifies any
i2c device on this machine, not just the two you decorate with a
description string.
