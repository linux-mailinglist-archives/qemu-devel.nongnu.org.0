Hi Philippe,

I've checked and yes, I can make time to review patches.
This is part of my current paid work, so when my contract eventually ends I=
 will likely have to step down as reviewer.
I'll have notice of that happening some time before, so I can pass that alo=
ng when it comes.

This message comes from my work email so the details should be correct, i.e=
. Sarah Harris <S.E.Harris@kent.ac.uk>

Kind regards,
Sarah Harris
