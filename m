As far as I know it, modern intel's cpus support so called unrestricted guest mode, which allows guest to be basically in any mode,
as long as EPT paging is used (that is guest can be in real mode with
no paging, but EPT has to be enabled).
The 'vm86_active' is probably lefover support for cpus that don't support EPT and/or the unrestricted guest mode,
where KVM tried to use the good old vm86 mode to
for real mode virtualization.

Same as above

EPT sits underneath the guest's paging mode, which in case of real mode is 1:1 mapping.
Thus CS<<4 + IP would be the guest physical address and it will be looked up in the EPT to translate to the real physical address.
