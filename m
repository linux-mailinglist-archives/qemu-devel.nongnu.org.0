Cool, that commit is a very good staring point - it is definitely not too
simple, and it is not too complex either. And you can discover several
different concepts in the process of exploring the change.

Documentation on instruction set extension related to the commit (found by
Google):
https://files.somniafabularum.com/loongson/docs/Loongson2FUserGuide.pdf

Be persistent, take your time, study the details and handling of individual
instructions, and, of course, let us know if you encounter some major
obstacles or thorny dilemmas.

Yours,
Aleksandar
