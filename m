I think I'm going to stick with the gross TARGET for now. It mostly
seems a way of avoiding building per-arch plugins. I assume most out of
tree plugins will be targeted at a specific machine anyway.

Anyway I think that means I'll drop this series unless 1-3 are worth
keeping as simple clean-ups leaving out 4?
