Title:
  qemu-system-ppc64 smp crash on manual reset

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Host Environment:
     x86_64 Linux v5.0.2
     QEMU emulator version 4.0.50 (v4.0.0-354-g812b835fb4)
     SLOF:
         Build Date =3D Jan 14 2019 18:00:39
         FW Version =3D git-a5b428e1c1eae703

  Problem: Qemu crash immediately after a manual reset
           (this is not the initial reset which launches the guest).

  Steps:

  1. Download Debian ppc64el mini.iso:
     http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/sid/main/installer-ppc64el/current/=
images/netboot/mini.iso
  2. Run qemu on the host. Ensure that it runs with more than one CPUs. Wit=
h a single CPU, I was unable
     to reproduce the crash.
     qemu-system-ppc64 -M pseries -cpu power9 -smp 2 -m 512 -cdrom mini.iso
  3. SLOF prints the version info on the serial device, and proceeds to boo=
t.
  4. After a few seconds, the GRUB menu appears on the VGA screen.
  5. Select one of the install options (I have tested with Default and Expe=
rt), and wait
     for the Debian's text-mode installer (blue-gray-red) screen to appear.
  6. Click Machine->Reset (or enter system_reset on the qemu monitor).
  7. Notice that, on the serial device, SLOF has printed the version info. =
That is, the system
     has reset and is attempting to boot again.
  8. On the host cmd prompt, qemu dies after printing this fatal error and =
spewing the
     contents of the CPU registers:

     qemu: fatal: Trying to deliver HV exception (MSR) 70 with no HV support
     <CPU contents> (See attached out.txt for details)
     Aborted (core dumped)

  =

  The HV exception is either
     (a) 70 =3D HISI, which occurs when NIP contains an outright bogus or i=
naccessible value, or
     (b) 69 =3D HDSI, which occurs when NIP happens to contain a somewhat s=
aner value, and
         the cpu attempts to run the instruction at that address.

  The exception can occur on either of the CPUs. It occurs when qemu is run=
ning the SLOF
  code.
