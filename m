This (undefined content) is generally what guests should expect when a
write request returns an error.

It certainly means that you can't continue as if nothing had happened.

However, writing to the same area again (and successfully) restores a
valid state, so with werror=stop you would get into a state where you
can later reconnect and continue where you stopped, but the monitor
would stay responsive during that time.

Or if the disk isn't critical for the guest, you could replace the NBD
block node with a node that always returns I/O errors, so the guest
would see a broken disk (actually, just reporting the errors from
yanking to the guest might be enough to make it give up on the disk and
stop sending new requests). Then you can resume the VM right away.
