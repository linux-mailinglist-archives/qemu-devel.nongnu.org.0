Paolo and Richard objected to deprecating -netdev bridge, so that's out,
too.

Proposal:

1. Add qemu-bridge-helper.c to Jason's "Network device backends"

2. Deprecate -netdev tap parameter "helper"

3. Improve documentation of -netdev bridge

4. Create a manual page for qemu-bridge-helper that also covers
   /etc/qemu/bridge.conf.

5. Fix the nutty error handling in parse_acl_file()

Objections?
