Ok, I can see the value in that.  I guess the way I'd prefer to
approach it though, is to start out with just a single-value enum for
(roughly) a cold reset.  Then when we find a subset of devices for
which we can consistently define a warm reset of some type, we add an
enum value for it.

I guess we'd also need some way of introspecting what reset types are
supported by a device.
