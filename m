Yes, the discussion about type annotations is what made me check whether
we could do 3.6, because if we want to make use of type checking, we'll
need it for both functions and variables to get reasonable results.

And actually, we currently don't have any Python tests in the auto
group, so the only effect is for people manually running ./check on
Debian oldstable. I'm not sure, but I suspect this might be the empty
set.
