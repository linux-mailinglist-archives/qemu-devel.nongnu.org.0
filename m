I had a go on this one; you still get EPERM when trying to 
pthread_mutex_unlock() from a forked child process on a 
PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK mutex locked by parent process.

The common opinion though seems to be that unlocking parent's lock(s) by child 
process was illegal:

https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2745

The relevant section from POSIX:

	fork - create a new process
	...
	A process shall be created with a single thread. If a multi-threaded 
	process calls fork(), the new process shall contain a replica of the 
	calling thread and its entire address space, possibly including the states 
	of mutexes and other resources. Consequently, to avoid errors, the child 
	process may only execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as 
	one of the exec functions is called.
