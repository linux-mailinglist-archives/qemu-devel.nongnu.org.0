I'm not sure how this could work. If QEMU reports (via ID regs
etc) to the guest that it supports instruction class X when it
does not, that's a bug and we should fix it. If QEMU implements
an instruction but gets it wrong, that's also a bug and we should
fix it. In both cases, we'd need to have specific bug reports,
ideally with reproduce-cases. But we don't really have "known
areas where the emulation is incorrect" that we could somehow
differentiate and disable (except at a very vague level, eg
"probably better not to rely on the x86 emulation").

You might be able by careful selection of the cpu type to avoid
CPUs which implement vector operations. Some architectures
also allow individual CPU features to be disabled with extra
'-foo' qualifiers on the -cpu argument.

For Arm in particular (32 or 64 bit) I believe our implementation
should be correct and am happy to look at bug reports for that.

thanks

Bug description:
  While qemu's scalar emulation tends to be excellent, qemu's SIMD
  emulation tends to be incorrect (except for arm64 from x86_64)--i have
  found this both for mipsel and arm32. Until these code paths are
  audited, which is probably a large job, it would be nice if qemu knew
  its emulation of this class of instructions was not very good, and
  thus it would give up on finding these instructions if a "careful"
