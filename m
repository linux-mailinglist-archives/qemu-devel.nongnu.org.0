Public bug reported:

In target/i386/seg_helper.c:switch_tss_ra() we have the following code
to load registers from a 16-bit TSS struct:

        /* 16 bit */
        new_cr3 =3D 0;
        new_eip =3D cpu_lduw_kernel_ra(env, tss_base + 0x0e, retaddr);
        new_eflags =3D cpu_lduw_kernel_ra(env, tss_base + 0x10, retaddr);
        for (i =3D 0; i < 8; i++) {
            new_regs[i] =3D cpu_lduw_kernel_ra(env, tss_base + (0x12 + i * =
2),
                                             retaddr) | 0xffff0000;
        }
        for (i =3D 0; i < 4; i++) {
            new_segs[i] =3D cpu_lduw_kernel_ra(env, tss_base + (0x22 + i * =
4),
                                             retaddr);
        }
        new_ldt =3D cpu_lduw_kernel_ra(env, tss_base + 0x2a, retaddr);

This doesn't match up with the structure described here:
https://www.sandpile.org/x86/tss.htm -- which has only 2-byte slots for
the segment registers. It also makes the 3rd segreg use the same offset
as the LDTR, which is very suspicious. I suspect that this should use
"(0x22 + i * 2)".

The code later in the same function that stores the segment registers to
the struct has the same bug.

Found by code inspection; I don't have a test case to check this. As a
non-x86-expert I'm just going to file a bug report in case somebody else
feels like confirming the issue and sending a patch.
