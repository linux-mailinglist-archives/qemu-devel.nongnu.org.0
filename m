Hello,

The Radix tree translation model currently supports process-scoped
translation for the PowerNV machine (Hypervisor mode) and for the
pSeries machine (Guest mode). Guests running under an emulated
Hypervisor (PowerNV machine) require a new type of Radix translation,
called partition-scoped, which is missing today.

The Radix tree translation is a 2 steps process. The first step,
process-scoped translation, converts an effective Address to a guest
real address, and the second step, partition-scoped translation,
converts a guest real address to a host real address.

There are difference cases to covers :=20

* Hypervisor real mode access: no Radix translation.

* Hypervisor or host application access (quadrant 0 and 3) with
  relocation on: process-scoped translation.

* Guest OS real mode access: only partition-scoped translation.

* Guest OS real or guest application access (quadrant 0 and 3) with
  relocation on: both process-scoped translation and partition-scoped
  translations.

* Hypervisor access in quadrant 1 and 2 with relocation on: both
  process-scoped translation and partition-scoped translations.

The radix tree partition-scoped translation is performed using tables
pointed to by the first double-word of the Partition Table Entries and
process-scoped translation uses tables pointed to by the Process Table
Entries (second double-word of the Partition Table Entries).

Both partition-scoped and process-scoped translations process are
identical and thus the radix tree traversing code is largely reused.
However, errors in partition-scoped translations generate hypervisor
exceptions.

Based on work from Suraj Jitindar Singh <sjitindarsingh@gmail.com>

Thanks,

C.

Changes since v1:

 - removed checks (cpu->vhyp && lpid =3D=3D 0)
 - changed ppc_radix64_walk_tree() and ppc_radix64_next_level() to use
   an 'AddressSpace *'
 - moved call to ppc_radix64_get_fully_qualified_addr() under
   ppc_radix64_xlate()
 - reworked the prototype of the routines raising the exceptions to
   take a 'cause_excp' bool.
 - re-introduced an extra test on nls in ppc_radix64_walk_tree()

C=C3=A9dric Le Goater (4):
  target/ppc: Introduce ppc_radix64_xlate() for Radix tree translation
  target/ppc: Extend ppc_radix64_check_prot() with a 'partition_scoped'
    bool
  target/ppc: Rework ppc_radix64_walk_tree() for partition-scoped
    translation
  target/ppc: Add support for Radix partition-scoped translation
