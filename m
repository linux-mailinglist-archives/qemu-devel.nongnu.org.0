Ah, true, I was thinking of external hardware fault triggered MCEs
rather than software error ones like duplicate SLB.

That said, I strongly suspect TCG is buggy enough at present that
exact behaviour in rare error conditions like duplicate SLB is not
really a big problem in the scheme of things.

I really don't think we can enable this by default until we allow it
for TCG - we don't want starting a TCG guest to involve manually
switching other options.

We could consider allowing it for TCG but just printing a warning that
the behaviour may not be correct in some conditions - we do something
similar for some of the Spectre workarounds already.
