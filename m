Title:
  It's not possible to start a VM with a network cable unplugged

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  There should be a command line (sub)option to unplug a network cable.
  While from the monitor interface I can issue:

  set_link virtio-net-pci.0 off

  There's no way to fire a VM from command line with that cable already unp=
lugged.
  As an example, virtualbox can do it.
