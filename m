Ok. No problem.

Ah. I haven't looked into this yet. Will do that for the next

Well, I need to displace the breakpoint somehow. I don't think I can
handle this particular case without having _some_ knowledge of the
handler's code. The ones I've seen so far don't have a branch as first
instruction.

This is the call chain:

kvm_arch_insert_sw_breakpoint -> cpu_memory_rw_debug ->
cpu_get_phys_page_attrs_debug -> ppc_cpu_get_phys_page_debug ->
ppc64_v3_get_phys_page_debug -> ppc_radix64_get_phys_page_debug:

    /* Handle Real Mode */
    if (msr_dr == 0) {
        /* In real mode top 4 effective addr bits (mostly) ignored */
        return eaddr & 0x0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
    }


Actually, I think there is a bug after ppc_cpu_get_phys_page_debug
somewhere. There are some cases where GDB wants to read/write to some
memory, but it gets denied access. Presumably because of one such
discrepancy as the one above. I need to spend more time looking at this
to define the problem properly, though.

I understand from the ISA that for the purposes of AIL, both bits need
to be set. So mmu_on = 0 is correct here.

Hm. I had this in some previous version but removed it for some
reason. I'll review it.
