From: Vladimir Sementsov-Ogievskiy <vsementsov@virtuozzo.com>

Introduce an API for some shared splittable resource, like memory.
It's going to be used by backup. Backup uses both read/write io and
copy_range. copy_range may consume memory implictly, so the new API is
abstract: it doesn't allocate any real memory but only hands out
tickets.

The idea is that we have some total amount of something and callers
should wait in coroutine queue if there is not enough of the resource
at the moment.
