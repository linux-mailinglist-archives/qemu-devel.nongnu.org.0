This version, like the previous one, tries to fix an issue found by
David Gibson when running the Travis CI:

Unexpected error in qdev_prop_set_after_realize() at /home/travis/build/dgibson/qemu/hw/core/qdev-properties.c:30:
qemu-system-mips64el: Attempt to set property 'start-powered-off' on anonymous device (type 'I6400-mips64-cpu') after it was realized
Broken pipe
/home/travis/build/dgibson/qemu/tests/qtest/libqtest.c:175: kill_qemu() detected QEMU death from signal 6 (Aborted) (core dumped)
Aborted (core dumped)
ERROR qom-test - too few tests run (expected 8, got 0)
/home/travis/build/dgibson/qemu/tests/Makefile.include:650: recipe for target 'check-qtest-mips64el' failed

Philippe Mathieu-Daudé spotted the problem:

> Good catch. hw/mips/cps.c, hw/ppc/e500.c and hw/sparc/sun4m.c are
> incorrectly setting the property after the cpu is realized because
> the cpu is created with cpu_create(). We need to create them with
> object_initialize_child() and realize them manually with qdev_realize().

But I found very few examples of CPUs initialized with
object_initialize_child() (e.g., atmega.c, rx62n.c, nrf51_soc.c)
so instead of using object_initialize_child(), I replaced the call to
cpu_create() with object_new() and a call to qdev_realize() shortly after
the  start-powered-off property is set. I thought this would be the more
prudent change, keeping the code as close to the previous one as possible.

I tried reproducing the Travis CI problem with
`make docker-test-misc@debian-mips64el-cross` but I didn't succeed, so
I'm not sure if this version solves the issue.

Applies cleanly on dgibson/ppc-for-5.2.

Original cover letter below, followed by changelog:


The ARM code has a start-powered-off property in ARMCPU, which is a
subclass of CPUState. This property causes arm_cpu_reset() to set
CPUState::halted to 1, signalling that the CPU should start in a halted
state. Other architectures also have code which aim to achieve the same
effect, but without using a property.

The ppc/spapr version has a bug where QEMU does a KVM_RUN on the vcpu
before cs->halted is set to 1, causing the vcpu to run while it's still in
an unitialized state (more details in patch 3).

Peter Maydell mentioned the ARM start-powered-off property and
Eduardo Habkost suggested making it generic, so this patch series does
that, for all cases which I was able to find via grep in the code.

The only problem is that I was only able to test these changes on a ppc64le
pseries KVM guest, so except for patches 2 and 3, all others are only
build-tested. Also, my grasp of QOM lifecycle is basically non-existant so
please be aware of that when reviewing this series.

The last patch may be wrong, as pointed out by Eduardo, so I marked it as
RFC. It may make sense to drop it.

Changes since v4:

Patch "ppc/e500: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
Patch "sparc/sun4m: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Use qdev_realize_and_unref() instead of qdev_realize(), as suggested
  by Igor.
- Pass &error_fatal to qdev_realize_and_unref() instead of manually
  reporting the error and exiting QEMU, as suggested by Philippe.
- Changed object_property_set_bool() to use &error_fatal instead of
  &error_abort.

Patch "mips/cps: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Use qdev_realize_and_unref() instead of qdev_realize(), as suggested
  by Igor.
- Use existing errp argument to propagate error back to the caller, as
  suggested by Philippe.
- Changed object_property_set_bool() to use existing errp argument to
  propagate error back to the caller instead of using &error_abort.

Changes since v3:

General:
- Added David's, Greg's and Cornelia's Reviewed-by and Acked-by to some
  of the patches.
- Rebased on top of dgibson/ppc-for-5.2.

Patch "ppc/e500: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
Patch "mips/cps: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
Patch "sparc/sun4m: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Initialize CPU object with object_new() and qdev_realize() instead
  of cpu_create().
- Removed Reviewed-by's and Acked-by's from these patches because of
  these changes.

Changes since v2:

General:
- Added Philippe's Reviewed-by to some of the patches.

Patch "ppc/spapr: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Set the CPUState::start_powered_off variable directly rather than using
  object_property_set_bool(). Suggested by Philippe.

Patch "sparc/sun4m: Remove main_cpu_reset()"
- New patch. Suggested by Philippe.

Patch "sparc/sun4m: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Remove secondary_cpu_reset(). Suggested by Philippe.
- Remove setting of `cs->halted = 1` from cpu_devinit(). Suggested by Philippe.

Patch "Don't set CPUState::halted in cpu_devinit()"
- Squashed into previous patch. Suggested by Philippe.

Patch "sparc/sun4m: Use one cpu_reset() function for main and secondary CPUs"
- Dropped.

Patch "target/s390x: Use start-powered-off CPUState property"
- Set the CPUState::start_powered_off variable directly rather than using
  object_property_set_bool(). Suggested by Philippe.
- Mention in the commit message Eduardo's observation that before this
  patch, the code didn't set cs->halted on reset.
