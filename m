Yes, that's a good idea.  It needs to be the full x86_64-remote-softmmu
because hw/ code depends on the QEMU target :(.

To summarize the big advantage of this approach (besides reducing the
patch series): the existing makefile rules for softmmu will be used to
build the remote device program.  No new main() and no new per-object
file makefile rules are needed.
