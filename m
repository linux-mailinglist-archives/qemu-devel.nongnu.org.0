This was a poor attempt of my part to cut PAPR some slack.

TBH, even if current PAPR allows for some form of NUMA asymmetry, I don't think
it's worth implementing at all. It'll be more complexity on top of what I
already added here, and the best case scenario will be the kernel ignoring it
(worst case - kernel blowing it up because we're adding more associativity
arrays in each CPU and so on).



Thanks,
