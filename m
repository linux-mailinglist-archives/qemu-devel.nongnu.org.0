tbf, I struggle to explain/visualise that stuff with the "windows" etc
well. I wrote myself a program to visualise it for a good reason!
Well it was done in Rust, so there were two good reasons ;)

Yah, I said that because I didn't want them to have to mess with DT.
Later kernels do work, but need DT modifications as things are now
configured for the below case.

This one doesn't work in QEMU, so for those kernels I just delete the
ddrc_cache_hi node, and v6.2-rcN works in that way.

Ehh, any old initramfs for RISC-V should work, right? I suppose passing
a normal rootfs does either - I just mostly work w/ hardware & use NFS
there, so have nothing scripted to build a rootfs for me, which is why
I've been using initramfs.
I build one using buildroot, with a config like:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConchuOD/riscv-env/dev/conf/lowmem/buildr=
oot_initramfs_config

I then do (ripped from my makefile rule):
		$(linux_srcdir)/usr/gen_initramfs.sh \
		-o initramfs.cpio -u $(shell id -u) -g $(shell id -g) \
		initramfs.txt \
		$(path_to_buildroot_sysroot)

I'm lazy and CBA finding somewhere else to host this, so I put one here:
https://github.com/ConchuOD/riscv-env/releases/download/v2022.03/initramfs.=
cpio.gz

Thanks,
Conor.
