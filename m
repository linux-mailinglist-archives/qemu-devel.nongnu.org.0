This was my understanding as well. Thanks for the confirmation.

I like the idea of a balanced API; keeping the 'set' abort pending
until the next 'get', but this event doesn't work that way.
Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst states:

  It is not possible to read back a pending external abort (injected via
  KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS or otherwise) because such an exception is always
  delivered directly to the virtual CPU).

I think clearing the userspace copy instantly after a successful
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS implements that correctly.

Thanks,
