So it's certainly nice for security but not really a requirement for a
type-1 HV, right?

Does not even have to be numbers. We need a way to be woken up, a way to
stop/start listening for wakeups and a way to detect that there was a
wakeup while we were not listening.

Though there are special tricks for offloads where we poke through
layers in order to map things directly to hardware.
