ping...

Hello maintainers,
Is this series mature enough to be accepted?
Now each one patch in this version has been Reviewd/Acked.

Considering that I have another patchset on list that depends on this 
series,
and AFAIK there is another s390 patch series caring about the SMP changes
too, so I would appreciate your feedback. If there is still something to 
fix I
can do the work in time. Sorry for bothering. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks,
Yanan
