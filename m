What clarification are you after? The comment says we won't
enable MTTCG if the host has a weaker memory model than
the guest; arm64 has a weaker memory model than x86,
and so we don't enable MTTCG for x86 guest on arm64 host.
The 'it may be possible' paragraph explains why MTTCG
on this combination would be tricky.

(Strictly the comment should say "host must have at least as
strong a memory order as the guest", but that makes no difference
in the case you're asking about.)
