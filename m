That depends a lot on your use case.

If you have a long-lived production VM that you always run with the same
configuration, then yes, having a config file for it in the file system
is what you probably want. Currently, for this case, people directly
using QEMU tend to write a script that contains the command line. I
think I do have such scripts somewhere, but their number is very small.

My common case is short-lived VMs with configurations that change very
often between QEMU invocations. Here the command line is decidedly
superior.

Requiring me to create a file in the file system each time and to
remember deleting it after I'm done feels about as convenient as a *nix
shell that doesn't accept parameters for commands on the command line,
but instead requires you to write a one-off script first and then run
that.
