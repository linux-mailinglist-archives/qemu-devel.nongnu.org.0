A month is fairly tight for adding a new feature to the core code given
you would need to get up to speed with an area before proposing some
sort of change.

That said review time is also a contribution to open source and there
are plenty of patches on the list looking for someone to try them out
and poke around. Have a look through the list and see if anything jumps
out as interesting to you and review that.

If you want an area that is fairly self-contained you could consider
experimenting with the TCG plugins interface and try to measure
something useful about the behaviour of a virtual machine. See:

  https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/TCGPlugins

and the example plugins in tests/plugins - which you will see are all
self-contained experiments.
