I think your theory that it's over some period of time conflicts with
the documentation that says "at a specific point".

This would sidestep all of the artificial permission twiddling, which
sounds good.

It would probably also needlessly restrict the allowed use cases, but
then, who cares about nodes with multiple parents, one of which is a
quorum node?

So I guess I would be fine with either checking that there are no
parents or maybe even just dropping the check completely.
