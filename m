Before enabling virtio-iommu device, should we still let the devices
to access the whole system address space?  I believe that's at least
what Intel IOMMUs are doing.  From code-wise, its:

    if (likely(s->dmar_enabled)) {
        success =3D vtd_do_iommu_translate(vtd_as, vtd_as->bus, vtd_as->dev=
fn,
                                         addr, flag & IOMMU_WO, &iotlb);
    } else {
        /* DMAR disabled, passthrough, use 4k-page*/
        iotlb.iova =3D addr & VTD_PAGE_MASK_4K;
        iotlb.translated_addr =3D addr & VTD_PAGE_MASK_4K;
        iotlb.addr_mask =3D ~VTD_PAGE_MASK_4K;
        iotlb.perm =3D IOMMU_RW;
        success =3D true;
    }

From hardware-wise, an IOMMU should be close to transparent if you
never enable it, imho.

Otherwise I'm confused on how a guest (with virtio-iommu) could boot
with a normal BIOS that does not contain a virtio-iommu driver.  For
example, what if the BIOS needs to read some block sectors (as you
mentioned)?

Sorry, I meant when the system boots before the OS.

My understanding is that virtio devices are special in that they can
use the VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM flag to bypass any vIOMMU (though, I
don't think that'll work when virtio hardwares comes to the
world.. because they can't really bypass the IOMMU hardware).

Yes I agree.  However again when the BYPASS flag was introduced, have
you thought of introducing that flag per-device?  IMHO that could be
better because you have a finer granularity on controlling all these,
so you'll be able to reject malicious devices but at the meantime
grant permission to trusted devices.
