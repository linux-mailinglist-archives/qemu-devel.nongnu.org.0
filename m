Thanks for the insights.  I agree that there are tradeoffs, and I bet
that I'm speculating a lot, and there's just to much to be learned here.

My main point in proposing this very crude rule, though, is trying to
address the operational difficulties when such a Gating CI grows
beyond a single *machine* and *job* maintainer.  A practical example
may help.  Let's consider the following jobs are initially (on phase
1) active and *gating*:

 * test-qtest-ubuntu19.04-x86_64
 * test-qtest-ubuntu19.04-aarch64
 * test-qtest-ubuntu19.04-s390x

Then, because the model has proven successful, a new job that has
already being running for a while with successful results, but with no
influence to gating, is added to the gating group.  This job is being
run on a machine that is managed by a different maintainer:

 * test-qtest-centos8.0-ppc64le

After some time, the test-qtest-centos8.0-ppc64le job starts to fail,
with seemingly no relation to recently merged code.  From a CI
management perspective, disabling the job completely is reasonable if:

 * the machine seems to be faulty
 * ppc64le machine maintainer is unresponsive
 * there's no mechanism to disable a portion of the job (such as an
   specific test)
 * bug has been found but there's no short-term fix

This doesn't mean that a lot of test will be eliminated for good.
Unless the machine is faulty, it's expected that the tests will
continue to run, but not with Gating powers.  Also, it's expected that
the same (or similar) tests will be running on other machines/jobs.

IMO, it can be actually the opposite, when "skip test y on platform x"
conditions hidden in test code can survive a lot longer than a
disabled job/machine with a frustrated (and engaged) maintainer trying
to get it back to a "green" status, and then to a reliable status for
a given time so that it can be considered a gating job again.

Right.  So I believe we are in sync with the nature of the problem,
that is, that some tests would benefit from individually being pulled
from specific jobs until a permanent solution can be applied to them.

At the same time, if we can't do that (see the conditions that may
render us unable to do it), it would be fair to remove a CI job from
being gating.

Agreed.  Running tests in parallel while keeping/presenting traceable
results is a real problem, specially in a remote environment such as
in a CI.

FIY, slightly off-topic and Avocado specific: Avocado keeps each test
result in a separate directory and log file, which helps with that.
I'm bridging the parallel test runner (introduced a few releases back)
to the existing result/reporting infrastructure.  My goal is to have
that running the acceptance tests shortly.

At this point, I don't know how hard it'd be.  I'll certainly give it
a try.  Thomas has provided some extra info on another response to
this thread too.

OK, makes sense.  It'd be nice to know if other share the same general
idea.  I'll check how pervasive this general definition is on the
documentation too.

These will have to go into the existing ".gitlab-ci.yml" file, because
current GitLab has no support for multiple pipelines, and no support
for multiple "gitlab.yml" files.  That's one of the reasons why I took
the time to describe the proposal, because normalizing the current
file to receive extra jobs is, if not necessary, highly desirable.

Thanks for the feedback and insights,
