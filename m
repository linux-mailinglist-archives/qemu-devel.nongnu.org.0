Crashing would be bad.

Why don't we *just* do this?
OK, we wont fix the qom-set or the CLI, but if we just get hmp_qom_get
to call QMP, format it into json and then dump the json to the user,
then we get a usable, if not pretty, qom-get command, without having to
solve all these hard problems to move it forward?
