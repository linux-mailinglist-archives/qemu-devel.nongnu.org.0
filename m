It looks like the test case isn't properly exercising the code that is
likely to be wrong. It sounds like we need a proper comprehensive
testcase for fused operations (along the line of the ARM fcvt test
case). This can probably be a multiarch testcase which we can build for
all the various targets.

Title:
  ppc: softfloat float implementation issues

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Per bug #1841491, Richard Henderson (rth) said:
  > The float test failure is part of a larger problem for target/powerpc
  > in which all float routines are implemented incorrectly. They are all
  > implemented as double operations with rounding to float as a second
  > step. Which not only produces incorrect exceptions, as in this case,
  > but incorrect numerical results from the double rounding.
  >
  > This should probably be split to a separate bug...
