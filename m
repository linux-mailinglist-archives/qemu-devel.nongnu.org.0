In fact, iotest 197 (see commit 461743390) is an instance of testing for 
a bug where we overflowed INT_MAX due to rounding up to cluster size, 
even with a transaction request smaller than limits.

The only cases where int64_t + int can overflow due to rounding up for 
alignment are when the file size is extremely close to 2^63 bytes 
already.  The easiest fix is to reject opening a file that reports a 
size that would overflow when rounded up to alignment (that is, if size 
 > INT64_MAX - alignment, we should refuse to proceed).  Such images 
will never occur for actual disk images (because that is really a LOT of 
storage), but are possible over things like NBD (in fact, nbdkit has 
intentionally made it easy to provoke boundary testing near 2^63 bytes, 
and is already aware that anything larger than 2^63-512 is problematic 
in qemu).
