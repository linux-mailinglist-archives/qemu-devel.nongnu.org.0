Because the user configuring qemu (libvirt) is not the same user
accessing qemu NBD
server (ovirt, or some backup application).

ng?

We export HTTP API, allowing getting dirty extents and reading data:
https://www.ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/storage/increment=
al-backup.html#map-request
(this document is outdated, but it gives the general idea)

Or provide the NBD URL directly to user (future).

This is another option, I did not try to use this yet. We can use the singl=
e
exported bitmap and fail if we get more than one. This is probably better
than changing the entire stack to support bitmap name.

But we don't use qemu directly. We use libvirt, and libvirt does not expose
the name of the bitmap, or let use control this name.

This is a simplified flow:
1. libvirt starts a backup, creating the "backup-exportname" bitmap
2. oVirt host agent reports the nbd url for the disk
3. oVirt manager configures nbd/http proxy with nbd url
4. User (e.g. backup application) access the http/nbd proxy to get the
dirty extents

Alternatively, oVirt mangaer would provide the NBD url directly to the user=
,
and it will access it directly with some NBD client.

To make this work we need to pass more information between the
different programs
and change APIs to publish or accept bitmap names. This is a lot of
work that does
not help the current use case, accessing a single dirty bitmap.

We can solve it in libvirt if we don't have another choice.

That's a good point, we should not break existing usage.
