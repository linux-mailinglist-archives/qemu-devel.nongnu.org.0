No you don't need my understanding, as long as the maintainer likes it
it's good enough, so you probably only need to persuade the
maintainers. :)

But again for me I would prefer patch like this to simply be the first
patch of your live migration series.  There can be some exceptions
like that when the prerequisite is too big so we'd better split them
out to do things step by step, but this patch (which is a oneliner)
should not be the case.
