Matches my recollection (we had several ideas about how to tackle it; 
meta-bitmaps was proposed as one idea and this code landed, but we never 
actually finished that idea before a better one was actually coded, so 
this has always been dead code).

English is funny; "series" is one of the few words that works as both 
singular and plural (another example is "sheep").

My spin: "The original series was too optimistic."
