Hello,

resurrecting this, and in reference to its commit: "c03f041f128301c6a6c32242846be08719cd4fc3",

the name "internal.h" ends up polluting the include paths,
so that when working for example on s390x, including "internal.h" ends up including this instead of the file in target/s390x/.

I am not sure what exactly the right solution is, for this specific problem,
and if we should look at the include paths settings in detail,

but in my view calling files just "internal.h" or "internals.h" in general is not a good idea.

I can see two issues with this naming:

1) it describes nothing about the actual intended contents, other that they should be "internal".
Rather it would be better to know what the file is intended to contain, or we end up (as we end up) with very large files containing completely unrelated content.

2) we end up with clashes in our include paths if we are not super careful.

Probably in this case, the target/s390x/internal.h could be given another name (s390x-internal.h) and then split up in the future (there is a whole bunch of unrelated suff).

For accel/tcg/internal.h, maybe renaming it, or removing it altogether could both be good options?

Thanks,

Claudio
