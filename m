It seems correct that a backing file limits the virtual disk size of its
backing chain.

The "qemu-img commit" behavior seems counter-intuitive at first, but the
problem there is that the top-most image file is larger than its backing
file - not that the backing chain has differing sizes.  Committing
should not lose data, mid.qcow2 will be grown and then you get the
result you've observed.

I consider this a little weird but not a bug.  Does anyone else have
opinions?

Stefan
