A GIT source tree checkout of QEMU is approx 1 GB in size right now.
A build with just one target enable takes another 1 GB.
So if creating files in the source tree, or a build tree then, I'd
suggest a rule of thumb is to stay below that level as a rough
order of magnitude.

If creating in /tmp then stay below 100 MB, as it can be surprisingly
space constrained in some cases.

Daniel
