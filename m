But, Peter Krempa,

I see libvirt-dev listed as a recipient for a patch (from this series)
that changes an e-mail of a colleague of mine. Why would be
libvirt-dev be interested in that? Is libvirt really so sensitive to
the degree that to be afraid that changing an e-mail of a QEMU
contributor would impact libvirt design and/or its interface towards
QEMU? If you wishes that to remain so, I am of course fine with it,
who am I to determine that, but it looks like a severe overkill to me.

Best Regards,
Aleksandar
