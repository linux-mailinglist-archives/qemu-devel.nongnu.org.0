Hmm, I think you're taking a different approach to this than I was
thinking.  Re-reading my previous comments, the fact that both vfio.c
and vfio_iommu_type1.c each have their own private struct vfio_group
makes things rather unclear.  I was intending to use the struct
iommu_group as the object vfio.c provides to type1.c to associate the
pinning.  This would require that not only the vfio view of devices in
the group to be singleton, but also the actual iommu group to be
singleton.  Otherwise the set of devices vfio.c has in the group might
only be a subset of the group.  Maybe a merger of the approaches is
easier though.

Tracking whether the vfio.c view of a group is singleton is even easier
than above, we could simply add a device_count field to vfio_group,
increment it in vfio_group_create_device() and decrement it in
vfio_device_release().  vfio_pin_pages() could return error if
device_count is not 1.  We could still add the iommu_group pointer to
the type1 pin_pages callback, but perhaps type1 simply assumes that the
group is singleton when pin pages is called and it's vfio.c's
responsibility to maintain that group as singleton once pages have been
pinned.  vfio.c would therefore also need to set a field on the
vfio_group if pages have been pinned such that vfio_add_group_dev()
could return error if a new device attempts to join the group.  We'd
need to make sure that field is cleared when the group is released from
use and pay attention to races that might occur between adding devices
to a group and pinning pages.

This was relative to maintaining that the iommu group itself is
singleton, not just the vfio view of the group.  If we use the latter
as our basis, then you're right, we should need this, but vfio.c would
need to enforce that the group remains singleton if it has pinned
pages.  Does that make sense?  Thanks,

Alex
