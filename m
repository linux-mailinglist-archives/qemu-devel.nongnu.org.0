Of course.  What about something like this:

    In theory, a device becomes real only on realize.  In practice, the
    transition from unreal to real is a fuzzy one.  The work to make a
    device real can be spread between realize methods (fine),
    instance_init methods (wrong), and board code wiring up the device
    (fine as long as it effectively happens on realize).  Depending on
    what exactly is done where, a device can work even when we neglect
    to realize it.  Nevertheless, it's a clear misuse of the interface.
    Even when it works today (more or less by chance), it can break
    tomorrow.

The error handling will be unreachable.

The proper way to say "error not possible" is of course &error_abort,
not qdev_init_nofail()'s &error_fatal.

Many realize methods misuse the Error interface this way.  NULL instead
of &error_abort is also common.  Cleaning this up is yet another big
task.  But that's no excuse for making it bigger now.

Laurent, would you prefer unreachable error handling or &error_abort?

Pity.
