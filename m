shall we also deprecate short forms for -cpu model,[feat|+feat|-feat]
and in the end allow only -device compatible form i.e. -cpu type,feat=3D[on=
|off]

that would let us drop custom
  x86_cpu_parse_featurestr,
  ppc_cpu_parse_featurestr,
  sparc_cpu_parse_features

and a bunch of cpu_class_by_name, where almost each target does its
magic conversion of cpu_model to the type (which ranges from various
prefix/suffix shuffling to completely ignoring cpu_model and returning
a fixed cpu type)
