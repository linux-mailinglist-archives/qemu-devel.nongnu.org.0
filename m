Title:
  TCG memory leak with FreeDOS 'edit'

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  qemu trunk as of today leaks memory FAST when freedos' edit is
  running.

  To reproduce, download:

  https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-
  stuff/freedos/files/repositories/1.3/cdrom.iso

  Then run:

  $ qemu-system-i386 -cdrom cdrom.iso

  select your language then select "return to DOS", then type

  > edit

  it will consume memory at ~10MB/s

  This does NOT happen when adding -enable-kvm
