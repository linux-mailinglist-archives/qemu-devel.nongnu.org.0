Yeah, that would resolve this issue more appropriately for 9p2000.L, since 
Treaddir specifies an offset, but for 9p2000.u the result of a concurrent read 
on a directory (9p2000.u) would still be undefined.

No, they are not leaking actually.

You are right that they are not deallocated in do_readdir_many(), but that's 
intentional: in the new implementation of v9fs_do_readdir() you see that 
v9fs_free_dirents(entries) is *always* called at the very end of the function, 
no matter if success or any error. That's one of the measures to simplify 
overall code as much as possible.

As you might have noticed, the previous/current v9fs_do_readdir() 
implementation had quite a bunch of individual error pathes, which is quite 
error prone or at least makes it difficult to maintain. So I think it makes 
sense to strip unnecessary branches as much as possible.

Yes, you could move it forward, but what would you buy from that?

I think you mean the case when there's an error inside the if (dostat) {} 
block: The comments on struct V9fsDirEnt already suggest that the "st" member 
is optional and may be NULL. So if there's an error inside if (dostat) {}
then caller still has a valid "dent" field at least and it's up to caller 
whether or not it's a problem for its purpose that "st" is empty. For that 
reason I would not move the block forward.
