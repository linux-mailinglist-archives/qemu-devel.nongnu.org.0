Current COLO (with Lukas's patch) can support dynamic set COLO system.

This status is same like the secondary has triggered failover, the 
primary node need to find new secondary

node to combine new COLO system.

I think you need to check the port 9004 if already connect to the pair node.

Yes, you are right.

For this status, we don't need to sync the state of tcp connections, 
because after failover

(or just solo COLO primary node), we have empty all the tcp connections 
state in COLO module.

In the processing of build new COLO pair, we will sync all the VM state 
to secondary node and re-build

new track things in COLO module.

Yes, In previous COLO use cases, we need make primary node and secondary 
node boot in the same time.

I did't expect such a big difference on netfilter/chardev.

I think you can try without netfilter/chardev, after VM boot, re-build 
the netfilter/chardev related work with chardev server nowait.
