These are alot of scenarios / use cases not described in the
cover letter for this series.

I'm reviewing this series from the POV of the need to transfer
vmstate from a helper back to QEMU, which was the scenario in
the cover letter. From this I see no need for a bus.

If you think there's a more general use cases involving QEMU
backends that will need the bus, then I think the bigger picture
needs to be described when proposing the use of the bus, instead
of only describing the very simple vmstate use case as the
motivation.

Daniel
