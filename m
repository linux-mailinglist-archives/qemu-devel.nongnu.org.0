Well, nothing really. Since this is my first attempt ever, I hoped someone pointed
out some of mistakes which I did ;) It's definitely not that I need a personal ACK
for every change I picked up, that'd be silly.


I was AFK for a few days here, but before the trip I picked up another bunch,
mentioned by Thomas in his reply. The trip was somewhat unexpected, - I wanted
to send another "Patch round-up" email with the newly picked up stuff, but
haven't done so due to the trip.

Now looking at this I think it's better to roll the changes back to commit
688714bf7eca805f98e9601b686e48a2269fc169 (
https://gitlab.com/mjt0k/qemu/-/commits/stable-7.2-staging ), and release
7.2.1 tomorrow without those changes.

Thanks,

/mjt
