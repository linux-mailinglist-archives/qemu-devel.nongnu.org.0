> The class_init() function is straight forward (it is similar to the =
constructor in C++ OOP

The C++ constructor initialises class **instances**, i.e. C++ objects, =
not C++ classes.

In QEMU, the OOP functionality is implemented with nested structures =
used to store class and instance definitions, and callbacks as virtual =
methods.


The .class_init callbacks are called early, by a mechanism similar to =
C++ static constructors, and they initialise the structures used to =
store the class definitions. They are recursively chained, i.e. first =
the parent callback is called to initialise the parent structure =
members, then the current callback is called, to fill in its own =
members.

The .instance_init callback are automatically called when new =
**instances** of a class are created. Similarly, they are also =
recursively chained.

.instance_init may also create children objects, recursively.


.realize is a bit trickier. If .instance_init is the very first thing =
automatically called when creating an object, .realize is the very last =
thing, it is called manually when the whole hierarchy of objects is =
created and it signals that everything is ready, a kind of 'rien ne va =
plus'.

.realize usually has to manually call the parent .realize.

---

For me it was difficult to draw a line of what initialisations should be =
done in .instance_init and what in .realize, but given that .realise is =
called when the whole hierarchy is ready, it might do links between =
objects, which are not available when .instance_init is called.

A simple rule would be for .instance_init to ensure that all members =
have default values and properties associated with them, and defer all =
functional initialisations to .realize.


Hope this helps,

Liviu
