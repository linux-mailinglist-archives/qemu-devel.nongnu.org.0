Here is the output. I assumed you meant qemu-system-ppc.

$ ./ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc -audio-help
Environment variable based configuration deprecated.
Please use the new -audiodev option.

Equivalent -audiodev to your current environment variables:
(Since you didn't specify QEMU_AUDIO_DRV, I'll list all possibilities)
-audiodev id=3Doss,driver=3Doss
-audiodev id=3Dnone,driver=3Dnone

Title:
  pulseaudio Invalid argument error

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When using qemu-system-ppc on Ubuntu Mate 15 with the usb audio card,
  I see these error messages:

  pulseaudio: set_sink_input_volume() failed
  pulseaudio: Reason: Invalid argument
  pulseaudio: set_sink_input_mute() failed
  pulseaudio: Reason: Invalid argument

  No audio plays. When an attempt is made, QEMU seems to freeze for a
  moment.

  I use "-device usb-audio" to add the usb sound card. This issue is
  present in both emulation and KVM mode.
