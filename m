Code doesn't neccessarily want to deal with the per-event type
structs. It is credible to want to work with the abstract 'Event'
interface in places and being able to get the Timestamp from that,
without figuring out what specific event struct to cast it to first.

I think this specific case is out of scope for the "standard" JSON
APIs, and somewhere you'd expect APIs to do their own thing a layer
above, which is what we're doing here.

More importantly though what we're generating in terms of QAPI derived
APIs should be thought of as only the first step. Ultimately I would
not expect clients to be marshalling / unmarshalling these structs at
all. So from that POV I think the question of "non-standard" APIs is
largely irrelevant. 

Instead we would be providing a "QMPClient" type with APIs for sending/
receiving instances of the 'Command'/'Response' interfaces, along with
callback(s) that receives instances of the 'Event' interface.  Any JSON
marshalling is hidden behind the scenes as an internal imlp detail.

With regards,
Daniel
