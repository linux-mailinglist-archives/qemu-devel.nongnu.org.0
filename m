I don't think that's a good idea - in that case, you have to make sure
to include hw/hw.h everywhere again, so you don't gain that much
compared to including config-devices.h directly everywhere. osdep.h is
our header that has to be included everywhere, so if we want to make
sure that these defines are available everywhere, we have to include it
from osdep.h.
Apart from that, hw/hw.h just contains one more prototype - which likely
should be renamed to cpu_hw_error() and moved to a cpu header instead,
so that we can finally delete hw/hw.h completely.
