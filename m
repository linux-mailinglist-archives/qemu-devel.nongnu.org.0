Yeah and each compiler has its take as how to handle that.

FWIW see section 3.1 of this bachelor thesis on the topic:

https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelors-theses/2017/Matthias_Vogelaar___4372913___Defining_the_Undefined_in_C.pdf

The contract of object_property_get_enum() which is the next function
in object.h explicitly says that the result is undefined, even if
the implementation returns 0. So I was thinking of doing the same
for object_property_get_uint().

I had such an assertion in mind but if you think this restriction is
abusive, I take your word :)

That's what I had in mind.

$ git grep object_property_get_uint -- :^{include,qom/object.c} | wc -l
60

Manual inspecting the output of

$ git grep -W object_property_get_uint -- :^{include,qom/object.c}
...

seems to be showing that most users simply ignore errors (ie. pass NULL
as 3rd argument). Then some users pass &error_abort and only a few
pass a &err or errp.

Assuming that users know what they're doing, I guess my proposal
wouldn't bring much to the code base in the end... I'm not even
sure now that it's worth changing the contract.

Cheers,
