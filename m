Provided tunables are strictl just tunables, that would be viable.
Right now our tunables are a mixture of tunables and low level
data transport architectural knobs.

I'm just refering to the postcopy capability that we nneed to
set upfront before starting the migration on both sides.  IIUC
that should be possible for QEMU to automatically figure out,
if it could negotiate with dst QEMU.

Whether we ever switch from precopy to postcopy mode once
running can remain under mgmt app control.

I'm pretty sure kTLS will always be a benefit, because even without
hardware offload you still benefit from getting the TLS encryption
onto a separate CPU core from QEMU's migration thread. We've measured
this already with NBD and I've no reason to suspect it will differ
for migration.

For RDMA there are two options

 - Drop RDMA support (preferred ;-)

 - Use a regular TCP channel for the migration protocol
   handshake todo all the feature negotiation.  Open a
   second channel using RDMA just for the migration payload

Before considering "exec", lets think about "fd" as that's more
critical.

How can be get an arbitrary number of bi-directional channels
open when the user is passing in pre-opened FDs individual and
does not know upfront how many QEMU wants ?

We could have an event that QEMU emits whenever it wants to be
given a new "fd" channel. The mgmt app would watch for that and
pass in more pre-opened FDs in response. Not too difficult

Back to "exec" we have two options

 - Drop exec support, and just let the user spawn the
   program externally and pass in a pre-opened socket
   FDs for talking to it

 - Keep exec and make it use a socketpair instead of
   pipe FDs. Connect the socketpair to both stdin+stdout.
   Exec the program many times if needing many channels.

Daniel
