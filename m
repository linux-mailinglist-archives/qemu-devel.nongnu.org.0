Not quite so easy as you might think :-). The problem is that, in our=20
fervor to make Q35 guests "as similar as possible" to 440fx guests, we=20
have made the PCI address assignment code search out a hotplug-capable=20
slot for each unassigned device, and if no hotpluggable slot is=20
available it automatically adds a new root port so that there is a=20
hotplug-capable slot. With the current set of VIR_PCI_CONNECT_TYPE=20
flags, unless we lie to that code and tell it that these new root ports=20
support hotplug, the the devices will be assigned first to the two=20
available hotpluggable root ports (in your example above), and then when=20
those are both used, it will start adding new root ports - the ports=20
with hotplug=3D'no' will never be used.

On the other hand, if we change the code to *not* require a=20
hotplug-capable port, then the new devices will just be assigned to=20
slots on the root bus.

So the address assignment code is going to need to be re-jiggered. I=20
guess we would need to create yet another PCI controller capability for=20
use by the address assignment code - "Not=20
Hot-Pluggable-But-Still-Okay-For-Auto-Assign-When-The-Guest-Is-Powered-Off"=
.

So, a mental exercise - let's say we make a new virDomainPCIConnectFlag=20
called VIR_PCI_CONNECT_AUTO_ASSIGNABLE (that's a bit easier to say than=20
what I had in the previous paragraph). That connect type would be added=20
to all the controllers that currently have CONNECT_HOTPLUGGABLE set:

     pci-root
     pci-bridge
     pcie-root
     pcie-pci-bridge
     pcie-root-port
     pcie-downstream-port

We then add a new controller model=20
VIR_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_PCIE_ROOT_PORT_NO_HOTPLUG and set it as=20
AUTO_ASSIGNABLE, but *not* HOTPLUGGABLE.

Now when a device is added to "cold" config, instead of requiring=20
HOTPLUGGABLE, we require AUTO_ASSIGNABLE, which will get the same=20
assignment as before the change (except that the NO_HOTPLUG root ports=20
will also be used). If we actually hotplug a device, then we continue to=20
require the HOTPLUGGABLE connect flag.

So that much works, but we still have the problem that in order to add a=20
device to the "cold" config that can later be hotplugged, we have to=20
make sure all of the hotplug=3D'no' controllers are in use.

I guess that will work, but it's getting pretty obtuse and complicated=20
just to avoid adding a single flag that says "this device shouldn't be=20
put in a hotplug-capable slot" directly to the XML for the device that=20
you don't want hotplugged. It would be *much* simpler if qemu could=20
provide an attribute for endpoint devices that would disable hotplug for=20
that device, rather than requiring the option to be set on the=20
controller that the device is plugged into. Then libvirt could just have=20
that attribute added to the XML, and the management app would just=20
simply add "hotplug=3D'no'" to each device. It's too bad that the method=20
vfio-pci-nohotplug uses apparently doesn't work for PCIe...
