Switch on the next machine type version - it doesn't matter if migration
is incompatible then.

Without knowing anything about the innards of DRCs, I suggest a=20
DRCMulti that takes a parameter and represents 'n' DRCs at consecutive
chunks of memory.  Then use one DRCMulti for each RAMBlock or DIMM or
other convenient sized thing.
