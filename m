Nothing that should hold up your pull request, but I'd prefer to fix the
comment in a follow-up.

One thing where I could imagine it becoming relevant in the future is
cross-context block jobs. At the moment, we automatically pull the
target node into the AioContext of the source and fail if this isn't
possible, but that's really overly restrictive.
