Hi Qiuhao,
It was a primary goal to run the fuzzers on OSS-Fuzz, and at the time,
AFL++ was not an option on OSS-Fuzz. Because I didn't find any great
way to reset QEMU between inputs, we hacked-in a forkserver.
It still seems that OSS-Fuzz is primarily designed around libfuzzer, but
now that there seems to be AFL++ support, it would be nice to start
using AFL++ as well. I just haven't had the time to look into it ;)

I've seen the fuzz-bench results - It will be interesting to see the
performance for an enormous target like QEMU. There are also some things
that AFL++ doesn't do as well as libfuzzer - some: examples here: 
https://github.com/AFLplusplus/fuzzer-challenges/tree/main/libfuzzer
