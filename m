This function is actually quite subtle, and I think your change will
work, but it has changed the behaviour slightly.

When we enter the function the *current_data is pointing at actual guest
RAM and is changing as we're running.
It's critical that the contents of the cache match what was actually
sent, so that in the next cycle the correct delta is generated;
thus the reason for the two memcpy's is actually different.

In this case, we've not managed to compress, so we're going to have to
transmit the whole page; but remember the guest is still writing. So we
update the cache, and then update *current_data to point to the cache
so that the caller sends from the cache directly rather than the guest
RAM, this ensures that the thing that's sent matches the cache contents.

However, note the memcpy is from *current_data, not XBZRLE.current_buf,
so it might be slightly newer  - this is the first change you have made;
you might be sending data that's slightly older; but it's safe because
the data sent does match the cache contents.

This memcpy is slightly different.
Here we've managed to do the compress; so now we update the cache based
on what was compressed (current_buf).  *current_data isn't used by the
caller in this case because it's actually sending the compressed data.
So it's safe for you to update it.

So I think we need to add comments like that, how about:

       /*
        * Update the cache contents, so that it corresponds to the data
        * sent, in allc ases except where we skip the page.
        */

        * sends the data from the cache, since the guest might have
        * changed the RAM since we copied it.
        */
