This bug was fixed in the package qemu - 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.5

---------------
qemu (1:4.2-3ubuntu6.5) focal; urgency=3Dmedium

  * further stabilize qemu by importing patches of qemu v4.2.1
    Fixes (LP: #1891203) and (LP: #1891877)
    - d/p/stable/lp-1891877-*
    - as part of the stabilization this also fixes an
      riscv emulation issue due to the CVE-2020-13754 fixes via
      d/p/ubuntu/hw-riscv-Allow-64-bit-access-to-SiFive-CLINT.patch
  * fix s390x SQXBR emulation (LP: #1883984)
    - d/p/ubuntu/lp-1883984-target-s390x-Fix-SQXBR.patch
  * fix -no-reboot for s390x protvirt guests (LP: #1890154)

Title:
  QEMU S/390x sqxbr (128-bit IEEE 754 square root) crashes qemu-system-
  s390x

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  Fix Released
Status in qemu source package in Focal:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  [Impact]

   * An instruction was described wrong so that on usage the program would =

     crash.

  [Test Case]

   * Run s390x in emulation and there use this program:
     For simplicity and speed you can use KVM guest as usual on s390x, that =

     after prep&install&compile of the test you run in qemu-tcg like:

     $ sudo qemu-system-s390x -machine s390-ccw-virtio,accel=3Dtcg -cpu max=
,zpci=3Don -serial mon:stdio -display none -m 4096 -nic user,model=3Dvirtio=
,hostfwd=3Dtcp::2222-:22 -drive file=3D/var/lib/uvtool/libvirt/images/focal=
-sqxbr.qcow,if=3Dnone,id=3Ddrive-virtio-disk0,format=3Dqcow2,cache=3Dnone -=
device virtio-blk-ccw,devno=3Dfe.0.0001,drive=3Ddrive-virtio-disk0,id=3Dvir=
tio-disk0,bootindex=3D1,scsi=3Doff
     Obviously is you have no s390x access you need to use emulation right =

     away.

   * Build and run failing program
     $ sudo apt install clang
     $ cat > bug-sqrtl-one-line.c << EOF
  int main(void) { volatile long double x, r; x =3D 4.0L; __asm__ =

  __volatile__("sqxbr %0, %1" : "=3Df" (r) : "f" (x)); return (0);}
  EOF
     $ cc bug-sqrtl-one-line.c
     $ ./a.out
     Segmentation fault (core dumped)

     qemu is dead by now as long as the bug is present

  [Regression Potential]

   * The change only modifies 128 bit square root on s390x so regressions
     should be limited to exactly that - which formerly before this fix was =

     a broken instruction.

  [Other Info]
   =

   * n/a

  ---

  In porting software to guest Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 VMs for S/390x, I dis=
covered
  that some of my own numerical programs, and also a GNU configure script f=
or at
  least one package with CC=3Dclang, would cause an instant crash of the VM=
, sometimes
  also destroying recently opened files, and producing long strings of NUL =
characters
  in /var/log/syslog in the S/390 guest O/S.

  Further detective work narrowed the cause of the crash down to a single I=
BM S/390
  instruction: sqxbr (128-bit IEEE 754 square root).  Here is a one-line pr=
ogram
  that when compiled and run on a VM hosted on QEMUcc emulator version 4.2.0
  (Debian 1:4.2-3ubuntu6.1) [hosted on Ubuntu 20.04 on a Dell Precision 7920
  workstation with an Intel Xeon Platinum 8253 CPU],  and also on QEMU emul=
ator
  version 5.0.0, reproducibly produces a VM crash under qemu-system-s390x.

  % cat bug-sqrtl-one-line.c
  int main(void) { volatile long double x, r; x =3D 4.0L; __asm__ __volatil=
e__("sqxbr %0, %1" : "=3Df" (r) : "f" (x)); return (0);}

  % cc bug-sqrtl-one-line.c && ./a.out
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  The problem code may be the function float128_sqrt() defined in qemu-5.0.=
0/fpu/softfloat.c
  starting at line 7619.  I have NOT attempted to run the qemu-system-s390x=
 executable
  under a debugger.  However, I observe that S/390 is the only CPU family t=
hat I know of,
  except possibly for a Fujitsu SPARC-64, that has a 128-bit square root in=
 hardware.
  Thus, this instruction bug may not have been seen before.
