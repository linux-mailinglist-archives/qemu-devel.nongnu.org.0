Interleaving, or rather executing another command in the middle of its
implementation is the very purpose of human-monitor-command (which is
what I was talking about, so "the in-band non-coroutine QMP command" is
a very specific one).

It's the only command I can think of that is exceptional in this way
and would lead to three mappings.
