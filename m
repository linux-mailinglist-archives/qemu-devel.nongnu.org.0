Right, but it still doesn't make sense to use scm_block_size when you
create the dynamic-memory-v2 property.  As far as the thing
interpreting that goes, it *must* be LMB size, not SCM block size.  If
those are required to be the same at this point, you should use an
assert().

Ok, that fits very weirdly with the DRC allocation for the rest of
pluggable memory, but I suppose that's PAPR for you.

Having these in together is very inscrutable though, and relies on a
heap of non-obvious constraints about placement of DIMMs and NVDIMMs
relative to each other.  I really wonder if it would be better to have
a completely different address range for the NVDIMMs.

Hrm.  Ok so we already have code that does that for any gaps between
DIMMs.  I don't think there's actually anything that that code will do
differently than the code you have for NVDIMMs, so you could just skip
over the NVDIMMs here and it should do the right thing.

The *interpretation* of those entries will become different: for space
into which a regular DIMM is later inserted, we'll assume the DRC
index given is a base and there are more DRCs following it, but for
NVDIMMs we'll assume the same DRC throughout.  This is nuts, but IIUC
that's what PAPR says and we can't do much about it.

Ok.
