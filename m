I am happy to follow this rule on cpu-topo refactoring work, but 
sometimes calling qdev_get_machine() is inevitable.

The division of responsibility for this case (refactoring 
qemu_init_vcpu) seems to be a poisonous apple.

The prerequisite for setting cpu-> nr_cores / nr_threads from the parent 
is that the CPU has been created, so if any process during 
initialization needs this topo information, it will use the default 
values form cpu_common_initfn() instead of user-configured parameters.

We may not want to repeat those assignment operations using the new 
values and what do you think, Igor?
