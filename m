Since Linux kernel v5.2-rc1 KVM has support for enabling SVE in guests.
This series provides the QEMU bits for that enablement. This is a v2
series, however it looks completely different than v1. Thank you to
all who reviewed v1. I've included all input still relevant to this
new approach. And the new approach is thanks to Igor for suggesting
it. The new approach is to use a CPU property for each vector length
and then implement the preexisting qmp_query_cpu_model_expansion
query for Arm to expose them. Here's how the series goes:

First, we select existing CPU properties representing features we
want to advertise in addition to the SVE vector lengths and prepare
them for the qmp query. Then we introduce the qmp query, applying
it immediately to those selected features. We next add a qtest for
the selected CPU features that uses the qmp query for its tests - and
we continue to add tests as we add CPU features with the following
patches. So then, once we have the support we need for CPU feature
querying and testing, we add our first SVE CPU feature property, sve,
which just allows SVE to be completely enabled/disabled. Following
that feature property, we add all 16 vector length properties along
with the input validation they need and tests to prove the validation
works. At this point the SVE features are still only for TCG, so we
provide some patches to prepare for KVM and then a patch that allows
the 'max' CPU type to enable SVE with KVM, but at first without
vector length properties. After a bit more preparation we add the
SVE vector length properties to the KVM-enabled 'max' CPU type along
with the additional input validation and tests that that needs.
Finally we allow the 'host' CPU type to also enjoy these properties
by simply sharing them with it.

Phew, I think that's everything.

Thanks!
