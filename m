This inspection can detect more than 1GB of unallocated (64KB) clusters per
loop and it's a shallower path.

If I am not mistaken, the copy loop does one cluster per iteration using a
twice deeper call path (trying to copy and eventually finding unallocated
clusters).  So with 64KB cluster size, it's 2 * 1G/64K ~= 32 million times
less efficient with the CPU cycles for large sparse virtual disks.

I think the early stop of inefficiency can help minimize the CPU impact of
the backup job on the VM instance.

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Yes, I&#39;m hoping Vladimir (or his other buddies =
at Virtuozzo) can chime<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0in.=C2=A0 Meanwhile, I&#39;ve working on v2 of some=
 patches that will improve<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0qemu&#39;s ability to tell if a destination qcow2 f=
ile already reads as all<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0zeroes, and we already have bdrv_block_status() for=
 telling which<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0portions of a source image already read as all zero=
es (whether or<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0not it<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0is due to not being allocated, the goal here is tha=
t we should NOT have<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0to copy anything that reads as zero on the source o=
ver to the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0destination if the destination already starts life =
as reading all zero).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Can the eventual/optimal solution allow unallocated clusters to be<br>
&gt; skipped entirely in the backup loop and make the detection of allocate=
d<br>
&gt; zeroes an option,=C2=A0not forcing the backup thread to loop through a=
<br>
&gt; potentially=C2=A0huge empty virtual disk?<br>
&gt; <br>
<br>
I mean, using the TOP code is doing the same thing, really: it&#39;s lookin=
g<br>
at allocation status and marking those blocks as &quot;already copied&quot;=
, more<br>
or less.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0And if nothing else, qemu 5.0 just added &#39;qemu-=
img convert<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0--target-is-zero&#39; as a last-ditch means of tell=
ing qemu to assume the<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0destination reads as all zeroes, even if it cannot =
quickly prove it; we<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0probably want to add a similar knob into the QMP co=
mmands for<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0initiating<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0block backup, for the same reasons.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This seems a good way of assuring the=C2=A0status of the target file.<=
