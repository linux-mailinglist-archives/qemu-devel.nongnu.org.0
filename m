I'm afraid I've no idea how qtests work. If you are talking about a unit 
test for dp8393x.c, this would be non-trivial because you need to have the 
SONIC in bus master mode (i.e. you have to get the chip to do some DMA).

The chip datasheet says,

    Data Bus: These bidirectional lines are used to transfer data on the 
    system bus. When the SONIC is a bus master, 16-bit data is transferred 
    on D15-D0 and 32-bit data is transferred on D31-D0. When the SONIC is 
    accessed as a slave, register data is driven onto lines D15-D0. 
    D31-D16 are held TRI-STATE if SONIC is in 16-bit mode. If SONIC is in 
    32-bit mode, they are driven, but invalid.

The datasheet does not explicitly state that D31-D16 are held low during a 
DMA write, it just says they are "not used". But I'm beginning to think 
that forcing the MSW to zero (see above) is the right thing to do.

The bus slave situation relates to e.g. the Silicon Revision register 
access. This is what breaks the Linux jazzsonic driver.

In that situation, the datasheet says that D31-D16 are "driven, but 
invalid". I think the right fix for that is,

--- a/hw/net/dp8393x.c
+++ b/hw/net/dp8393x.c
@@ -695,8 +695,8 @@ static void dp8393x_write(void *opaque, hwaddr addr, 
uint64_t data,

 };

This change seems to fix Linux/mipsel and break Linux/m68k, even though 
both use the chip in 32-bit mode... I guess there's another endianness 
bug somewhere.
