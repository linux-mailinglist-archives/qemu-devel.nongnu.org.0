Sorry about that. I had to put some whitespace in the two lines I 
modified because of checkpatch.pl, but then the nearby lines would have 
had inconsistent style if left unmodified. On the other hand, QEMU wiki 
said it is ok to fix style issues in the immediate area.

That's right. The only real change is uint16_t -> uint32_t in GUSregd. 
This reverses what seems to be an accident in commit 135f5ae1974c, where 
GUSdword (defined as "unsigned int" or "uint32_t" depending on compiler) 
was replaced with uint16_t. That change broke applications that 
read/write DRAM above 64k via I/O ports (in lieu of using DMA.)

Yes (assuming compiler aligns struct fields properly.) It is not obvious 
though (and easy to break), so I suppose refactoring much of the GUS 
code would be nice. For example, the few places where GUSregd(position) 
is used, position is 2 (mod 4). On the other hand, gusptr is also 2 (mod 
4) bytes (making gusptr+position = 0 (mod 4)), because we have the struct

typedef struct GUSState {
     ISADevice dev;
     GUSEmuState emu;
     QEMUSoundCard card;
     uint32_t freq;
     uint32_t port;
     int pos, left, shift, irqs;
     int16_t *mixbuf;
     uint8_t himem[1024 * 1024 + 32 + 4096];
     int samples;
     SWVoiceOut *voice;
     int64_t last_ticks;
     qemu_irq pic;
     IsaDma *isa_dma;
     PortioList portio_list1;
     PortioList portio_list2;
} GUSState;

where himem is 2 (mod 4). When GUSregd() is used, gusptr is (himem + 
1024 * 1024 + 32), so gusptr is also 2 (mod 4). Similar applies to 
GUSvoice(position).

Best regards,
Allan
