Yes. I considered this means. But it needs host to initiate this action.
However, when a device needs reset is determined by the device driver
in VM. So in practice, VM still needs a way to notify host to do
unplug/reset/plug. As the standard FLR capability can meet the
requirement, I don't try to invent one.

Will do.
