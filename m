Right.  I failed to see that we can run into a bridge without a
"chassis_nr" here.

Before d2623129a7de, the error got *ignored* in
spapr_dr_connector_new():

    SpaprDrc *spapr_dr_connector_new(Object *owner, const char *type,
                                             uint32_t id)
    {
        SpaprDrc *drc = SPAPR_DR_CONNECTOR(object_new(type));
        char *prop_name;

        drc->id = id;
        drc->owner = owner;
        prop_name = g_strdup_printf("dr-connector[%"PRIu32"]",
                                    spapr_drc_index(drc));
        object_property_add_child(owner, prop_name, OBJECT(drc), &error_abort);
        object_unref(OBJECT(drc));
--->    object_property_set_bool(OBJECT(drc), true, "realized", NULL);
        g_free(prop_name);

        return drc;
    }

I doubt that's healthy.

I agree 7ef1553dac broke the "use a bridge that doesn't have property
'chassis_nr' case.

I suspect the "duplicate chassis_nr" case has always been broken, and
d2623129a7de merely uncovered it.

If we can trigger the abort with hot-plug, then d2623129a7de made things
materially worse (new way to accidentally kill your guest and maybe lose
data), and I'd add a Fixes: blaming it.
