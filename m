Title:
  QNX 4 doesn't boot on qemu >=3D 1.3

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  I am using virtual machine with QNX4 operating system installed on it.  I=
 updated my qemu from version
  to newer and QNX4 doesn't start any more. All is ok on version 1.2 but wh=
en I try to use any newer version
  (1.3, 1.4, 1.5)  QNX4 doesn't boot.  I tried on windows and linux ubuntu =
hosts - effects are the same.

  When virtual machine boots qnx bootloader loads and starts operating syst=
em. In the next step
  qnx starts its ide driver, which detects qemu harddisk and cdrom. Problem=
 starts when operating system
  tries mount partition - an error occur and qnx stop booting procedure:

  mount -p "No bios signature in partition sector on /dev/hd0"

  I have tried install qnx from cdrom but it seems that there is the same p=
roblem. QNX installer boot from
  cdrom, detects hard disk and cdrom, but cdrom can't be mounted in the nex=
t step of installation procedure.
