I hope that 52 was just a typo ... ?

I guess we could go through that list of jobs and remove the duplicated 
target CPUs, e.g. it should be enough to test x86_64-softmmu only once.

I recently had the very same idea already:

  https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/65aff82076a9bbfdf7

:-)

Care to send a patch? Or shall we just wait one more months and then remove 
these jobs (since we won't support RHEL7 after QEMU 6.0 anymore)?

But code that we have in the repository should get at least some basic test 
coverage, otherwise it bitrots soon ... so it's maybe rather the other old 
problem that we struggle with, that we should deprecate more code and remove 
it if nobody cares about it...

AFAIK we never really enabled ccache in the gitlab-CI, only in Travis.

I've found some nice instructions here:

https://gould.cx/ted/blog/2017/06/10/ccache-for-Gitlab-CI/

... and just kicked off a build with these modifications, let's see how it 
goes...

Right, I think we should also work more towards consolidating the QEMU 
binaries, to avoid that we have to always build sooo many target binaries 
again and again. E.g.:

- Do we still need to support 32-bit hosts? If not we could
   finally get rid of qemu-system-i386, qemu-system-ppc,
   qemu-system-arm, etc. and just provide the 64-bit variants

- Could we maybe somehow unify the targets that have both, big
   and little endian versions? Then we could merge e.g.
   qemu-system-microblaze and qemu-system-microblazeel etc.

- Or could we maybe even build a unified qemu-system binary that
   contains all target CPUs? ... that would also allow e.g.
   machines with a x86 main CPU and an ARM-based board management
   controller...

Since the build system has been converted to meson, I think the configure 
script prefers to use the submodules instead of the distro packages. I've 
tried to remedy this a little bit here:

https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/db0108d5d846e9a8

... but new jobs of course will use the submodules again if the author is 
not careful.

I think we should tweak that behavior again to use the system version of 
capstone, slirp and dtc instead if these are available. Paolo, what do you 
think?

Also I wonder whether we could maybe even get rid of the capstone and slirp 
submodules in QEMU now ... these libraries should be available in the most 
distros by now, and otherwise people could also install them manually instead?
