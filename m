I'm following bits of this discussion, some thoughts;
if your device doesn't support reconnect, then if, at the start of
migration you find that you can't start the log what is the correct
behaviour?  You can't carry on with the migration because you'd have an
inconsistent migration state; so I guess that's why the abort() is there
- but I think I'd generally prefer to fail the migration and hope the
vhsot device is still working for anything other than the log.

You're going to have to be pretty careful with the ordering of reconect
- reconnecting on the source during a migration sounds pretty hairy, but
a migration can take many minutes, so if you really want to survive this
I guess you have to.
