Urgh, no, we can't rely on that.

I completely forgot that we would need to know the size during
the deallocate function.  The portable way to deal with this
will be to change all our code that handles passwords to use
GString instead, since that is a struct carrying around the
allocated size.

As mentioned in v1, I'm fine if you just let this series use
memset as this is a pre-existing problem & we can fix it
in separate yseries.

Daniel
