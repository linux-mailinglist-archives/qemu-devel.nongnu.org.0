Initial support of multi-process qemu

Started with the presentation in October 2017 made by
Marc-Andre (Red Hat) and Konrad Wilk (Oracle)
(http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/KVM%20FORUM%20multi-process.pdf,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq1-coHh7lg) and
continued in the BoF session at the KVM forum in 2018 with Jag leading
the discussion, the multi-process project is now in the prototype version
and presented by this patchset.

The proof of the concept patches were posted on the qemu-devel mailing
list before the BoF session at the KVM forum and can be found here:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg566538.html

This series presents the initial support for QEMU that can
launch some of the devices in the remote processes.

Thanks to a v1 review and some of the question Stefan and Daniel asked, we
were able to incorporate your ideas into our goals.

We would like to present version 2 of the patchset.
This version has addressed comments made during the review of v1 and includes:

- support for libvirt fork/exec of remote processes;
  QEMU is still capable of fork/execing the remote processes unless its disabled
  by seccomp.
  When using libvirt, the daemon will spawn remote processes and pass the communication
  file descriptors to main QEMU process and the remote processes.
  The libvirt patches are in the making and will be sent out shortly;
- using existing -device/-drive command line options to specify remote devices with
  additional suboptons;
- refractor message sending code;
- remove specific HMP/QMP commands and use the one that exist now;
- extend existing QMP commands;
- added timeout to communication channel;

Following people contributed to this patchset:

John G Johnson <john.g.johnson@oracle.com>
Jagannathan Raman <jag.raman@oracle.com>
Elena Ufimtseva <elena.ufimtseva@oracle.com>
Kanth Ghatraju <kanth.ghatraju@oracle.com>

For full concept writeup about QEMU disaggregation refer to
docs/devel/qemu-multiprocess.txt.

This series has a limited scope and allows QEMU to launch
LSI SCSI controller emulation in the separate process and
execute HMP commands to manipulate the devices.
This series with appropriate libvirt patches allows to
launch a guest with remote processes using libvirt.
(libvirt patches will be posted and will be reflected in the reply to
this patch).

Please refer to the docs/qemu-multiprocess.txt for usage
information.

his series is based on qemu upstream commit
3284aa128153750f14a61e8a96fd085e6f2999b6.

TODO items:
  - bus support for remote process (non-default);
  - live migration;
  - performance improvements;
  - support for more devices;
  - support for seccomp for remote processes;
  - support for CPU disaggregated emulation;

We would like to welcome all your ideas, concerns and questions
for this patchset.

Thank you!
