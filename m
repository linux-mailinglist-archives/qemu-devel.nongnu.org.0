'heavily based' is a polite way to say that file is copied and then changed
to fit new purpose, isn't it :-)

Yes, I absolutely missed this part since I don't know the block layer well =
enough.
Thanks for explaining this on IRC, that blockdev_create job is special
in a sense that block device state doesn't exit yet for it (I also was alre=
ady bitten
by this in luks block driver), thus the job runs in main AIO context.
No need to do so in amend, and thus I'll remove that wrongly copy&pasta'ed =
comment.

Thanks a lot!!
