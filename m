[Copy/pasting my comment from here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1737625/comments/4]

I just talked to Dave Gilbert from upstream QEMU. Overall, as I implied
in comment#2, this gnarly issue requires specialized debugging, digging
deep into the bowels of QEMU, 'virtio-blk' and 'virtio.

That said, Dave notes that we get this "guest index inconsistent" error
when the migrated RAM is inconsistent with the migrated 'virtio' device
state. And a common case is where a 'virtio' device does an operation
after the vCPU is stopped and after RAM has been transmitted.

Dave makes some guesswork of a potential scenario where this can occur:

  - Guest is running
  - ... live migration starts
  - ... a "block read" request gets submitteed
  - ... live migration stops the vCPUs, finishes transmitting RAM
  - ... the "block read" completes, 'virtio-blk' updates pointers
  - ... live migration "serializes" the 'virito-blk' state

So the "guest index inconsistent" state would only happen if you got
unlucky with the timing of that read.

Another possibility, Dave points out, is that the guest has screwed up
the device state somehow; the migration code in 'virtio' checks the
state a lot. We have ruled this possibility out becausethe guest is just
a garden-variety CirrOS instance idling; nothing special about it.
