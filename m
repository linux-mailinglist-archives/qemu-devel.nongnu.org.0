Your choice.  If you choose to pretend PATCH 3 was in, have your commit
message point that out.

Correct.

Let me convince myself you're right.

Cases before this series:

(exec) execute, allow-oob does not matter

    Run in main loop bottom half monitor_qmp_bh_dispatcher(), outside
    coroutine context, scheduled by handle_qmp_command()

(err1) exec-oob, QMP_CAPABILITY_OOB off, allow-oob does not matter

  Error

(err2) exec-oob, QMP_CAPABILITY_OOB on, allow-oob: false

  Error

(exec-oob) exec-oob, QMP_CAPABILITY_OOB on, allow-oob: true

  Run in iothread / handle_qmp_command(), outside coroutine context

Peeking ahead to PATCH 3...  it split cases (exec):

(exec-co): execute, allow-oob does not matter, coroutine: true

  Run in main loop coroutine qmp_dispatcher_co(), in coroutine context,
  woken up by handle_qmp_command()

(exec): execute, allow-oob does not matter, coroutine: false

  Run in main loop bottom half do_qmp_dispatch_bh(), outside coroutine
  context, scheduled by qmp_dispatcher_co()

It appears not to touch case exec-oob.  Thus, coroutine: true has no
effect when the command is executed with exec-oob.

Looks like you're right :)

I can buy the argument "the two are conceptually orthogonal, although we
don't haven't found a use for one of the four cases".

Let's review the four combinations of the two flags once more:

* allow-oob: false, coroutine: false

  Handler runs in main loop, outside coroutine context.  Okay.

* allow-oob: false, coroutine: true

  Handler runs in main loop, in coroutine context.  Okay.

* allow-oob: true, coroutine: false

  Handler may run in main loop or in iothread, outside coroutine
  context.  Okay.

* allow-oob: true, coroutine: true

  Handler may run (in main loop, in coroutine context) or (in iothread,
  outside coroutine context).  This "in coroutine context only with
  execute, not with exec-oob" behavior is a bit surprising.

  We could document it, noting that it may change to always run in
  coroutine context.  Or we simply reject this case as "not
  implemented".  Since we have no uses, I'm leaning towards reject.  One
  fewer case to test then.

One more: this is a PEP 484 type hint.  With Python 3, we can use PEP
526 instead:

          options: List[str] =3D []

I think we should.

Inconsistent or grossly incomplete documentation can be worse than no
documentation.

Understand, and I therefore support the idea of exploring use of type
hints.  I'd rather not mix it up with other work, though.

Keeping just the function annotation is much less distracting.  I can't
reject that with a "separate patches for separate things" argument.

I'd still prefer not to, because:

* If we do add systematic type hints in the near future, then delaying
  this one until then shouldn't hurt your productivity.

* If we don't, this lone one won't help your productivity much, but
  it'll look out of place.

I really don't want us to add type hints as we go, because such
open-ended "while we touch it anyway" conversions take forever and a
day.  Maximizes the confusion integral over time.
