Ok, I should clarify. I don't want to do 100 individual serialized
round-trip request+reply, as that'd create latency on startup.
100 pipelined/parallelized request+reply would be ok, as you'll
not have the synchronization delay for each command.

Today the biggest cause of slow startup in libvirt, is issuing
something like 100+ serialized QMP calls to check status of
individual CPUID features. Possibly this is already just a libvirt
bug we can could just stuff all 100 qom-get queries down the pipe
in one go and have 1 wait for replies to arrive.
