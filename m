Public bug reported:

System/setup:
* MacBook Pro, macOS (any version from the last 2 years), external monitor.
* IDE on the laptop, emulator is used on the external monitor.

Currently, when starting the emulator from e.g. Android Studio or
IntelliJ IDEA, which is set to fullscreen mode on the laptop, which is
like it's own virtual desktop (Space) in macOS, what happens is this:

1. The virtual desktop (Space) on the laptop screen is switched because of =
#2. The reason is that only one window can be shown in Fullscreen this way.
2. The qemu splashscreen is shown for a few seconds, then it disappears. Th=
is is the reason for the virtual desktop switch. This splashscreen seems ac=
tually unnecessary to me, it has no value and it causes problems.
3. The actual emulator is shown, in my case on the external monitor (correc=
tly). I guess if the splashscreen would not be shown, the virtual desktop s=
witch would not happen, because the emulator would happen on the correct sc=
reen directly.

So maybe the splashscreen and the emulator window should be the same window=
, so that the OS can remember it's position being the same as the emulator?
Or maybe the splash could be disabled (by default? otherwise an update to I=
DEs would be necessary for the improved behavior?)
