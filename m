I've got the same issue. Had to rollback to 1809.

The working driver is named:
10.0.17763.1 (WinBuild.160101.0800) from 14th sept 2018

The non-working driver is:
10.0.18362.1 (WinBuild.160101.0800) from 18th march 2019

My versions (both tested):
$ /opt/qemu4/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 --version
QEMU emulator version 4.1.0

I'm not sure if this bug report should be reported to qemu tho. We
should probably file a bug report to Microsoft as well.

Title:
  HDA device non functional in Windows 10 1903

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I made the update to 1903, and the HDA device stopped working.

  The driver says the device is working correctly, but it does not.
  When I try to open the Windows sound configuration, the dialog hangs and =
never shows it's content.

  Several people reported this back in May:

  https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-v1903-ich6-ich9-virtio/

  I can confirm I have exactly the same problem.

  Host is Arch Linux, current (5.2.5) kernel, QEMU 4.0.

  I enabled HDA debug output and compared an older, working Windows
  version to 1903, but could not see the difference. The driver seems to
  issue the same verbs.

  I am happy to provide additional information if needed.
