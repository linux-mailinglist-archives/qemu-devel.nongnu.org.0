The company 'Arm' went through a rebranding some years back
involving a recapitalization from 'ARM' to 'Arm'. As a result
our documentation is a bit inconsistent between the two forms.
It's not worth trying to update everywhere in QEMU, but it's
easy enough to make docs/ consistent.

Note that "ARMv8" and similar architecture names, and
older CPU names like "ARM926" still retain all-caps.

I don't feel very strongly about this change, but it
looked a bit odd where earlier rearrangements in this
series meant that some documents had a mix of both styles,
so I thought I might as well fix all of docs/.
