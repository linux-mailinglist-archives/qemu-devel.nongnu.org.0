Title:
  qed leaked clusters

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  There are examples of two QED files which AFAIK does not have any
  errors both. But `qemu-img check` says that one of them has 1 leaked
  cluster.

  I wrote my own tool and it does not find any error. Both files
  attached, as well as debug output from my program.

  Both files are about 4G in size after unpacking. Unpack with `tar -S`
  to handle sparse files.

  And also, I know, that QED is deprecated, but anyway, seems qemu-img
  has bug.
