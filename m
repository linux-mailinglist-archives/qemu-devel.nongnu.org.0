The thing is, the cmd_id visible to the driver if the status is DONE
is the cmd_id value for DONE. So as long as the driver acknowledges
the value we could essentially start over the cmd_id without any
negative effect. The driver would have to put down a new descriptor to
start a block of hinting in order to begin reporting again so there
shouldn't be any risk of us falsely hinting pages that were in a
previous epoch.

Ugh, although now looking at it I think we might have a bug in the
QEMU code in that the driver could in theory force its way past a
"STOP" by just replaying the last command_id descriptor and then keep
going. Should be a pretty easy fix though as we should only allow a
transition to S_START if the status is S_REQUESTED/

Yeah, I kind of figured that would be the case. However if the name
change is not an issue then it should not be a problem.

Thanks.
