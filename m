No worries, I'm happy to discuss.

Yep, so something along the lines of this in `riscv_csrrw()`

if (cpu == "MyCustomCPU") {
    my_custom_csr[csrno].read();
}

So we check if using the CPU then apply extra CSR accesses.

I don't see how they will collide as we will only act on 1, based on
the CPU we are using.

Ok, so custom instructions are a whole different problem. I think we
should leave that for now and focus on CSRs.

A quick look though and I suspect we could do a similar CPU check in
decode_opc(). Dealing with the decodetree will be problematic though.

I honestly don't see a scenario where that happens. The maintenance
overhead and confusion of changing the CPUs at build time is too high.

I also don't think we should need that for CSR accesses. Custom
instructions are a whole different can of worms.

I'm not sure.
