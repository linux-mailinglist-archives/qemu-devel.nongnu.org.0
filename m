Supporting both options together in a non-idempotent way seems to
complicate things.

Would it be simpler to allow sve-max-vq only when there are no sve<bits>
options?

Alternatively, the two options would be defined so that their meanings
are independent of parse order.

So, way sve-max-vq=<max> means that:

 * all VQs up to max for which there is no corresponding sve<bits>=off,
   are enabled; and

 * VQ max is enabled; and

 * all VQs exceeding max are disabled.

While sve<bits>=(on|off) means

 * the VQ coresponding to <bits> is enabled (for on) or disabled (for
   off).
 
After parsing all the options, you check that the sve-max-vq and
sve<bits> optinos are consistent.  If you disallow duplicate sve-max-vq
or sve<bits> options, then there is no possibility of ambiguity and the
order or options doesn't matter.

(There may be constraints on the way qemu options parsing works that
make this hard, though...)

Having sve-max-vq in 128-bit units while sve<bits> are named in terms of
bit counts also feels a bit odd now.
