One use case is to do VM introspection all the time the guest is running.
From the user perspective, the pause/suspend/shutdown/snapshot/migrate
commands should work regardless if the VM is currently introspected
or not. Our first option was to delay these commands for a couple of
seconds when the VM is introspected, while the introspection app reverts
its changes, without blocking the vCPUs.

I'll see if we can mix the migrate notifier with migrate_add_blocker(),
or add a new migration state. To block the migration (with an error)
is our second option, because the user doing this might not be allowed
to stop the VM introspection.

Thank you,
Adalbert
