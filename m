If the information is cheap to retrieve, I think it is fine as part of
get-osinfo.

I am not a Windows expert, but I can imagine drivers have a more
uniquely identifiable ID than a human string.

What's the goal of this version reporting btw? to audit the VM? Isn't
there other mechanism to keep Windows systems up to date and alert
management layers? Perhaps that's Windows business/enterprise
solutions that are too expensive though, and we want something more
specific to qemu VMs.

glib has GRegexp.
