Public bug reported:

There exists a bug with Chelsio NICs T4 that causes the following error:

kvm: -device vfio-
pci,host=3D0000:83:00.7,id=3Dhostpci1.7,bus=3Dpci.0,addr=3D0x11.7: vfio
0000:83:00.7: hardware reports invalid configuration, MSIX PBA outside
of specified BAR

I was working with a downstream Proxmox developer to try to fix this
issue, and they provided me with the following change to make from line
1484 of hw/vfio/pci.c:

static void vfio_msix_early_setup(VFIOPCIDevice *vdev, Error **errp)
          * is 0x1000, so we hard code that here.
          */
         if (vdev->vendor_id =3D=3D PCI_VENDOR_ID_CHELSIO &&
-            (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x5800) {
+            ((vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x5800 ||
+             (vdev->device_id & 0xff00) =3D=3D 0x1425)) {
             msix->pba_offset =3D 0x1000;
         } else if (vdev->msix_relo =3D=3D OFF_AUTOPCIBAR_OFF) {
             error_setg(errp, "hardware reports invalid configuration, "

However, I found that this did not fix the issue, so the bug appears to
work differently than the one that was present on the T5 NICs which has
already been patched. I have attached the output of my lspci -nnkvv
