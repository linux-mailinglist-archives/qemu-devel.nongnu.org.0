Yes, it is device_finalize(). I'll update the comment.

I think it can be an error and we may assert the clock exists.

As for above, I think it can be considered an error. Should I remove the
errp and do an assert instead ?

Yes. I agree it is confusing.
This function just allow a a device 'A' to exhibit a clock from another
device 'B' (typically a composing sub-device, inside a soc like you
said). The device A is not supposed to interact with the clock itself.
The original sub-device is the true
owner/controller of the clock and is the only one which should use the
clock API: setting a callback on it (input clock); or updating the clock
frequency (output clock).
Basically, it just add the clock into the device clock namespace without
interfering with it.

Ok, I'll invert the arguments.

I'll try to clarify this and make the documentation more consistent with
the comments here.

I think container is confusing because depending on how we reason (clock
in a device; device in another device), we end up thinking the opposite.

Maybe we can use "exhibit" instead of "container" in the 2nd pair of
parameters, or prefix use "origin" or "owner" as a prefix for the first
pair of parameters.

It depends what we mean by "used by".
Original device can:
+ set the callback in case it is an input
+ update the frequency in case it is an output
But since an input clock can only be connected once,
I think the logic here is that any connection should now go through the
new device. But this is not checked and using one or the other is
exactly the same.

Maybe I misunderstood the meaning of qdev_pass_gpios().
