Three points stand out:

1. The alignment code is buggy, as mentioned in comment 15.

2. The iov_discard_undo() API has been added to "qemu/iov.h" to undo the
effect of iov_discard_front/back_undoable() calls before unmapping. You
can use this API to restore the originally mapped iovecs.

3. The device must follow the spec when handling invalid inputs. If the
spec is unclear then it's necessary to check actual hardware or infer
the behavior from code that is considered reference material (Linux
drivers, emulation code in BOCHS, etc).

Title:
  dma_blk_cb leaks memory map handles on misaligned IO

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Maintainer Edit:

  The functions in dma-helpers mismanage misaligned IO, badly enough to
  cause an infinite loop where no progress can be made. This allows the
  IDE state machine to get wedged such that cancelling DMA can fail;
  because the DMA helpers have bodged the state of the DMA transfer. See
  Comment #15 for the in-depth analysis.

  I've updated the name of this bug to reflect the current status as I
  understand it.

  Original report:

  Since upgrading to QEMU 2.8.0, my Windows 7 64-bit virtual machines
  started crashing due to the assertion quoted in the summary failing.
  The assertion in question was added by commit 9972354856 ("block: add
  BDS field to count in-flight requests").  My tests show that setting
  discard=3Dunmap is needed to reproduce the issue.  Speaking of
  reproduction, it is a bit flaky, because I have been unable to come up
  with specific instructions that would allow the issue to be triggered
  outside of my environment, but I do have a semi-sane way of testing that
  appears to depend on a specific initial state of data on the underlying
  storage volume, actions taken within the VM and waiting for about 20
  minutes.

  Here is the shortest QEMU command line that I managed to reproduce the
  bug with:

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0qemu-system-x86_64 \
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0-machine pc-i440fx-2.7,ac=
cel=3Dkvm \
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0-m 3072 \
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0-drive file=3D/dev/lvm/qe=
mu,format=3Draw,if=3Dide,discard=3Dunmap \
  =C2=A0-netdev tap,id=3Dhostnet0,ifname=3Dtap0,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno=
,vhost=3Don \
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0-device virtio-net-pci,ne=
tdev=3Dhostnet0 \
  =C2=A0-vnc :0

  The underlying storage (/dev/lvm/qemu) is a thin LVM snapshot.

  QEMU was compiled using:

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0./configure --python=3D/usr/bin/python2.7 --targe=
t-list=3Dx86_64-softmmu
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0make -j3

  My virtualization environment is not really a critical one and
  reproduction is not that much of a hassle, so if you need me to gather
  further diagnostic information or test patches, I will be happy to help.
