Hi Yan,

Yes to both feels the most consistent, right?  If we want the same
behavior between mmap'd and non-mmap'd regions, QEMU should drop both
writes.  Your change to memory_region_ram_device_write() drops the
write after tracing.  For both cases though it might be worthwhile to
have a separate trace recorded to indicate a dropped write, probably in
place of the normal trace to avoid confusion.  Thanks,

Alex
