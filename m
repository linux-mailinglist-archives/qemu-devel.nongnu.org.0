I think the split in three patches isn't too bad because it's not a
whole lot of code. But of course, it is little code that has lots of
implications which does make it hard to review. If we think that we
might bisect a bug in the series later, maybe it would be better to
split it into more patches.

write/write_zeroes has to be a single thing, I'm afraid. But I guess
read could be a separate patch, as could be copy_range. Not sure about
discard.

We already have too many unfinished conversions in QEMU, let's not add
one more.

Fortunately, we already have a tool that could help us here: Things like
bs->bl.max_pwrite_zeroes. We could make BDRV_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES the
default value and only drivers that override it can get bigger requests.

As above, I wouldn't update the default, but rather enable drivers to
overload the default with a larger value. This will involve changing
some places where we use MIN() between INT_MAX and the driver's value.

Makes sense to me.
