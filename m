Yep.

I would say that both 'getfd' and 'LISTEN_FDS' are explicitly controlled
by the user who owns the QEMU process. The former case the user has to
talk QMP, the latter case the user has to configure systemd units (or
an compatible impl). In both cases the user gets a free choice overing
the names associated with the FDs, though systemd gives some default
naming if the user doesn't specify a choice themselves.

Yeah, closefd and anything else that consumes thue result of 'getfd'
ought to continue to work.

getfd works in combination with socket FDs and thus SocketAddress.

We also have the add-fd QMP command which passes in file/block/char
based FDs that populate the /dev/fdset/NN  namespace, and thus used
by qemu_open().  Socket activation wouldn't overlap with this, since
as its name suggests the passed FDs are only targetting stream based
FDs, aka sockets or named FIFOs.

With regards,
Daniel
