I don't know if it's possible or not to emulate these accurately and use 
the FPU but nobody did it for QEMU so far. But if someone knows a way 
please speak up then we can try to implement it. Unfortunately this would 
require more detailed knowledge about different FPU implementations (at 
least X86_64, ARM and PPC that are the mostly used platforms) than what I 
have or willing to spend time to learn.

OK, then how about keeping the default accurate but allow to opt in to use 
FPU even if it's known to break some bits for workloads where users would 
need speed over accuracy and would be happy to live with the limitation. 
Note that i've found that just removing the define that disables hardfloat 
for PPC target makes VMX vector instructions faster while normal FPU is a 
little slower without any other changes so disabling hardfloat already 
limits performance for guests using VMX even when not using the FPU for 
cases when it would cause inaccuracy. If you say we want accuracy and 
don't care about speed, then just don't disable hardfloat as it helps at 
least VMX and then we can add option to allow the user to say we can use 
hardfloat even if it's inaccurate then they can test their workload and 
decide for themselves.
