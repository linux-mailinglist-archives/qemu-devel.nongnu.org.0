This does more than the commit message says. In addition to iterating
through filters instead of stopping, it also changes the semantics of
the function to return the next non-filter on top of bs instead of the
next node.

The block jobs seem to use it only for bdrv_is_allocated_above(), which
should return the same thing in both cases, so the behaviour stays the
same. qmp_block_commit() will check op blockers on a different node now,
which could be a fix or a bug, I can't tell offhand. Probably the
blocking doesn't really work anyway.

All of this should be mentioned in the commit message at least. Maybe
it's also worth splitting in two patches.

This could just use bs_below instead of recalculating the node if you
moved the declaration of bs_below to the function scope.
