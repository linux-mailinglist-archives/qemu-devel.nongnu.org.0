Yeap, I've alredy read that carefully, and I know for PPC now there is no
fast and correct way to
do hard float emulation, And my intention is to finding a possible way to
do fast and correct way to
do hard float emulation for PPC target at least under x86 host.

&gt;&gt; &gt; : because I don&#39;t have time to learn all the details need=
ed. I think :<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; others are in the same situation so unless somebody puts in t=
he :<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; necessary effort this won&#39;t change.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Which also had a proposed solution to the problem that you co=
uld try<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to implement, in particular see this message:<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt; amd Richard&#39;s reply immediately below that. In short to o=
ptimise FPU<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; emulation we would either find a way to compute inexact flag =
quickly<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; without reading the FPU status (this may not be possible) or =
somehow<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; get status from the FPU but the obvious way of claring the fl=
ag and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; reading them after each operation is too slow. So maybe using=
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; exceptions and only clearing when actually there&#39;s a chan=
ge could be<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; faster.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; As to how to use exceptions see this message in above thread:=
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; <a href=3D"https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/202=
0-03/msg00005.html" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://lists.nong=
nu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2020-03/msg00005.html</a><br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; But that&#39;s only to show how to hook in an exception handl=
er what it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; does needs to be implemented. Then tested and benchmarked.<br=
>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I still don&#39;t know where are the extensive PPC floating p=
oint tests to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; use for checking results though as that was never answered.<b=
r>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Specifically for PPC we don&#39;t have them. We use the softfloat =
test cases<br>
&gt;&gt; to exercise our softfloat/hardfloat code as part of &quot;make<br>
&gt;&gt; check-softfloat&quot;. You can also re-build fp-bench for each gue=
st target<br>
&gt;&gt; to measure raw throughput.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; However in short the problem is if the float_flag_inexact=
 is clear you<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; must use softfloat so you can properly calculate the inex=
act status. We<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can&#39;t take advantage of the inexact stickiness withou=
t loosing the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fidelity of the calculation.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; I still don&#39;t get why can&#39;t we use hardware via excep=
tion handler to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; detect flags for us and why do we only use hardfloat in some =
corner<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; cases. If reading the status is too costly then we could mirr=
or it in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a global which is set by an FP exception handler. Shouldn&#39=
;t that be<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; faster? Is there a reason that can&#39;t work?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; It would work but it would be slow. Almost every FP operation sets=
<br>
&gt;&gt; the inexact flag so it would generate an exception and exceptions =
take<br>
&gt;&gt; time to process.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For the guests where we use hardfloat operations with inexact alre=
ady<br>
&gt;&gt; latched is not a corner case - it is the common case which is why =
it<br>
&gt;&gt; helps.<br>
