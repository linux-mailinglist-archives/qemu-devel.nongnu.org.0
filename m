I want to insist on 8-byte alignment, so this should be at least 112.

Also, as pointed out in v7, use of the decoration '@header_length' and 
'@compression_type' is not consistent with the rest of the document. 
Drop the @.

One byte for the field is fine, but I'd still explicitly document 7 
bytes of unused padding, since I want to insist on an 8-byte multiple.
