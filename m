So the normal user (who does not explicitly use the freshly compiled binaries but the pre-built ones) will never experience any problem here. The Clang builds are (at least right now) rather only meant for us developers to check the sources from time to time with this compiler, to see whether it detects some additional issues compared to GCC.
