I'll improve it a little, but I'll add what I wrote above to the commit 
message.

I changed this a little to put all the args on the next line, which is 
slightly unusual but works okay.

I think that's a fine middle ground, because the alternative (to me) is 
to start using abstracted code generation tokens in a tree structure, 
etc etc etc.

Embedded templates are always gonna look kinda nasty, I think, because 
you're trying to fight style guidelines in two languages simultaneously 
and it's never gonna quite work out exactly how you want without some 
pretty complex abstraction mechanisms that are well beyond the power we 
need right now.
