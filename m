That's right

Let me premise that this patch fixes an important bug, so I am not
asking you to do any more work to get this patch committed right now :-)

But I think it would be good to test what would happen if the client did
a read on a directory with hundreds of entries, such as a maildir
directory. There has to be point where the number of directory entries
is larger than the shared buffer. What happens then?

I am guessing that we'll have to implement the "truncate at the
boundaries of individual entries" to get it right in all cases.

Given that it doesn't look like truncation would work right with
Rreaddir anyway today, I think it would be OK to fix it in a separate
patch.

I think the critical ones are Rread and Rreaddir. I wonder if we could
even reproduce a bug with any of the other 9p types. Probably not. So
returning an error might be good enough. Returning an error is also way
better than calling virtio_error or xen_9pfs_disconnect, more on this
below.

I thought so. Could you please update the comment in the code? As is it
is a bit confusing.

Yes I think you are right

The point I was trying to make is that it doesn't make a lot of sense to
try to do any operations after calling virtio_error. I am not a virtio
expert but certainly in the case of Xen below we cannot continue after
calling xen_9pfs_disconnect. The whole connection gets closed, more on
this below.

I think we have to return here because the connection gets closed by
xen_9pfs_disconnect. I wonder if we should return -EAGAIN like you
suggested instead of calling xen_9pfs_disconnect() which is
irrecoverable. But that could be done later in a separate patch.
