Thanks for the help on that.

I don't believe your split is actually bisectable -- there's a minimum amount
that is required to enable vector opcodes at all.  Patch 5 is the first that
enables tcg_out_{mov,ld,st}, so while patches beforehand may compile, they
certainly will not run.

I can retain your split, but for real bisectability we need to move the enable
of TCG_TARGET_HAS_v128 from patch 2 to patch 5.

Given that all this works for me on a Power9 host, I expect that there's a
simple fix for Mark's G5 host.  Given the above assertion, a missing opcode
definition, perhaps for -m32 vs -m64?
