Reverting the feature requires rough consensus and a patch.

I can provide a patch, but let's give everybody a chance to object
first.

I just did, and found next to nothing.

This is the final cover letter:

    qemu-sockets: add abstract UNIX domain socket support

    qemu does not support abstract UNIX domain
    socket address. Add this ability to make qemu handy
    when abstract address is needed.

Boils down to "$feature is needed because it's handy when it's needed",
which is less than helpful.

Patch history:

v1: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-04/msg03799.html

    This version repurposes @path starting with '@' for abstract
    sockets, always tight.  Only connect, no tests, no documentation.

    R-by Marc-Andr=C3=A9.

v2: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-04/msg03803.html

    Minor cleanup.

    Daniel asks why it's needed, points out listen is missing, and
    suggests the two boolean flags abstract, tight.

v3: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg02291.html

    Implement interface proposed by Daniel, default of @tight broken,
    tests (which don't catch the broken default), documentation.

    Eric suggests QAPI schema doc improvements (but doesn't challenge
    the interface).

    R-by Daniel for the code.  He asks for randomized @path in tests.

v4: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg04036.html

    Daniel points out style nits in tests.

    Eric suggests a few more QAPI schema doc improvements.

v5: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg04144.html

    R-by Daniel for the tests.

v6: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg04508.html

    No further review comments.

PR: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg05747.html

    Pull request catches my eye.  The interface looks odd, and I
    challenge @tight.  I silently accept Daniel's defense of it without
    digging deeper.

This is a review failure.  I do not blame the patch submitter.
