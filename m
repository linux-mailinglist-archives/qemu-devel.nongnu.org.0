Yes, I agree that we should try to use stable artifacts for the acceptance
tests.

to find the best solution. There are quite some files indeed in the
tests/acceptance directory,
almost a full framework on its own. In fact it could even be something to
consider, to make
./tests/acceptance a stand-alone framework when avocado isn't used anymore
in the future?

Thanks for your extensive reply Philippe. Looking forward to hear what the
outcome is on that with the discussions at the KVM forum.

We discussed about this again last year at the KVM forum. Various<br>
RFE have been filled:<br>

What we need is a QEMU community file server similar to the asset<br>
one used by the Avocado community. The problem is who is going to<br>
pay and sysadmin it. IIRC Gerd suggested to use GitLab Page, but<br>
the artifact file size is limited to a maximum of 1GiB:<br>

gitlab-pages</a><br>
Alternative is to use a git-lfs server:<br>

This is now a project management problem.<br>

store them there in a sub-directory, that should work. Perhaps people from<=

Next week is the KVM forum 2020 and there might be a BoF session<br>
to talk about that:<br>

Now that the QEMU community started to use gitlab-ci more and more<br>
I received complains that Avocado is not practical (hard to<br>
understand how to reproduce command line to debug, options to use<br>
not clear, timeouts not clear, why download all artifacts to run<br>
a single test, various issues regarding caching, cache filled /home<br>
filesystem) so I have been asked to look at Avocado alternatives,<br>
because we want contributors run more tests and CI, not them be<br>
scared by it. <br></blockquote><blockquote class=3D"gmail_quote" style=3D"m=

I haven&#39;t looked at alternatives yet, from the various features<br>
we could have use, the biggest one is the ability to interact with<br>
the serial console. And that feature is duplicated with the VM<br>
testing class: tests/vm/basevm.py.<br>
The SSH session used in linux_ssh_mips_malta.py is similar to the<br>
one from basevm.py too (see &#39;make vm-boot-ssh-%&#39;).<br>
Some tests are not &#39;acceptance&#39; but simple qtest written in Python,=
<br>
such cpu_queries.py / pc_cpu_hotplug_props.py / migration.py /<br>
pc_cpu_hotplug_props.py / x86_cpu_model_versions.py.<br>
<br>
The classes I find practical are downloading artifact, uncompressing<br>
or extracting archive, and eventually the cloudinit one. But we can <br>
probably use them directly.<br>
<br></blockquote><div>Interesting to hear that. Yeah that is probably a big=
 task that takes time<br></div><div>to find the best solution. There are qu=
ite some files indeed in the tests/acceptance directory,</div><div>almost a=
 full framework on its own. In fact it could even be something to consider,=
 to make</div><div>./tests/acceptance a stand-alone framework when avocado =
