Why would you have properties defined as function calls for the same
object that uses the array?

I'm not entirely sure what you mean with allow-set. The only things I
can find are related to link properties, specifically the check()
callback of object_class_property_add_link(). If it's this, what would
be the problem with just adding it to DEFINE_PROP_LINK instead of
using a separate function call to define link properties?

You mean dynamic per-object properties, i.e. not class properties?

I think having different ways for different things (class vs. object) is
better than having different ways for the same things (class in qdev vs.
class in non-qdev).

This was the obvious incremental step forward at the time because you
just had to replace one function call with another function call. The
commit message doesn't explain that not using data was a conscious
decision. I think it would probably have been out of scope then.

I don't think we should parse any C code. In my opinion, both
introspection and the array should eventually be generated by the QAPI
generator from the schema.
