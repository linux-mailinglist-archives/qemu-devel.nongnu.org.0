Oh I just remembered one thing, that Linux should be zeroing pages when
allocating, so even if the page has legacy content it'll be cleared with
__GFP_ZERO allocations.  So yeah it would be harder to have issue at least with
a sensible OS.  I'm not sure about Windows or others, but it could be a common
case.  Then the only overhead is the extra pages we kept in the live snapshot,
which takes some more disk space.

Or there could be firmware running without OS at all, but it should really not
read unallocated pages assuming there must be zero.  It's not a sane behavior
even for a firmware.

Right.  We'll need to rework the design but just for saving a bunch of snapshot
image disk size.  So now I agree with you, let's keep this in mind, but maybe
it isn't worth a fix for now, at least until we figure something really broken.

Andrey, do you think we should still mention this issue into the todo list of
the wiki page of live snapshot?
