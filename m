Basically yes. In case of Python 2, it's not a QEMU feature that we
remove here, but a build requirement, and we tell the users that we need
at least Python 3.5 when they run "configure", so I'm not sure whether
that needs to be explicitely mentioned again the docs beside our ChangeLog?

I also once started a page in the Wiki here:

 https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/RemovedFeatures

... but apparently, it did not get enough attention yet, otherwise you
would have noticed it before introducing the new chapter into the
qemu-doc ...

We definitely need one spot where we can document removed features. I
don't mind which way we do it, either the qemu-doc or the wiki, but we
should unify on one of the two. I guess the qemu-doc is the better place
since we are tracking the deprecated features there already and one more
or less just has to move the text to the other chapter when things get
finally removed?
