Hi Igor,

(+Brijesh)

long-ish pondering ahead, with a question at the end.

I haven't written any OVMF code for this yet, but I've spent a few hours
thinking about it. Progress! :)

So, this looks really promising.

I'm commenting now for summarizing my thoughts before I write the --
initially minimal -- counterpart patches in OVMF.

There is one complication that deserves this separate email, and that's
SEV's effect on the SMM save state map. It is the topic of the following
edk2 commit range:

  1  61a044c6c15f OvmfPkg/MemEncryptSevLib: find pages of initial SMRAM
                  save state map
  2  86defc2c2575 OvmfPkg/PlatformPei: SEV: allocate pages of initial
                  SMRAM save state map
  3  5ef3b66fec13 OvmfPkg/SmmCpuFeaturesLib: SEV: encrypt+free pages of
                  init. save state map
  4  5e2e5647b9fb OvmfPkg/AmdSevDxe: decrypt the pages of the initial
                  SMRAM save state map

For performing the initial SMBASE relocation, QEMU+KVM have to read the
save state map from guest RAM. For that, under SEV, the guest RAM has to
be decrypted before, and re-encrypted after. Meanwhile, the guest RAM
(while decrypted) should not leak other (unrelated) information to the
hypervisor.

Therefore the above edk2 commits implement the following procedure:

(a.1) in OvmfPkg/PlatformPei, the page in which the save state map
      exists, is allocated away from other firmware components

(a.2) in AmdSevDxe, which runs early in the DXE phase (via APRIORI DXE
      file), we decrypt the page in question

(a.3) PiSmmCpuDxeSmm, after it performs the initial SMBASE relocation,
      calls a hook in SmmCpuFeaturesLib -- and in that hook, we
      re-encrypt the page, and also release (free) it for other uses
      (firmware and OS both)

Clearly, the above conflicts (or at least intersects) with reserving
128KB (32 pages) at 0x3_0000, i.e. at [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF], forever,
from the OS. (That area is going to be locked to SMM, and so the OS
should see from the UEFI memmap that it should not touch it.) The
conflict exists because the save state map is in the last kilobyte of
page#15 (from said pages #0..#31) -- the save state map is at
[0x3_FC00..0x3_FFFF].

So here's my plan:

(b.1) In PlatformPei, probe the QEMU feature by writing 0xFF to register
      0x9C, and reading back 0x01. If the feature is available, then:

(b.1.1) set a new dynamic PCD to TRUE

(b.1.2) allocate away (as reserved memory) the range
        [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF]

(b.2) In PlatformPei, conditionalize the current, SEV-specific,
      allocation of the save state map, on the PCD being FALSE.
      (Modifying (a.1).) This will prevent a conflicting
      double-allocation (double coverage by memory allocation HOBs)

(b.3) In AmdSevDxe, don't touch the decryption of the save state map
      (a.2)

(b.4) in the SmmCpuFeaturesLib hook, preserve the re-encryption of the
      save state map (part of (a.3))

(b.5) in the SmmCpuFeaturesLib hook, conditionalize the freeing of the
      save state map, on the PCD being FALSE. (Modifying (a.3).) This
      will prevent a hole from being punched in the allocation that
      covers [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF], and the entire allocation will
      survive into OS runtime.

The above steps ensure that, while the decrypt/encrypt steps prevail,
the save state map allocations will be ingested by the larger, and
longer-term,  [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF] allocation.

Furthermore:

(b.6) Extend SmmAccessDxe to write 0x02 to register 0x9C, in an
      EFI_DXE_MM_READY_TO_LOCK_PROTOCOL notification callback, if the
      PCD is true. This will cause the [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF] area to be
      locked down at the same time with the rest of SMRAM (i.e., TSEG).

(b.7) Extend SmmAccessDxe to save S3 boot script opcodes for writing
      0x02 to register 0x9C, if the PCD is true. This makes sure that
      the above lockdown will occur also during S3 resume, before the OS
      is reached. (The S3 boot script is executed *after* SMBASE
      relocation and TSEG locking, during S3 resume.)

Considering (b.6) and (b.7), the "lockdown on normal boot" (from (b.6))
could actually be merged into (b.5) -- we don't necessarily have to
delay the normal boot lockdown of [0x3_0000..0x4_FFFF] until platform
BDS signals EFI_DXE_MM_READY_TO_LOCK_PROTOCOL; we could do it right
after initial SMBASE relocation.

However: I'd really like to keep (b.6) and (b.7) together, in the same
driver, and (b.7) is really inappropriate for PiSmmCpuDxeSmm (into which
SmmCpuFeaturesLib is linked). For writing S3 boot script opcodes in
(b.7), we need another protocol notify (on EFI_S3_SAVE_STATE_PROTOCOL),
and sneaking that kind of callback into PiSmmCpuDxeSmm sounds really
bad. Hence I plan to add both (b.6) and (b.7) to SmmAccessDxe.

I'll report back with my findings; just wanted to give a heads-up (to
myself as well :))

Finally: can you please remind me why we lock down 128KB (32 pages) at
0x3_0000, and not just half of that? What do we need the range at
[0x4_0000..0x4_FFFF] for?

Thanks!
Laszlo
