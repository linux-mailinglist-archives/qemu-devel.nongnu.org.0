I acknowledge your opinion.

CLI usability for humans matters.  We're not doing well there.

A big part of the usability problem is complexity.

"Correcting" the user's configuration makes the CLI *more* complex.
Even worse when done deep down in the bowels of board code, because that
can only lead to inconsistency between machines.

The error message for a memory size we can't support could perhaps be
more helpful.

Good defaults are important.  The default memory size for sam460ex looks
okay to me.

If this commit changed the CLI, I'd gladly document your opinion /
opposition in the commit message.  But it doesn't.  It merely deletes
unreachable code because it's buggy.

I'm not going to add unreachable code in the hope it may someday be
needed, sorry.

Refactoring the helper when we actually *have* a need is much more
likely to result in a helper that satisfies them.
