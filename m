In that case we should have no-user anyway and the device has to be 
instantiated by board code so then assert is enough to avoid error in 
board code. More complex way to describe dependencies may only be needed 
if we want to allow dynamic creation of new boards via the command line 
which was the original idea but that's quite a long way away if possible 
at all so I would not worry about that at this point.
