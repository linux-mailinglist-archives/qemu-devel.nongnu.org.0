I'd like to re-iterate that the necessity to keep node names same on
both sides of migration is unexpected, undocumented and in some cases
impossible.

If you want to mandate that they must be kept the same please document
it and also note the following:

- during migrations the storage layout may change e.g. a backing chain
  may become flattened, thus keeping node names stable beyond the top
  layer is impossible

- in some cases (readonly image in a cdrom not present on destination,
  thus not relevant here probably) it may even become impossible to
  create any node thus keeping the top node may be impossible

- it should be documented when and why this happens and how management
  tools are supposed to do it

- please let me know what's actually expected, since libvirt
  didn't enable blockdev yet we can fix any unexpected expectations

- Document it so that the expectations don't change after this.

- Ideally node names will not be bound to anything and freely
  changeable. If necessary we can provide a map to qemu during migration
  which is probably less painful and more straightforward than keeping
  them in sync somehow ...
