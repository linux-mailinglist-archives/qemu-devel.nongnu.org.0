Fix is wrong as we use ~0 as the placeholder for variable payload, not 0.

With that fixed we hit new fun paths - after some errors we get the
worrying - not totally sure but looks like a failure on an error cleanup.
I'll chase down the error source, but even then this is probably triggerable by
hardware problem or similar.  Some bonus prints in here from me chasing
error paths, but it's otherwise just cxl/next + the fix I posted earlier today.
