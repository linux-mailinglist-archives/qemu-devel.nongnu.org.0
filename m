You're right, this is missing a ctz32().

I'm trying to describe e.g. LDP, which if not within16 has two 8-byte elements, one or 
both of which must be atomic.  We will have set MO_ATOM_WITHIN16 | MO_ATMAX_8.

If atmax == size, there is only one element, and since it is not within16, there is no 
atomicity.

If the LDP is aligned mod 8, but not aligned mod 16, then both 8-byte operations must be 
(separately) atomic, and we return MO_64.

... whereas returning -MO_64 tells the caller that we must handle an unaligned atomic

We don't handle multiple mappings at all well.  There is an outstanding bug report about 
read+write vs read+execute mappings for a jit -- our write-protect scheme for flushing TBs 
does not work for that case.

Since we can't detect the multiple mappings at this point, I'm tempted to ignore it.
But you're correct that we could drop this check and let start_exclusive handle it.
