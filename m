Yes.

See the answer below the next paragraph.

The v1 of this driver did re-add memory backends automatically after
a reboot, so if that's something that is desirable it can be re-introduced
without much difficulty.

The issue here is that the guest might never re-connect to the DM protocol
interface after a reboot (perhaps because the VM was rebooted from
a Windows to a Linux guest).
In this case the driver would wait endlessly, not letting the
underlying memory backends to be removed.

virtio-mem also seems to unplug all blocks unconditionally when the VM is
rebooted.

On the other hand, actually resizing the guest boot memory is definitely
not trivial - for sure that's something for future work
(virtio-mem might also benefit from it).

Thanks!

Thanks for the pointer, however the {G,Q}Tree import explicitly excludes
these tree operations that this driver needs (as they currently don't
have any callers in QEMU).

So in this case either they would have to be imported too or the driver
would need QEMU being built with the upstream Glib (as far as I can see,
[1] says this will still be possible with glib >= 2.76.0).

Thanks,
Maciej
