Yes.

Does this really serve to benefit our users though ? As noted, this
will have no benefit to any mgmt app using libvirt, as it'll still
explicitly set 'pc' by default. So we only impact basic users who
are relying on QEMU's built-in defaults.

It feels like the arguments for removing the machine type default
apply equally to other aspects of QEMU defaults. ie lets make
-cpu, -accel, -m, -smp, and -display mandatory too, since the
defaults might not be right for some users ?

Daniel
