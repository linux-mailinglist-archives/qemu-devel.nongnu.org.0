Several attempts have been made to bring the functionality to QMP.
Sadly, they went nowhere.

I posted an analysis of the issues in reply to one of the more serious
attempts:

I'd like to hear your take on it.  I append the relevant part for your
convenience.  Perhaps your code is already close to what I describe
there.  I'm interested in where it falls short.

Yes, this is one of the issues.  Glad you're addressing it.

Another one.  Glad again.

Does this mean you're trying to use the jobs infrastructure?

Relevant part of Message-ID: <87lh7l783q.fsf@blackfin.pond.sub.org>

If we can't make a sane QMP interface, I'd rather have no QMP interface.
However, I believe we *can* make a sane QMP interface if we put in the
design work.

The design work must start with a review of what we're trying to
accomplish, and how to fit it into the rest of the system.  Here's my
attempt.  Since my knowledge on snapshots is rather superficial, I'm
cc'ing Kevin for additional snapshot expertise.  Kevin, please correct
me when I talk nonsense.  I'm further cc'ing Eric and Peter for the
management layer perspective.

A point-in-time snapshot of a system consists of a snapshot of its
machine state and snapshots of its storage.  All the snapshots need to
be made at the same point in time for the result to be consistent.

Snapshots of read-only storage carry no information and are commonly
omitted.

Isolated storage snapshots can make sense, but snapshotting the machine
state without also snapshotting the machine's storage doesn't sound
useful to me.

Both storage and machine state snapshots come in two flavours: internal
and external.

External ones can be made with any block backend, but internal storage
snapshots work only with certain formats, notably qcow2.  QMP supports
both kinds of storage snapshots.

Both kinds of storage snapshots need exclusive access while they work.
They're relatively quick, but the delay could be noticable for large
internal snapshots, and perhaps for external snapshots on really slow
storage.

Internal machine state snapshots are currently only available via HMP's
savevm, which integrates internal machine state and storage snapshots.
This is non-live, i.e. the guest is stopped while the snapshot gets
saved.  I figure we could make it live if we really wanted to.  Another
instance of the emerging background job concept.

On the implementation level, QCOW2 can't currently store a machine state
snapshot without also storing a storage snapshot.  I guess we could
change this if we really wanted to.

External machine state snapshots are basically migrate to file.
Supported by QMP.

Live migration to file is possible, but currently wastes space, because
memory dirtied during migration gets saved multiple times.  Could be
fixed either by making migration update previously saved memory instead
of appending (beware, random I/O), or by compacting the file afterwards.

Non-live migration to file doesn't waste space that way.

To take multiple *consistent* snapshots, you have to bundle them up in a
transaction.  Transactions currently support only *storage* snapshots,
though.

Work-around for external machine state snapshot: migrate to file
(possibly live), leaving the guest sopped on completion, take storage
snapshots, resume guest.

You can combine internal and external storage snapshots with an external
machine state snapshot to get a mixed system snapshot.

You currently can't do that with an internal machine state snapshot: the
only way to take one is HMP savevm, which insists on internally
snapshotting all writable storage, and doesn't transact together with
external storage snapshots.

Except for the case "purely internal snapshot with just one writable
storage device", a system snapshot consists of multiple parts stored in
separate files.  Tying the parts together is a management problem.  QEMU
provides rudimentary management for purely internal snapshots, but it's
flawed: missing storage isn't detected, and additional storage can creep
in if snapshot tags or IDs happen to match.  I guess managing the parts
is better left to the management layer.

I figure a fully general QMP interface would let you perform a system
snapshot by combining storage snapshots of either kind with either kind
of machine state snapshot.

We already have most of the building blocks: we can take external and
internal storage snapshots, and combine them in transactions.

What's missing is transactionable machine state snapshots.

We know how to work around it for external machine state snapshots (see
above), but a transaction-based solution might be nicer.

Any solution for internal machine state snapshots in QMP should at least
try to fit into this.  Some restrictions are okay.  For instance, we
probably need to restrict internal machine state snapshots to piggyback
on an internal storage snapshot for now, so we don't have to dig up
QCOW2 just to get QMP support.

We can talk about more convenient interfaces for common special cases,
but I feel we need to design for the general case.  We don't have to
implement the completely general case right away, though.  As long as we
know where we want to go, incremental steps towards that goal are fine.

Can we create a transactionable QMP command to take an internal machine
state snapshot?

This would be like HMP savevm with the following differences:

* Separate parameters for tag and ID.  I'll have none of this
  overloading nonsense in QMP.

* Specify the destination block device.  I'll have none of this "pick a
  device in some magic, undocumented way" in QMP.

* Leave alone the other block devices.  Adding transaction actions to
  snapshot all the writable block devices to get a full system snapshot
  is the user's responsibility.

Limitations:

* No live internal machine snapshot, yet.

* The storage device taking the internal snapshot must also be
  internally snapshot for now.  In fact, the command does both
  (tolerable wart).

Open questions:

* Do we want the QMP command to delete existing snapshots with
  conflicting tag / ID, like HMP savevm does?  Or do we want it to fail
  the transaction?

* Do we need transactions for switching to a system snapshot, too?

Opinions?
