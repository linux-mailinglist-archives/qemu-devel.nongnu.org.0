Hmm the patch I am seeing though says that it

"reflects back the list of configured -audiodev command line options".

Maybe we are saying the same thing, but maybe we aren't,
what we are actually trying to achieve is to probe which audiodev drivers are available, either built-in or loaded as modules.
Same for display, block, etc.

You are instead trying to fetch the command line options?
