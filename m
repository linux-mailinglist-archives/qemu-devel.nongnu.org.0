SEV-ES has pre-launch measurement and secret injection, just like SEV
(except that the measurement includes the initial states of all vcpus,
that is, their VMSAs.  BTW that means that in order to calculate the
measurement the Attestation Server must know exactly how many vcpus are
in the VM).

If we have an alternative channel (vsock?) and a proxy on the host,
maybe we can share parts of the solution between SEV and SNP.

Launch the VM with -S (suspended; so it doesn't actually begin running
guest instructions).

Note that libvirt holds the QMP socket to QEMU.  So whoever fetches the
measurement needs either (a) to ask libvirt to it; or (b) to connect to
another QMP listening socket for getting the measurement and injecting
the secret.

In Kata, Jim Cadden (cc'd) worked on adding this second QMP socket (if
I'm not mistaken) to the kata-runtime (which is the process that starts
QEMU and later controls it with QMP).

On top of what's written above, note that with direct boot (with
-kernel/-initrd/-append) the hashes of these 3 elements may be inserted
into the guest measurement (with kernel-hashes=on option on object
sev-guest; upcoming in QEMU 6.2).  This means that the Attestation
Server must know the OVMF hash as well as the hashes of kernel, initrd,
and cmdline in order to construct the expected measurement.
