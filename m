How about:


If you are able to, it will greatly facilitate bug triage if you attempt
to reproduce the problem with the latest qemu.git master built from
source. See https://www.qemu.org/download/#source for instructions on
how to do this.

QEMU generally supports the last two releases advertised on
https://www.qemu.org/. Problems with distro-packaged versions of QEMU
older than this should be reported to the distribution instead.


- I put an emphasis on facilitate (It's in YOUR interest to do this.)
- I rephrased "if an attempt is made to" to "if you attempt to", a less
   passive (and shorter) sentence.
