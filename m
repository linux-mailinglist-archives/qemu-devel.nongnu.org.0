Only one arch is affected, but it's sparc64, not sparc.

Title:
  qemu 4.0.0 broken by glib update

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  In brief, an install CD will successfully boot with qemu 4.0.0 built with=
 glib 2.58.3, but freeze during boot with qemu 4.0.0 built with glib 2.60.0=
. I tracked it down to glib's GHashTable improvements. qemu is happy with a=
 glib built from
  ```
   git checkout -f 2.60.4
   git revert --no-edit 86c6f7e2b..3bed8a13b
   git revert --no-edit 75f8ec1df9b48b0c3a13a9125f2c7d7c5adf5159
   git revert --no-edit 603fb5958..d3074a748
   git revert --no-edit 0b45ddc55..0600dd322
  ```
  When the GHashTable improvements were committed, there was already a pree=
mptive note about any breakage being due to using private implementation de=
tails, hence mentioning it here rather than with glib.
