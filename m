Re-thinking about this...

QEMU VMPort interface was quite broken already (See first patch in 
series "hw/i386/vmport: Propagate IOPort read to vCPU EAX register").
The introduction of that fix already changes the result of all existing 
commands from guest perspective which relied on return-value from 
vmport_ioport_read().
E.g. CMD_GETVERSION and CMD_GETRAMSIZE.

In theory, we should have also made that bug-fix be tied to 
machine-type. To similarly avoid the issue of migrating a VM from a 
working VMPort command implementation to a non-working one.
i.e. In case of migrating from new QEMU to old QEMU. Do we wish to 
create a property-flag for that fix as-well? Or can we just drop all the 
machine-type flags alltogether (Including the suggested "commands-v2")
and declare this the first actually working VMPort implementation?
