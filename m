You could turn it into a scary warning for a few releases first.

The reason I suggested virtio-mmio was because it's not enumerable; it's
a fixed location; so you just check that the device you have there is
what you expect.
It means not inventing a new qemu device (although you would have to
make it addable on x86, and you would have to make it hideable in SMM).
(pci with preallocated addresses is similar).

While the hw can change from boot to boot on qemu, there's no
requirement that as a bios you respect that;  just state where you want
the device.
