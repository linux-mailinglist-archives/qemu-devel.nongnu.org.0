WARL is Write Any Read Legal.  Essentially it means that the hardware gets to
decide what sort of behavior that field has, and is the mechanism for optional
features in the ISA.  In this case it'd be entirely within spec, specifically:

    Registers mcounteren and scounteren are WARL registers that must be
    implemented if U-mode and S-mode are implemented. Any of the bits may
    contain a hardwired value of zero, indicating reads to the corresponding
    counter will cause an illegal instruction exception when executing in a
    less-privileged mode.

Taking a patch that matches the out-of-spec FU540 behavior doesn't make any
sense, I don't want to implement errata in QEMU :)
