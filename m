There's no problem to solve, just trying to understand better what are the 
valid options. It's already possible to enable multiple patterns with 
either events=file or repeating -trace options (with or without enable=) 
so that's already sufficient, I was just curious what other options are 
there and if there's a simpler way that we could document. If not, using 
the current ways that are now documented is OK I think.

I guess we have enough expressiveness with current pattern matching and 
globs are more easily understood by mere users so regex may not be needed 
here.

That would be (even more) confusing so better to just stay with globs.
