When using qemu-img to convert an image that is hosted on an HTTP
server to some faster local (or pseudo-local) storage, the overall
performance can be improved by reading data from the HTTP server in
larger blocks and by caching and re-using blocks already read. This
set of patches implements both of these, and adds a further patch
allowing an offset to be added to all of the HTTP requests.

The first patch (block/curl: Add an 'offset' parameter, affecting all
range requests) allows the user to add an arbitrary offset to all
range requests sent to the HTTP server. This is useful if the image to
be read from the HTTP server is embedded in another file (for example
an uncompressed tar file). It avoids the need to first download the
file containing the source image and extract it (both of which will
require writing the image to local storage). It is logically distinct
from the rest of the patches and somewhat use-case specific.

The remaining patches implement block based retrieval of data from the
HTTP server and, optionally, caching of those blocks in memory.

The existing HTTP implementation simply reads whatever data is
requested by the caller, with the option for a user-specified amount
of readahead. This is poor for performance because most IO requests
(from QCOW2, for example) are for relatively small amounts of data,
typically no more than 64kB. This does not allow the underlying TCP
connections to achieve peak throughput.

The existing readhead mechanism is also intended to work in
conjunction with the HTTP driver's attempt to piggy-back a new IO
request on one that is already in flight. This works, but is often
defeated because it relies on the existing IO request *completely*
satisfying any subsequent request that might piggy-back onto it. This
is rarely the case and, particularly when used with "readahead", can
result in the same data being downloaded repeatedly.

The observed performance will depend greatly on the environment, but
when using qemu-img to retrieve a 1GiB QCOW2 image from an HTTPS
server, the following was observed:

| approach                                   | time (hh:mm:ss) |
|--------------------------------------------+-----------------|
| QCOW2 over HTTPS (existing implementation) |        00:00:59 |
| 256kB blocks, 8 cached blocks              |        00:00:42 |
| 2MB blocks, 100 cached blocks              |        00:00:34 |

By way of comparison, aria2c (a dedicated HTTP download client) can
retrieve the same image in 19 seconds. Obviously this is without any
QCOW2 layer.
