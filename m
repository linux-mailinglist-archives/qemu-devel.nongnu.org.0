And this, I claim, is wrong.

If you can generate C for the operation out of line, then you can interpret it
inline as well.  Or, make a reasonable decision about what bit to be out of
line and what bit to be a helper.

There certainly is a way to know what the effective address is.  From the
pseudo-code that I browsed today, "EA = foo" is a big clue.

There certainly is a way to know if the instruction is predicated.  From the
pseudo-code that I browsed today,

  if (pred) {
    operation;
  } else {
    NOP;
  }

is the clue, vs

  Rd = mux(Pu, Rs, Rt).

Of course there are insns where !Pd is used; that doesn't change anything.

I think that we can do the store immediately -- I give specifics above.  Do you
have a counter-example?  Admittedly I'm new to browsing the architecture, but I
don't see a legal packet for which you can't just Store Now.

Ok, vscatter is indeed complex.  But I still count 6 operands.  Is it the
"slot" one that you're concerned is the 7th?  I don't see that as strictly
necessary, since this can only be in slot 0.
