worth calling out that trailing , are not allowed?

Is the 'expression A;' a copy-paste from RFC text, irrelevant to our

Is that always true for all directives?

Would it be worth reformulating as something like:

SCHEMA =3D DIRECTIVE... DEFINITION...

allowing zero-or-more of either, but where directives come first?

This has matched {}, but looks wrong.  I think you meant

PRAGMA =3D { 'pragma': { '*doc-required': BOOL,
                       '*returns-whitelist': [ STRING, ... ],
                       '*name-case-whitelist': [ STRING, ... ] } }

As written (and enforced by current code), we don't allow 2-d arrays; if
we ever decide we need that, we'd rewrite to ARRAY-TYPE =3D [ ARRAY-TYPE =
]

Down the road, we'll probably be amending this line:

 | STRING : { 'type': TYPE-REF, '*if': COND, '*default': VALUE }

with appropriate documentation on how VALUE must match type.

This syntactically allows zero or more branches per the intro, but in
code we semantically require at least one.  Is that a problem?

Is it worth trying to represent one-or-more in the grammar, in a
different manner than zero-or-more?

We may eventually relax that to permit another union, hopefully we
remember to fix the docs when doing so.

We've already had patches proposed for relaxing that to allow an
optional discriminator as a way to select a default branch.  They'll
have to be rebased on top of this.

Should this read 'guarded by #if STRING for each STRING in the COND list'=
?

Not this patch's problem - but we are inconsistent between x.y and x.y.z.=


There are a couple of typo or grammar fixes worth fixing, but I'm
comfortable enough giving:
