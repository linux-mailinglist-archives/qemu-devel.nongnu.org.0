Yes, there is a fair bit of conceptual overlap there. Main difference is
probably that we'd want to be a bit more fine grained than the MAINTAINERS
file shows, but that seems doable. 

Also somewhat related here is our security classification where we say we'll
only consider bugs security vulnerabilities if they are in components that
are targetted towards virtualization uses (ie KVM), and consider anything to
do with non-virtualization use cases to be plain bugs, not security bugs.
While as developers we can probably say which is which, for end users and
bug reporter this is not so clear. So if we're going to classify support
status for components, we should try to add a classification for security
status at the same time.

Daniel
