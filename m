Ubuntu has shipped SDL 2 for a long time now, for 16.04 and before.

We do indeed based deprecations off our suppported build platform
targets as defined here:

  https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html#Supported-build-platforms

As above, Ubuntu has shipped SDL2 for a long time already, so removing
SDL 1.2 was considered to not be a problem.

In the absence of more info, I'm not seeing a compelling reason to
undelete SDL 1.2, given all our supported build platforms ship SDL 2

Daniel
