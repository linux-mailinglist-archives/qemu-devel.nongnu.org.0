Not really, in general we want users to keep updated with latest
supported Fedora releases and not use EOL versions from archive.=20
The critical reason for archives.fp.org to exist is license,
beyond that its largely just a historical record, but we digress
off topic here...

I spoke with some folks I know who didn't have an answer on the impact
or policy around using archive.fp.org, but did point out that there's
a way to avoid breaking

The Fedora mirror manager software provides a URL to query what
sites currently host a given version

eg to find Fedora 16 for x86_64 fetch this

  https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?repo=3Dfedora-16&arch=3Dx8=
6_64

whereupon it reports something like this:

# repo =3D fedora-16 arch =3D x86_64 country =3D DK country =3D DE countr=
y =3D UA country =3D global=20
https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fedora-buffet/archive/fedora/linux/releases/16=
/Everything/x86_64/os/
https://fedora-archive.ip-connect.info/fedora/linux/releases/16/Everythin=
g/x86_64/os/
https://ftp-stud.hs-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/archive.fedoraproject.org/fe=
dora/linux/releases/16/Everything/x86_64/os/
https://fedora-archive.ip-connect.vn.ua/fedora/linux/releases/16/Everythi=
ng/x86_64/os/
http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/linux/fedora-archive/fedora/linux/releases/16/=

http://fedora-archive.mirror.liquidtelecom.com/archive/fedora/linux/relea=
ses/16/Everything/x86_64/os/
http://mirrors.kernel.org/fedora-buffet/archive/fedora/linux/releases/16/=
Everything/x86_64/os/
http://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/fedora-archive/fedora/linux/releases=

s/16/Everything/x86_64/os/
https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/16/Everyth=
ing/x86_64/os/

any one of those returned URLs should serve the content we want. It is
interesting to see that there's several mirrors still carrying ancient
software, despite 'download.fp.org' returning 404

Admittedly this extra redirection is a bit more tedious for the test
suite, but we could hide that behind a common helper function.

Daniel
