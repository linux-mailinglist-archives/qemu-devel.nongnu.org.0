Ah, will fix.

Yeah, I first felt strange adding "Fabrice and the QEMU Project
developers".  But as you've guessed I just picked what you used for
'qemu-block-drivers.7'.  That's why I mentioned Dan and his original
commit ID in my commit message, for clear posterity.

As Dan says in his follow-up, a file indeed usually gets modified over
time.  And given the follow-up interaction between you and Dan, in the
next iteration, I'll change it to: "The QEMU Project developers".

(While I agree that we should be careful to not mix attribution changes
with the noise of rST conversion, maybe in this case a seperate commit
is an overkill; hope it is okay if I call it out in the commit message.)

Yeah, as you guessed, I was trying to wrangle with rST syntax.

True, I'll stick with the term-first approach, and get rid of the
inconsistency.

(The difference is the -IBRS models have 'spec-ctrl' CPU flag baked in.)

And yes, I like the latter approach =E2=80=94 explicitly spelling it out re=
duces
cogntive load for the readers.

Agree, will fix.  Thanks for the eagle eyes, as usual. :-)
