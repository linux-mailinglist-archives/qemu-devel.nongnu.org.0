Is the plan to wait until NBD_CMF_FLAG_FAST_ZERO gets into the NBD
protocol doc before doing the rest?  Also I would like to release both
libnbd 1.0 and nbdkit 1.14 before we introduce any large new features.
Both should be released this week, in fact maybe even today or
tomorrow.

I can't help thinking that a sh plugin might have been simpler ...

Yes it seems reasonable.

The only thought I had is whether the qemu block layer does or should
combine requests in flight so that a write-zero (offset) followed by a
write-data (same offset) would erase the earlier request.  In some
circumstances that might provide a performance improvement without
needing any changes to protocols.

Yes, I really think we should do this one as well.
