Yeah, that's the problem, well one of the problems in addition to the
lower performance and increased overhead, is that it's a rather poor
emulation of INTx.  It matches pci_irq_pulse(), which has been
discouraged from use.  Anything but kernel irqchip makes me nervous for
INTx, but emulating it with a different physical IRQ type definitely
more so.

Interrupt remapping is really only necessary with high vCPU counts or
maybe nested device assignment, seems doubtful that has a larger user
base.  I did re-watch the video of Steve Rutherford's talk from a
couple years ago, but he does re-iterate that pulling the ioapic from
KVM does have drawbacks for general purpose VMs that I thought would
have precluded it from becoming the default for the base QEMU machine
type.  Getting a GeForce card to run with MSI requires (repeated)
regedit'ing on Windows or module options on Linux.  The audio device
can require the same, otherwise we're probably mostly looking at old
devices assigned for compatibility using INTx, NICs or USB devices
would of course more likely use MSI/X for anything reasonably modern.
Thanks,

Alex
