Yes, as noted on https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/wiki/SubprojectPegasos2 
the GT64120 seems to be an older (and MIPS specific) version of this chip 
that Marvell bought and likely made this PPC version based on that. (The 
whole pegasos2 seems to be like a MIPS board with a PPC CPU even down to 
the firmware which looks quite like PMON just has SmartFirmware instead of 
the commands of PMON. So whoever designed it, might have taken inspiration 
from some MIPS hardware.) However the emulation of GT64xxx in QEMU seemed 
to be not complete and different enough so I haven't looked at that when 
implementing this so I don't know how much commonality is there and if 
that would worth reusing. (If you think there could be some reuse then 
that should be done separate of this series, afterwards it's merged.)
