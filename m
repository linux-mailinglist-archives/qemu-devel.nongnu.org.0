Correct.  We used to have basically the same model for POWER - the
guest just talks to the ultravisor to enter secure mode.  But we
realized that model is broken.  You're effectively advertising
availability of a guest hardware feature based on host kernel or
hardware properties.  That means if you try to migrate from a host
with the facility to one without, you won't know there's a problem
until too late.
