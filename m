I guess I'm wondering what the threat we're protecting against is,
and / or which pieces of the stack we can trust ?

eg, if the host has 2 VMs running, we verify the 1st and provide
its confidental data back to the host, what stops the host giving
that dat to the 2nd non-verified VM ? 

Presumably the data has to be encrypted with a key that is uniquely
tied to this specific boot attempt of the verified VM, and not
accessible to any other VM, or to future boots of this VM ?

Yep, again I'm wondering what the specific threats are that we're
trying to mitigate. Whether we trust the cloud mgmt APIs, but don't
trust the compute hosts, or whether we trust neither the cloud
mgmt APIs or the compute hosts.

If we don't trust the compute hosts, does that include the part
of the cloud mgmt API that is  running on the compute host, or
does that just mean the execution environment of the VM, or something
else?

Yep, I don't think (f) & (g) belong in libvirt, since libvirt is
deployed per compute host, while (f) / (g) are something that is
likely to be deployed in a separate trusted host, at least for
data center / cloud deployments. May be there's a case where they
can all be same-host for more specialized use cases.

Daniel
