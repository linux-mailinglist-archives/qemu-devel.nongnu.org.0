FWIW the older machines have a lot of calls to qdev_create(NULL, TYPE_FOO) for
devices that are part of the machine because they live within the machine address
space but are not specifically attached to a qbus.

Correct. In a perfect world I'd love to say that Daniel's suggestion to use QOM paths
would work, however from my experience they change far too much. This is one of the
reasons that the TYPE_FW_PATH_PROVIDER interface exists so that the generation of
(boot) paths for the firmware is separate from the QOM/qdev paths.

I don't feel too strongly whether it's a link property, some kind of alias, or
perhaps like OpenFirmware just a string property containing the QOM path to the
device, since ultimately I imagine there would be wrapper functions for machine
init() to call which hide away the implementation details.


ATB,

Mark.
