This is now a minimal set of patches needed to make it possible to
experiment with a firmware ROM from real hardware. After finding out
that the board firmware does not probe PCI devices but expects them at
known fixed addresses we only need to change the address of the macio
device to get the firmware correctly map it. This allows dropping
workarounds in previous versions for this and now only the minimal set
of patches are included to get the firmware loaded and do something.
(Also excluded the grackle revision and machine ID pathes for now that
may be needed as the firmware accesses these but seems to go further
without them so until we hit a problem we can live without it,
although I wonder if this causes us unnecessary debugging later so
unless they cause regressions they could be merged).

I still don't get video output but at least it talks to the GPU chip
now so it can be debugged and improved (this will either need
emulating the correct chip the firmware has a driver for or an OF
compliant ROM for the emulated card).

As before the I2C part (patches 6-8) is RFC and unfinished but the
first 5 patches should be good enough now. I hope someone can take
care of I2C, I can look at the ati-vga side later.

Regards,
BALATON Zoltan
