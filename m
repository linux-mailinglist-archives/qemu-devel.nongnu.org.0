Linux 5.3 has made 0.0.0.0/8 a working IPv4 subnet.  As such, "42" is
now a valid host, and the connection to it will (hopefully) time out
over a long period rather than quickly return with EINVAL.

So let us use a negative integer for testing that NBD will not crash
when it receives integer hosts.  This way, the connection will again
fail quickly and reliably.
