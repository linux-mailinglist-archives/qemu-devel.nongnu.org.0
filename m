As you correctly point out, this code needs to be looked at more
carefully so that
if the device does disconnect in the background we can handle the migration=
 path
gracefully. In particular, we need to decide whether a migration
should be allowed
to continue if a device disconnects durning the migration stage.

mst, any thoughts?

Have you looked at the suggestion I gave Li Feng to move vhost_dev_cleanup(=
)
into the connection path in vhost-user-blk? I=E2=80=99m not sure if he=E2=
=80=99s
actively working on it,
but I would prefer if we can find a way to keep some state around
between reconnects
so we aren=E2=80=99t constantly checking dev->started. A device can be stop=
ped
for reasons
other than backend disconnect so I=E2=80=99d rather not reuse this field to
check for backend
disconnect failures.

A couple points here


(1) This will fail the live migration if the device is disconnected.
That my be the right thing
      to do, but if there are cases where migrations can proceed with
a disconnected device,
      this may not be desirable.

(2) This looks racy. As far as I can tell vhost_dev_set_log() is only
called by vhost_migration_log(),
      and as you say one of the first things vhost_migration_log does
is return if dev->started is not
      set. What=E2=80=99s to stop a disconnect from clearing the vdev right
after this check, just before
      vhost_dev_set_features() is called?

As stated above, I would prefer it if we could add some state which
would persist between
reconnects which could then be checked in the vhost-user code before
interacting with
the backend. I understand this will be a much more involved change and
will require a lot
of thought.

Also, regarding (1) above, if the original check in
vhost_migration_log() returns success if the
device is not started why return an error here? I imagine this could
lead to some inconsistent
behavior if the device disconnects before the first check verses
before the second.
