Yes, linux-headers/linux/mman.h has defined MAP_SYNC and 
MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE.

1) If '#include <linux/mman.h>' first then '#include qemu/osdep.h', it 
should be fine.

2) Peter mentioned osdep.h should go first.

It will  cause redefinitions of other MAP_* macros after '#include 
<linux/mman.h>'.

This is where the conflict lies.

Any comments ?
