So in libvirt's case, as long as libvirt manages bitmaps completely,=20
it's a bug in libvirt to request deletion of a bitmap that doesn't=20
exist.  Or, someone messes with a qcow2 image of an offline guest behind=20
libvirt's back without updating libvirt's metadata of what bitmaps=20
should exist, and then if libvirt fails to check that a bitmap actually=20
exists, a user may be able to coerce libvirt into requesting a bitmap=20
deletion that will cause a qemu crash, but that's the user's fault for=20
going behind libvirt's back.  Or, libvirt could add code that instead of=20
trying to blindly delete a bitmap, it first makes a QMP call to ensure=20
the bitmap still exists (annoying, but harmless even when the bug is=20
fixed), instead of blaming the bug on the user operating behind=20
libvirt's back.

The bug is nasty, but feels to be enough of a corner case that I think=20
deferring to 5.0 with CC: stable (and then downstreams can backport it=20
at will) is the right approach; no need to hold up 4.2 if this is the=20
only flaw.  But I'm also not opposed to it going in 4.2 if we have=20
anything else serious.
