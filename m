First search hit.  Here's my second one:

    Q: What are latent bugs?

    A: These bugs do not cause problems today. However, they are lurking
    just waiting to reveal themselves later.  The Ariane 5 rocket
    failure was caused by a float->int conversion error that lay dormant
    when previous rockets were slower; but the faster Ariane 5 triggered
    the problem.  The Millennium bug is another example of a latent bug
    that came to light when circumstances changed.  Latent bugs are much
    harder to test using conventional testing techniques, and finding
    them requires someone with foresight to ask.

My point is: common usage of the term is not as clear-cut as your quote
makes it seem.

get_val() is silent on how it wants to be used.  error.h is anything
but: it spells out how it wantes to be used in quite some detail.  In
particular:

 * Receive an error and pass it on to the caller:
 *     Error *err =3D NULL;
 *     foo(arg, &err);
 *     if (err) {
 *         handle the error...
 *         error_propagate(errp, err);
 *     }
 * where Error **errp is a parameter, by convention the last one.
 *
 * Do *not* "optimize" this to
 *     foo(arg, errp);
 *     if (*errp) { // WRONG!
 *         handle the error...
 *     }
 * because errp may be NULL!

My patch fixes this exact misuse of the interface.

Yes, a bug that can bite deserves a reproducer and a formal Fixes: tag.

The thing we're discussing (however we may want to call it) does not
have a reproducer, and I think we're in agreement that it doesn't need a
Fixes: tag.

However, my patch is not cleaning up something that's dirty, it's fixing
something that's unequivocally wrong: a violation of a stated interface
contract.

The violation happens to have no ill effects at this time due to the way
the violating code is being used.

I call that a "latent bug".  git-log has quite a few occurences of
"latent bug", by Richard Henderson, Daniel Berrang=C3=A9, Paolo, ...

Your point that the commit message should not confuse people looking for
real bugs is well taken.  I think "latent bug" is clear enough, and also
concise.  I'm of course open to better phrasings.

   s390x: Fix currently harmless query-cpu-model-FOO error API violations

feels no clearer to me than

   s390x: Fix latent query-cpu-model-FOO error handling bugs

It's also too long.

I tried.  Your turn :)
