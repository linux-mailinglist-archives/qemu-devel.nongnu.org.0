As Peter has already explained this has to do with *generating* ppc output for
the host, and nothing to do with little vs big endian.

There is only one place from which this ought to be reachable: an extremely
large backward branch, explicitly generated within your tcg ops.

Out of range forward branches are handled gracefully, as they generally occur
due to an internal branch to out-of-line code to handle the slow path of a
memory operation.  Generally this will be "fixed" by restarting generation of
the TB with fewer guest instructions.  E.g.


	insn1
	  memory op, conditional branch to m1
 i2:
	insn2
	insn3
	insn4
	branch to next tb with insn5
 m1:
	slow path for insn1
	goto i2

can be split into

	insn1
	  memory op, conditional branch to m1
  i2:
	insn2
	branch to next tb with insn3
  m1:
	slow path for insn1
	goto i2


However, these forward branches are implicit, part of the expansion of the
INDEX_op_qemu_ld/st tcg opcodes.

Backward branches are are *only* generated by explicit tcg ops, generated by
your target/ code.  Since you should not be generating backward branches
*between* insns, there is no expectation that splitting the TB in half will
have any effect.

I can only suggest that there is some insn for which you are generating inline
code which includes a loop.  This insn should probably be implemented with an
out-of-line helper instead.  But since I have no visibility into the actual
architecture being emulated, I cannot be sure.
