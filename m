Hi Stefan,
Do you have some ideas about how to do this centrally?
There were at least two attempts to do this in a centralized way, but it
seems there is some worry that edge cases will break. However, I'm
not sure there were any concrete examples of such breakages.

(AFAIK Neither handles the BH->DMA->MMIO case, at the moment)
