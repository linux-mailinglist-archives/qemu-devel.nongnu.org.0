Experimented a bit with it again. There's a pause when switching from
the bios to the kernel (after the load reset normal has been done, I
guess), which is always there, but seems to get more noticeable with
this patch (varying wildly, but seems longer on average.) Hard to pin
down, and I don't really see a reason why that should happen, as we
should end up with halted == 1 in any case. Might still be a fluke,
even though I see it both on my laptop and on an LPAR (when running
under tcg; not seen under kvm, which is much faster anyway.)

I'm also looking a bit at the other s390 folks :)
