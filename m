It's also simple to create a mirror, for example to serve machines
without direct internet connection.

How much of the crosscert creation process is (or can can be) automated?

Is it an option to update the certificates much more frequently?  Say
generate them every three days, be valid for 7 days (instead of 90)?
Then just don't run a OCSP service?

take care,
