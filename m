Yes, you can consider bdrv_co_invalidate_cache/bdrv_co_inactivate a pair
of functions to activate/inactivate images. I think all of their callers
are related to migration currently, but it shouldn't make a difference
for you.

The name .bdrv_co_invalidate_cache hints at what usually needs to be
done on migration completion: Any previously read (meta)data must be
invalidated because the migration source (or more genereally: a second
process where the image was activated) may still have written to the
image.
