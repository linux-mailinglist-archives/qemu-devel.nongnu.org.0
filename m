Title:
  QEMU video freezes with "Guest disabled display" (virtio driver)

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I am using Arch Linux as my Guest and Host OS, after starting qemu
  with the following command:

    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda arch-zoom.qcow2 -m 4G -vga
  virtio

  and waiting for a screen blank, I get this message:

    Guest disabled display

  And nothing happens after that, I can move the mouse or hit any key,
  and the message is still there.

  I can still reboot the VM but that's not optimal.

  I can reproduce this with the latest QEMU release (5.0.0) or git master, =

  I also tried this with older releases (4.0.0, 3.0.0) and the issue is sti=
ll there.

  I can't reproduce this with other video drivers (std, qxl).

  With std/qxl the screen will blank a bit and then continue as normal.
