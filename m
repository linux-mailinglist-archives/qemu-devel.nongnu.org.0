Ping? There is another very good reason that we need to keep
--disable-pie for a while. Many users build statically linked qemu user
mode binaries. -static-pie requires newer toolchain:

* GCC 8 or clang 9
* binutils>=2.29
* glibc>=2.27 or musl

Dropping support for GCC<8 does not sound a good idea in the year of 2019. (It may be in a few years.)
