I should have checked the APIs here.

timer_new() allocates memory and initialises a timer.
timer_del() removes a timer from any list it is on, but
does not deallocate memory. It's the function you call
to stop a timer (and arguably timer_stop() would be a
better name for it).
If you created the timer with timer_init(), then the
code to clean it up is:
 (1) call timer_del() to make sure it's not on any
list of active timers
 (2) call timer_free()

So:
 * the mos6522_reset code is fine as it is
 * if we wanted cleanup code that undoes the timer_new
   then that would be a timer_del() + timer_free().
   This would go in unrealize if the timer_new is put
   in realize, but...
 * ...like the other devices touched in this patch,
   mos6522 isn't user-creatable, so if realize succeeds
   it won't ever be destroyed; so we don't need to
   do that. (This is a little harder to check than
   with most of these devices, since mos6522 is an
   abstract base class for some other devices, but
   I think it's correct.)

Side notes:
 * for new code, rather than using timer_new() or one
   of its sibling functions, prefer timer_init(),
   timer_init_ns(), etc. These take a pointer to a
   pre-existing QEMUTimer, typically one you have
   directly embedded in the device state struct. So
   they don't need to be freed on unrealize (though
   you do still want to make sure the timer is not
   on an active list with timer_del() before the memory
   in the device state struct goes away).
 * maybe timer_free() should call timer_del(),
   rather than obliging the caller to?

thanks
