I think I haven't shared any numbers about ACPI.

I don't have details about where exactly the time is spent, but
compiling a guest kernel without ACPI decreases the average boot time in
~12ms, and the kernel's unstripped ELF binary size goes down in a
whooping ~300KiB.

On the other hand, removing ACPI from QEMU decreases its initialization
time in ~5ms, and the binary size is ~183KiB smaller.

IMHO, those are pretty relevant savings on both fronts.
