Yes indeed, the report utilizes Callgrind in the measurements so the
results are very stable.

That's a very nice suggestion. Maybe this will be the idea of a whole
new report. I'll try to execute the provided command and will let you
know if I have any questions.

Future reports will introduce a variety of benchmarks. This report -
and the previous one - are introductory reports. The benchmark used
was to only demonstrate the report ideas. It was not used as a strict
benchmarking program.
