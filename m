We hit the problem in RISC-V now that including a firmware by default
will break all existing users as they are already passing the firmware
in via -kernel.

I don't suppose any other architecture ever had this problem and has a
nice fix? At the moment the only fix I can think of is only include
the default firmware if the user specifies "-bios default". Then
hopefully once everyone is doing that we can make it the default and
not break anything. I can't see a sane way to automatically extract
the information from the kernel binary to be smart about the default.
