The original size back in 2005 was 9000:

[greg@bahia kernel-linus]$ git show 9e82cf6a802a7 | grep 9000
+	v9ses->maxdata =3D 9000;
+	if (v9ses->maxdata !=3D 9000)

which was later converted to 8192.

I couldn't find any hint on why such a small size was chosen.

Maybe you can try to contact 9pfs father ?

I tend to agree. Until linux decides of a better default, we should only
warn the user if they decide to go below the current one.
