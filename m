It is, partially. A CFI check, however, is done at the moment you call 
the function pointer. So if you cast a function pointer to a different 
type (say gboolean (*)(void *) ), but cast it back to the original type 
before you call it, it's going to be fine.

Chances are you are doing this anyway, since you really want to pass 
those parameters to the callback.

I think GLib's approach is clean and shouldn't be an issue with CFI. We 
are indeed passing the function with a wonky cast, but when the callback 
needs to be called back, that part is handled by a dispatcher function 
that we're writing in QEMU code, such as (io/channel-buffer.c:177)

static gboolean
qio_channel_buffer_source_dispatch(GSource *source,
                                    GSourceFunc callback,
                                    gpointer user_data)
{
     QIOChannelFunc func = (QIOChannelFunc)callback;
     QIOChannelBufferSource *bsource = (QIOChannelBufferSource *)source;

     return (*func)(QIO_CHANNEL(bsource->bioc),
                    ((G_IO_IN | G_IO_OUT) & bsource->condition),
                    user_data);
}

So the callback pointer is cast back to the original type, and CFI 
checks should be happy about it.
