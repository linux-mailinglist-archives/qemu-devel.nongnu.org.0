The answer is "probably".

I didn't want to have to redesign the kernel ABI again if the
architecture busts this limit in future.

64 bits already goes beyond what the SVE architecture supports today.

But it would be preferable for QEMUs interface to have the same
arbitrary limit as the kernel, rather than a different arbitrary limit.

Depends how painful it is to support, I guess.
