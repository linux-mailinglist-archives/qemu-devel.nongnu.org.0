Sadly I can't see how to credibly release copyright while remaining
anonymous. In terms of someone submitting it on your behalf, that
depends on the person's willingly to add their own Signed-off-by.
This could be viable for changes which can be considered trivial,
and thus effectively uncopyrightable, but I don't think that applies
here. An alternative would be if some other contributor knows you
well enough to be confident in adding their SoB.

If not, I'll keep this RFE on my list of TODO items to write a
new patch myself.

With regards,
Daniel
