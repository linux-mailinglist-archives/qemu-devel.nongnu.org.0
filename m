Note that modifying a currently active keyslot is potentially dangerous
operation and thus not allowed at all by default unless user passes 'force'
parameter.

The right safe usage is always to add a new keyslot and then erase the old
one(s).

Exactly. The keyslot is scattered on the disk. It partially resides
in 1st 512 bytes sector as part of 8 keyslot header table,
and partially resides in area after that header, where the encrypted
master key is stored. Due to anti-forensic algorithm used, that
area for each keyslot even takes itself several sectors.

Write can fail partially/fully and leave us with broken keyslot.
In theory you can restore the old values, but since write failure
usually means media error (e.g. bad disk sector), this won't help much.
In theory the code can try to write a other keyslot, but that is even uglie=
r.

Its best to leave this to user and thus user indeed is supposed to write fi=
rst to a free keyslot,
check that write succeeded and only then erase the old keyslot.

This can be dangerous too if last keyslot is erased since that basically
guarantees data loss, and therefore also needs 'force' option in my patchse=
t.

^^ and the above is especially bad if erasing last keyslot as explained abo=

Note that my code doesn't support this currently, and user can do this
by first adding a secret and then erasing old one.
I can add this just for fun (but only when 'force' is used).

OK.

No problem with that.

I am not sure I like the 'zap' action, but if this is agreed upon,
I won't argue about this.
