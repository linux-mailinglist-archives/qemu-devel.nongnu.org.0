Conor,

Thanks for the Icicle-kit walk-through! I'll not claim that I fully understood it,
but I understood enough to handle the situation ATM.

Without this change, this is where the FDT is being installed in the board when
I start it with 8Gb of RAM (retrieved via 'info roms'):

addr=00000000bfe00000 size=0x00a720 mem=ram name="fdt"

Which surprised me at first because this is almost at the end of the LO area which has
1Gb and I figured it would be in the middle of another RAM area. I took another read
at what we're doing in riscv_load_fdt():

-----------
temp = (dram_base < 3072 * MiB) ?  MIN(dram_end, 3072 * MiB) : dram_end;
fdt_addr = QEMU_ALIGN_DOWN(temp - fdtsize, 2 * MiB);
-----------

This code can be read as "if the starting address of the RAM is lower than 3Gb, put
the FDT no further than 3Gb (0xc0000000). Otherwise, put it at the end of dram",
where "dram_base" is the starting address of the RAM block that the function
receives.

For icicle-kit, this is being passed as  memmap[MICROCHIP_PFSOC_DRAM_LO].base,
0x80000000, which is 2Gb.

So, regardless of how much RAM we have (dram_end), the FDT will always be capped at
3Gb. At this moment, this fits exactly at the end of the LO area for the Icicle Kit.
Which is funny because this 3Gb restriction was added by commit 1a475d39ef54 to fix
32 bit guest boot and it happened to also work for the Microchip SoC.

So yeah, I thought that I was fixing a bug and in the end I caused one. This patch
needs to go.


Alistair, I believe I should re-send v2, this time explaining why the existing function
will not break the Microchip board because we'll never put the FDT out of the LO area
of the board. Does this work for you?


Conor, one more thing:

I tried it out with kernel v6.0.0 (I saw you mentioning in the other thread that
this was the latest kernel you were able to boot this way)  and it booted up until
the kernel complained about missing initramfs. Any tips on how I can build an
initrd disk for the board?


Thanks,


Daniel
