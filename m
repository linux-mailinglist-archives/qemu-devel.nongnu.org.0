Hi,

This series is mainly a fix for
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1703793.  The problem
described there is that mirroring to a gluster volume, then switching
off the volume makes qemu crash.  There are two problems here:

(1) file-posix reopens the FD all the time because it thinks the FD it
    has is RDONLY.  It actually isn=E2=80=99t after the first reopen, we =
just
    forgot to change the internal flags.  That=E2=80=99s what patch 1 is =
for.

(2) Even then, when mirror completes, it drops its write permission on
    the FD.  This requires a reopen, which will fail if the volume is
    down.  Mirror doesn=E2=80=99t expect that.  Nobody ever expects that
    dropping permissions can fail, and rightfully so because that=E2=80=99=
s what
    I think we have generally agreed on.
    Therefore, the block layer should hide this error.  This is what the
    last two patches are for.

The last patch adds two assertions: bdrv_replace_child() (for the old
BDS) and bdrv_inactivate_recurse() assume they only ever drop
assertions.  This is now substantiated by these new assertions.
It turns out that this assumption was just plain wrong.  Patches 3 to 5
make it right.


v2:
- Patch 1: Set s->perm_change_flags for reopen, too [Kevin]
- Patch 6:
  - Rename loosen_restrictions to tighten_restrictions and kind of
    invert its meaning [Kevin]
  - Assert and document that we cannot return useful information about
    whether restrictions are loosened or tightened if the caller wants
    to reopen the node [Kevin]
- Patch 7: Handle loosen_restrictions -> tighten_restrictions fallout
