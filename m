I'd really like to figure out a way to be able to partially run
this test. When I have hit problems in the past, I needed to
run specific tests, but then the expected output always contains
everything.  I've thought of a few options

 - Split it into many stanadlone tests - eg
     tests/qemu-iotests/tests/luks-host-$ALG

 - Split only the expected output eg
 
     149-$SUBTEST

  and have a way to indicate which of expected output files
  we need to concatenate for the set of subtests that we
  run.

 - Introduce some template syntax in expected output
   tha can be used to munge the output.

 - Stop comparing expected output entirely and just
   then this into a normal python unit test.

 - Insert your idea here ?
