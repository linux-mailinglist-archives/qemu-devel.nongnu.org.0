Right, if we followed the spec, disable-modern would have been
force-legacy.

I'm fine with adding force-legacy for everyone and asking tools to
transition if there. Document it's same as disable-modern for pci.

Reduce security attack surface slightly. Save some cycles
(down the road) on branches in the endian-ness handling.
Make sure your guests
are all up to date in preparation to the day when legacy will go away.

Not a huge win, for sure, but hey - it's something.
