Okay, I can reproduce: with -m 256,128G, /machine has 549 children, of
which 511 are spapr-drc-lmb.

Thomas reported device-introspect-test -m slow has become much slower
for ppc64.  Bisection traced it to my commit e8c9e65816 "qom: Make "info
qom-tree" show children sorted".  Uses default memory size, no
spapr-drc-lmb as far as I remember.
