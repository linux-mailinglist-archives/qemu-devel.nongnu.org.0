Hi,

Could you try the qemu=E2=80=99s master branch?
bfb23b480a49114315877aacf700b49453e0f9d9 has fixed an issue that sounds
very much like this.  The problem in that case is that libcurl 7.59.0
changed behavior, so bisecting qemu will not produce results.

Title:
  qemu-img check failing on remote image in Eoan

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed
Status in qemu package in Ubuntu:
  New

Bug description:
  The "qemu-img check" function is failing on remote (HTTP-hosted)
  images, beginning with Ubuntu 19.10 (qemu-utils version 1:4.0+dfsg-
  0ubuntu9). With previous versions, through Ubuntu 19.04/qemu-utils
  version 1:3.1+dfsg-2ubuntu3.5, the following worked:

  $ /usr/bin/qemu-img check  http://10.193.37.117/cloud/eoan-server-cloudim=
g-amd64.img
  No errors were found on the image.
  19778/36032 =3D 54.89% allocated, 90.34% fragmented, 89.90% compressed cl=
usters
  Image end offset: 514064384

  The 10.193.37.117 server holds an Apache server that hosts the cloud
  images on a LAN. Beginning with Ubuntu 19.10/qemu-utils 1:4.0+dfsg-
  0ubuntu9, the same command never returns. (I've left it for up to an
  hour with no change.) I'm able to wget the image from the same server
  and installation on which qemu-img check fails. I've tried several
  .img files on the server, ranging from Bionic to Eoan, with the same
  results with all of them.
