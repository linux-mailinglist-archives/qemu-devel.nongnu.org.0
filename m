I haven't read the scsi code, but as written, I would assume that any 
portion of the block status with this result has the following properties:
- reading sees guest-visible data; we cannot guarantee whether it is all 
zero, and the data reserves actual space

> anchored: BDRV_BLOCK_DATA | BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO | BDRV_BLOCK_OFFSET_VALID

- reading sees all zeros, but the disk has reserved actual space such 
that future writes will not run out of space

> deallocated: !BDRV_BLOCK_DATA

- reading does not see data; future writes will have to reserve space. 
I would expect this option might also have '| BDRV_BLOCK_ZERO' depending 
on whether this particular scsi device guarantees that reads of an 
unallocated portion see all zeros instead of unspecified garbage.

Adding Vladimir in CC as well, as he has pending patches that try to 
clear up the use of BDRV_BLOCK_* constants with regards to two different 
queries:
- allocation implies that data comes from this layer of a backing chain, 
rather than deferring to a backing image
- allocation implies that storage is reserved (that is, not sparse)

It sounds like we are trying to represent the second question for scsi 
(namely, the same question that gets answered by lseek(SEEK_HOLE) for 
POSIX files), and not the first (namely, the question answered for qcow2 
images).
