IMHO, the flag just sounds wrong for images created by Qemu, and sounds OK
for images provided by user (still, it can never be safe, as user may mista=
ke).

Still, as I understand, in most of real cases, Qemu actually can determine
is-zero by itself, we just didn't have this coded (Eric's series does). And
may be we really don't need this arguable flag..

So, really, may be rename it to --skip-zeroes, to make obvious that it is u=
nsafe
and user is responsible for the result? Or even to --x-skip-zeroes, and dro=
p it
when all needed cases are covered by auto detection?

--=20
