Thanks, this helps a lot! We will now check the code again and see what
causes the behaviour.

Title:
  qemu 4.2.0 arm  segmentation fault with gcc 9.2

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  As discussed with f4bug yesterday on IRC here comes the bug
  description.

  I'm building/configured qemu-4.2.0 on an x86_64 (gcc (Debian
  6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516) with target-list "arm-softmmu,arm-
  linux-user" and debug enabled. I use the arm-linux-user variant,
  "qemu-arm".

  Then i'm trying to cross-compile (arm gcc) an old version of googles
  v8 (as i need this version of the lib for binary compatibility) which
  uses qemu during build.

  It worked with gcc 5.4.0 but not with 9.2.0. I also tried with 6.5.0,
  7.4.0 and 8.3.0 but those are also causing the same segmentation
  fault.

  The executed command wich breaks qemu is:

   qemu-arm /tmp/build/out/arm.release/mksnapshot.arm --log-snapshot-
  positions --logfile
  /tmp/build/out/arm.release/obj.host/v8_snapshot/geni/snapshot.log
  --random-seed 314159265 /tmp/build/out/arm.release/obj.host/v8_snap

  The printed error message is:

  ARMv7=3D1 VFP3=3D1 VFP32DREGS=3D1 NEON=3D0 SUDIV=3D0 UNALIGNED_ACCESSES=
=3D1 MOVW_MOVT_IMMEDIATE_LOADS=3D0 USE_EABI_HARDFLOAT=3D1
  qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped

  Calling qemu with gdb gives the following information:

   Thread 1 "qemu-arm" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
   0x0000555555d63d11 in static_code_gen_buffer ()

  and

   (gdb) bt

  Calling qemu-arm with debug switch "-d in_asm,int,op_opt" shows the
  log in the attached file.

  Thanks for any hints!
  Fabian
