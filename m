Thanks for explaining this.

I have changed the CC list a bit to be a little more targeted.

Agreed. I don't think anyone has been saying that these changes should
be for QEMU only. All of the changes talked about apply to both the
QEMU model and the hardware.

That is a noble goal, but doesn't HSS currently pull in the OpenSBI
library, so it's doing more than just dealing with silicon bugs. As
well as that HSS is not supported by distros, so distros can't build
or ship it. For example OE won't build it in the meta-riscv layer,
meaning that the Icle board just isn't supported. This means the board
misses out on core work, for example it won't be able to utilise the
RISC-V AGL work that has started.

Also, how are users expected to update HSS as bugs and vulnerabilities
are found if it isn't shipped by distros?

Again, this is just awesome!

If we could change it to be more like a traditional ROM in terms of
features then that would be really helpful. In that case we wouldn't
need it for QEMU and only use it for hardware. It would only handle
basic hardware boot up and then hand it over to U-Boot SPL/OpenSBI.

I understand what you mean. In saying that it is usually easiest to
start with the goal of upstreaming and then work towards that. That
way all of the architectures decisions are made in that context. Maybe
at first you have a fork while everything is in flux, but then it's
really helpful to have the work upstreamed.

I think we have all seen too many "open source" projects that just
fork everything, dump their code and never contribute back.
Unfortunately when that happens we end up with duplicate work and
frustrated engineers. As well as that the original project misses out
on all the advantages of open source as they aren't benefiting from
others work as well.

The open source focus is great to hear. I think we are all really glad
that MicroChip is doing this. It's a great first step, but it doesn't
end there.
