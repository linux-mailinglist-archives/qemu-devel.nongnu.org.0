Side comment:

Ard and Alex extracted TCG to run x86 PCIe UEFI option ROMs on aarch64
hardware.

https://github.com/ardbiesheuvel/X86EmulatorPkg
https://kvmforum2017.sched.com/event/Bo0S/qemu-in-uefi-alexander-graf-suse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DuxvAH1Q4Mx0

If I remember correctly, they specifically picked a git commit hash that
was still purely BSD licensed.

FWIW,
<https://github.com/ardbiesheuvel/X86EmulatorPkg/blob/master/LICENSE> is
not any BSD license, so I'm almost surely out of date on that aspect;
just wanted to confirm that TCG has been usefully extracted.

Thanks,
Laszlo
