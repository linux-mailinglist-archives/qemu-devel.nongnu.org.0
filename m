Well, we have netdev's and NICs that connect them to the guest,
        and blockdev's and guest devices that expose them to the guest

My worry here is that this is all being done behind the back of the
management tools in this series.
The management tools already deal with hot-unplugging and problems with
it;  here we're duplicating that set of problems and trying to stuff
them into the start of migration.

Yep, tricky.
