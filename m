It sounds like you already have a v2 coming up to address Phillipe's=20
comments, but I'd be happy to see this concept make it into v5.0.

Why fork out to 'pwd', when we can rely on $PWD for the same answer?=20
Note that both $(pwd) and $PWD $BUILDDIR always give an absolute (but no=20
necessarily canonical) path, which means...

...calling this ABS_BUILDDIR is a misnomer (it was already absolute).=20
What it is really doing is chasing through symlinks to result in a=20
canonical name, particularly since unless you have absolute names, using=20
only string comparison to see if two filenames are equivalent will have=20
false negatives (/tmp vs. /tmp/., for example).

> +ABS_SRCDIR=3D$(realpath $SRCDIR)

Not robust if there are spaces in the directory names.  Safer would be
ABS_BUILDDIR=3D$(realpath -- "$BUILDDIR")
and similarly for ABS_SRCDIR.

Bashism. You MUST spell this '=3D', not '=3D=3D', since configure is run un=
der=20
/bin/sh which might be dash which does not understand =3D=3D.

You know, it WOULD be possible to further enhance this to actually=20
create 'build' as well as a shim GNUmakefile that would auto-forward on=20
to building directly in build, so that you maintain the illusion of an=20
in-place build (other than all the build artifacts now living in a=20
different location), and muscle memory for in-tree 'make' still works;=20
I've posted elsewhere and will repeat here the contents of my GNUmakefile:

# Hack for redirecting while reminding myself to use distinct builddir
ifeq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),)
recurse: all
endif
%: force
=09@echo 'changing directory to build...'
=09@sleep 2
=09@$(MAKE) -C build -f Makefile $(MAKECMDGOALS)
force: ;
.PHONY: force
GNUmakefile: ;


But we could do that as a patch on top of yours.
