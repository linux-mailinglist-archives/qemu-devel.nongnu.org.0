I don't have a strong opinion on the specifics.  If you believe
that's the best solution, I trust your judgement.

My only point was that we don't always need to add new CPU types
for every conceivable use case, and some (but not all) problems
can be solved by simple new properties.

(To be honest, I'm now having trouble mapping these ideas to real
world problems or use cases.  What are the specific problems
we're trying to solve right now?)
