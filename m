Sure, so your answer to =E2=80=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s the point of supporting -=

And BB-level throttling, fair enough.

(Although the first step would be probably to make throttle groups
non-experimental?  Like, drop the x- prefix for all their parameters.)

Yes, that=E2=80=99s what I meant by =E2=80=9Cenforce on the host that the=
 target is
always flushed before the source=E2=80=9D.  Well, I meant to say there is=

good way of doing that, and I kind of don=E2=80=99t consider this a good =
way.

I don=E2=80=99t know.  =E2=80=9CUse this option so your data isn=E2=80=99=
t lost in case of a
power failure, but it makes everything pretty slow=E2=80=9D?  Who is goin=
