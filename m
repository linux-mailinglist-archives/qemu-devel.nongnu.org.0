Bryce apparently never got around to work on this again, so I'll have
another try now ...

During Google Summer of Code 2011, Bryce Lanham added the possibility to
emulate the NeXTcube machine in QEMU, e.g. see this URL for some details:

https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011#NeXT_machines_system_emulation

But since the machine requires a 68040 CPU and this was not included in
upstream QEMU in 2011 yet, the patches have never been merged to upstream.

Then, during the last years, Laurent completed the full 680x0 support in
upstream QEMU, so we could finally merge the NeXTcube support, too.

The QEMU interfaces changed a lot since 2011, so I had to modify the
sources quite a bit, but with the attached patches, it is now possible
to boot up to the firmware monitor again.

Note that boot device emulation is either still missing (network and SCSI),
so you can not boot any operating systems with this machine yet. I have
the patches for these devices in my brach here:

 https://gitlab.com/huth/qemu/commits/next-cube

... but they are not quite working yet, so I'll submit them later once
they have been fixed and the basic support patches of this series have
been merged.

v2:
 - Don't use memory_region_allocate_system_memory() for the framebuffer
   device anymore
 - Turn the keyboard device into a proper QOM device
 - Put the global variables in the third patch into the machine state
   structure
 - Got rid of the "//" C++ comments
