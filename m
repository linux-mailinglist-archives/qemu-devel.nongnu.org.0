I mean the BlockBackend for which blk_root_drained_poll() is called.

Oh, I see. Then it can't be job BlockBackend, of course.

I can get hangs, but that's for job_completed(), not for starting the
job. Also, my hangs have a non-empty bs->tracked_requests, so it looks
like a different case to me.

In my case, the hanging requests looks like this:

(gdb) qemu coroutine 0x556e055750e0
#0  0x0000556e03999150 in qemu_coroutine_switch (from_=3Dfrom_@entry=3D0x55=

41

Checking the thread pool request:

(gdb) p *((ThreadPool*)0x7fd33c003120).head .lh_first
$9 =3D {common =3D {aiocb_info =3D 0x556e03f43f80 <thread_pool_aiocb_info>,=
 bs =3D 0x0, cb =3D 0x556e0397f670 <thread_pool_co_cb>, opaque =3D 0x7fd2d2=
b96400, refcnt =3D 1}, pool =3D 0x7fd33c003120,
  func =3D 0x556e038d59a0 <handle_aiocb_rw>, arg =3D 0x7fd2d2b96440, state =
=3D THREAD_DONE, ret =3D 0, reqs =3D {tqe_next =3D 0x0, tqe_circ =3D {tql_n=
ext =3D 0x0, tql_prev =3D 0x0}}, all =3D {le_next =3D 0x0,
    le_prev =3D 0x7fd33c0031d0}}

So apparently the request is THREAD_DONE, but the coroutine was never
reentered. I saw one case where ctx.bh_list was empty, but I also have a
case where a BH sits there scheduled and apparently just doesn't get
run:

(gdb) p *((ThreadPool*)0x7fd33c003120).ctx.bh_list .slh_first
$13 =3D {ctx =3D 0x556e04e41a10, cb =3D 0x556e0397f8e0 <thread_pool_complet=
ion_bh>, opaque =3D 0x7fd33c003120, next =3D {sle_next =3D 0x0}, flags =3D =
3}

Stefan, I wonder if this is related to the recent changes to the BH
implementation.

Kevin
