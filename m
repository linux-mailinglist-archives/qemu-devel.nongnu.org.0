Title:
  Getting qemu: uncaught target signal 6 when running  lv2 plugin cross-
  compilation

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  Hey,
  I am part of the Zynthian team and we use qemu-arm-static to cross compil=
e lv2 audio plugins.

  When running a compilation of DISTRHO-Ports we get:

  lv2_ttl_generator: pthread_mutex_lock.c:81: __pthread_mutex_lock: Asserti=
on `mutex->__data.__owner =3D=3D 0' failed.
  qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped
  ./scripts/generate-ttl.sh: line 27: 16524 Aborted                 $GEN ./=
$FILE
  Makefile:62: recipe for target 'gen_lv2' failed
  make[1]: *** [gen_lv2] Error 134
  make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/zynthian-sw/plugins/DISTRHO-Ports'
  Makefile:104: recipe for target 'lv2' failed
  make: *** [lv2] Error 2

  =

  lv2_ttl_generator source is here:
  https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/master/libs/lv2-ttl-generat=
or

  The command that is ruining is
  lv2_ttl_generator ./TAL-Filter-2.so =


  And ./TAL-Filter-2.so source is here:
  https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/master/ports/tal-filter-2/s=
ource


  Is there a way to debug what is going on?
  This runs fine on a Raspberrypi which is armv7

  A workaround would also help.

  Using qemu-arm-static version from master from two days ago:
  qemu-arm version 2.12.50 (v2.12.0-1182-ga7a7309ca5-dirty), commit: a7a730=
9ca52c327c6603d60db90ae4feeae719f7

  Also saw this in qemu-arm version 2.12.0 (Debian 1:2.12+dfsg-3)

  Thanks,
  Guy
