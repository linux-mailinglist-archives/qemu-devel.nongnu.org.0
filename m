Ah yes, I recall vaguelly testing this whilst writing patches for libvirt=
.

Thing is, libvirt creates a mount namespace for domains (one namespace=20
for one domain). In this namespace a dummy /dev is mounted and only=20
nodes that qemu is configured to have are created. For instance, you=20
won't see /dev/sda there unless your domain has it as a disk. Then,=20
libvirt moves pr-helper process into the same cgroups as the qemu's main=20
thread. This is all done so that pr-helper has the same view of the=20
system as qemu. I don't think that he same result can be achieved using=20
socket activation.
Also, libvirt spawns one pr-helper per domain (so that the socket can be=20
private and share seclabel with qemu process it's attached to).
