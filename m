Nobody thinks of qom-set when adding a QOM property.

qom-set runs a setter function that can do anything.  Is that safe at
any point of time?  Depends.

Fortunately, most setters merely write to some object instance variable.

Often, the object's code reads the instance variable only in realize(),
and never writes to it.  qom-set is safe then, but not terribly useful.

More interesting are the ones that are read and written throughout the
object's life cycle.  Is qom-set safe at any point of time?  Depends.

Your belief qom-set can't break a guest in practice is reassuring.

However, the point I was trying to make with "you get to keep the
pieces" is precisely that we're "not making too much of QOM part of the
API".

An additional point I'd like to repeat now: which parts of QOM are is
pretty much anybody's guess.
