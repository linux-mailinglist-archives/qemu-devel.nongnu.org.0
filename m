This makes sense to me...

...however, I'm scratching my head here.

If we have a future guest that knows how to handle this, how do we
know? We know that the current Linux driver clears
VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM during feature negotiation, and presumably a
guest that knows how to handle this will not do that. But it still
won't work as expected, as we inhibit ballooning...

So, either
- we don't inhibit ballooning now; any guest that clears the (required)
  virtio feature bit won't be able to drive the virtio-balloon device
  anyway, but a future guest that negotiates the bit would work; or
- we inhibit ballooning now; no guest can therefore use ballooning,
  regardless what they are doing or not doing (this includes guests
  that negotiate the feature bit, but fail to handle pages properly).

Or is there some other reason why we need to inhibit ballooning for
protected vms?
