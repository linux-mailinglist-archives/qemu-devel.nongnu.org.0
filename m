This should be a straightforward DMA cancel. I added some more traces;

# After the 0x35 command write:
ide_exec_cmd IDE exec cmd: bus 0x561808b0ecc0; state 0x561808b0f118; cmd 0x=
35
ide_sector_start_dma IDEState 0x561808b0f118;
ide_start_dma IDEState 0x561808b0f118;

# After the 0xe1 bmdma kick:
ide_dma_cb_entry IDEState 0x561808b0f118; ret 0;
ide_dma_cb IDEState 0x561808b0f118; sector_num=3D1 n=3D259 cmd=3DDMA WRITE
ide_dma_cb_next IDEState 0x561808b0f118;

So far, pretty normal. IDE calls the HBA's DMA start, but the HBA
doesn't have DMA enabled, so it stalls. Later, when we turn on DMA, the
HBA engages the DMA callback and sets up the first transfer. This sets
s->bus->dma->aiocb.

Then, we try to cancel DMA:

ide_cancel_dma_sync IDEState 0x561808b0f118;
ide_cancel_dma_sync_remaining draining all remaining requests
1343877@1595891049.469050:dma_blk_cb dbs=3D0x55baededdc50 ret=3D0
1343877@1595891049.469054:dma_map_wait dbs=3D0x55baededdc50
qemu-system-i386: /home/jsnow/src/qemu/hw/ide/core.c:732: void ide_cancel_d=
ma_sync(IDEState *): Assertion `s->bus->dma->aiocb =3D=3D NULL' failed.

We still have a DMA callback out, so we try to synchronously cancel it;
but the blk_drain doesn't appear to be effective!

We apparently wind up here:

    if (dbs->iov.size =3D=3D 0) {
        trace_dma_map_wait(dbs);
        dbs->bh =3D aio_bh_new(dbs->ctx, reschedule_dma, dbs);
        cpu_register_map_client(dbs->bh);
        return;
    }


... The DMA simply re-schedules itself (?) when iov.size is zero. unfortuna=
tely for us, that means that the original point of scheduling the drain doe=
sn't work, because the DMA never returns all the way to the IDE device emul=
ation code.

Title:
  qemu-system-x86_64: hw/ide/core.c:685: ide_cancel_dma_sync: Assertion
  `s->bus->dma->aiocb =3D=3D NULL' failed.

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Since upgrading to QEMU 2.8.0, my Windows 7 64-bit virtual machines
  started crashing due to the assertion quoted in the summary failing.
  The assertion in question was added by commit 9972354856 ("block: add
  BDS field to count in-flight requests").  My tests show that setting
  discard=3Dunmap is needed to reproduce the issue.  Speaking of
  reproduction, it is a bit flaky, because I have been unable to come up
  with specific instructions that would allow the issue to be triggered
  outside of my environment, but I do have a semi-sane way of testing that
  appears to depend on a specific initial state of data on the underlying
  storage volume, actions taken within the VM and waiting for about 20
  minutes.

  Here is the shortest QEMU command line that I managed to reproduce the
  bug with:

      qemu-system-x86_64 \
          -machine pc-i440fx-2.7,accel=3Dkvm \
          -m 3072 \
          -drive file=3D/dev/lvm/qemu,format=3Draw,if=3Dide,discard=3Dunmap=
 \
  	-netdev tap,id=3Dhostnet0,ifname=3Dtap0,script=3Dno,downscript=3Dno,vhos=
t=3Don \
          -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet0 \
  	-vnc :0

  The underlying storage (/dev/lvm/qemu) is a thin LVM snapshot.

  QEMU was compiled using:

      ./configure --python=3D/usr/bin/python2.7 --target-list=3Dx86_64-soft=
mmu
      make -j3

  My virtualization environment is not really a critical one and
  reproduction is not that much of a hassle, so if you need me to gather
  further diagnostic information or test patches, I will be happy to help.
