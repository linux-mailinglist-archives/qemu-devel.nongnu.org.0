I assume David's fixes have been released with QEMU v4.2, so I'm closing
this ticket now.

Title:
  qemu TCG in s390x mode issue with calculating HASH

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  When using go on s390x on Debian x64 (buster) (host) and debian s390x
  (sid) (guest) I run into the following problem :

  The following occurs while trying to build a custom project :

  go: github.com/FactomProject/basen@v0.0.0-20150613233007-fe3947df716e:
  Get
  https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/%21factom%21project/basen/@v/v0.0.0-2=
0150613233007-fe3947df716e.mod:
  local error: tls: bad record MAC

  Doing a git bisect I find that this problem only occurs on and after
  commit 08ef92d556c584c7faf594ff3af46df456276e1b

  Before that commit, all works fine. Past this commit, build always
  fails.

  Without any proof, It looks like a hash calculation bug related to
  using z/Arch vector facilities...
