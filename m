Hi all,

I have a question related to the VNC server keyboard settings. Currently =
the user of qemu has to decide before VM startup which language is used =
for VNC keyboard mapping. If no keyboard is configured, the en-us =
keyboard will be loaded for keysym to scancode conversion. A later =
reconfiguration of the keyboard is not possible at present.

So here is my idea:

The VNC Display context stores a list of loaded keyboards (like =
vs->vd->kbds). If no keyboard was specified, at least the default will =
be added to the list ("en-us"?). If a client connects, a copy of the =
(latest configured) pointer will be stored within the VncState =
structure. For any keys sent by this client the own keyboard reference =
will be used.

As (in theory) every VNC client may have a differen keyboard layout, in =
my point of view it makes sense to attach the keyboard used for =
keysym2scancode() to the client context rather to the VNC server =
context. However as (most likely) all clients do have the same keyboard =
mapping it would be an overhead to parse and store the mapping list each =
time the client connects.

Now in my idea two mechanisms may change the behavior of the client =
keyboard.

1.) a qmp command was sent, that sets /configures for a =
particular/default keyboard.
2.) within the VNC protocol a =
"VNC_MSG_CLIENT_QEMU/VNC_MSG_CLIENT_QEMU_EXT_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" message =
arrives

If the new keyboard was not already loaded and stored inside =
vs->vd->kbds , qemu initializes the new mapping. The affected VNC client =
(VncState) again stores the reference only.

This enables switching the keyboard layout during runtime as well as =
using multiple different keyboard layouts at atime.

Together with a corresponding patch I would also add a patch for =
libvncclient to have a reference implmentation for the integrated =
keyboard layout switching.

What are your thoughts about this kind of improvement?

Thanks,
Mario=
