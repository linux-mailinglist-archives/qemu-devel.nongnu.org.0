I agree, right now on s390x "-cpu max" behaves almost like "-cpu=20
qemu"/"-cpu host", but you don't have to care about the accelerator.=20
Removing it might we evil. Removing it is not really an option.

IMHO, max should really include all features (yes, also the bad=20
x-features on arm :) ) and we should have a way to give users the=20
opportunity to specify "just give me the best model independent of the=20
accelerator" - something like a "best" model, but I don't care about the=20
name.

E.g., we could introduce a new model for that purpose and start warning=20
if "-cpu max" is used (and recommend them to use the other model) to run=20
a VM and not simply to query model properties via the qmp interfaces.=20
The users are aware of the model restrictions and can switch.
