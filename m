Use of TAB is an accident.

Pasto, fixing...

Result:

            has_MEMBER    MEMBER
    false         true     false
    true          true      true
    absent       false  false/ignore

As long as the instance is built according to the rules, you can
contract has_MEMBER && MEMBER to just MEMBER.  Both mean "true".

However, has_MEMBER && !MEMBER cannot be contracted to !MEMBER.  The
former means "false", the latter means "false or absent".

Doubters, see the table above.

Putting defaults in the schema would let us eliminate the "absent"
state, the has_MEMBER flags, and the bugs that come with them.  Sadly,
this project has been crowded out by more urgent or important work since
forever.
