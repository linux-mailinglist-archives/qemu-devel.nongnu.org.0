Pierre doesn't mean the Device/Vendor IDs he means it has devfn == 0
so it is the mandatory function zero on it's PCI bus, where until recently
we always had only one function per bus but with the recent multi-function
support it can act more like on other platforms with several PCI functions
sharing the same Bus e.g. a PF and the VFs created through sriov_numvfs.
That's why I'm saying that having devfn == 0 should not be very special for a VF
passed to a VM and I really don't see where it would not act like a VF passed
from any other Hypervisor.

The only really tricky part in my opinion is where during the "probing"
we do set is_virtfn so it happens both for VFs passed-through from z/VM
or LPAR and VFs created through sriov_numvfs which unlike on other platforms
are also scanned by Firmware (pdev->no_vf_scan disables the Linux side scanning).
With the fix I'm currently testing I had to do this in pcibios_enable_device()
because I also create sysfs links between VFs and their parent PFs and those
need the sysfs entries to be already created, which makes the more apropriately
sound pcibios_bus_add_device() too early.
