Errors-To: qemu-devel-bounces+lists+qemu-devel=lfdr.de@nongnu.org

Running the operation under debugger catches this error:
Critical error detected c0000374
(2314.a54): Break instruction exception - code 80000003 (first chance)
ntdll!RtlIsNonEmptyDirectoryReparsePointAllowed+0x72:
00007ffe`0780b2d2 cc              int     3

This error means that a heap corruption was detected. To find the place whe=
re the corruption occured, I've ran qemu under appverifier, which is some k=
ind of ASAN\MSAN for windows.
The tool caught an access violation, the callstack seems to be not full, sa=
ve_snapshot calls qemu_savevm_state_iterate, then a call to ram_save_iterat=
e, then ram_find_and_save_block. But the address of the exception does not =
correspond to this function.
Disassembling qemu and searching for this address, I've found that it proba=
bly corresponds to this snippet in ram_save_host_page:
    do {
        /* Check the pages is dirty and if it is send it */
        if (!migration_bitmap_clear_dirty(rs, pss->block, pss->page)) {
            pss->page++;
            continue;
        }

The missing callstack part is probably ram_find_and_save_block calling ram_=
save_host_page at this place:
        if (found) {
            pages =3D ram_save_host_page(rs, &pss, last_stage);
        }

It seems that the compiler inlined several functions to ram_find_and_save_b=
lock and that is the reason for the partial stack.
Since I am still unable to see local variable values during debugging, I ca=
n't give more info now. =

I think the bug can be found when running qemu on linux with ASAN\MSAN. Whe=
n this does not find the bug, I do more debugging.
I want mention that the caught access violation is due to reading an invali=
d address. The bug found without appverifier is due to writing to an invali=
d address, so there may be several bugs.

Title:
  qemu on windows host exits after savevm command

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I'm running qemu-system-i386.exe 3.1.0 with this command line:
  "C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-i386.exe"  -L C:\user\qemu\pc-bios\ -n=
ame win7 -m 4G -uuid 564db62e-e031-b5cf-5f34-a75f8cefa98e -rtc base=3Dlocal=
time -accel hax -hdd C:\VirtualMachines\Dev\Win10x64_VS17\swap.qcow "C:\Vir=
tualMachines\qemu\qemu_win7.qcow"
  Host OS Windows 10 x64, guest OS Wondows 7 x86.

  Wait till the OS loads, go to compat_monitor0 tab and enter command:
  savevm loaded_win
  After a few seconds qemu exits, running it another time and entering comm=
and:
  info snapshots
  says "There is no snapshot available". I've tried rinning it with -accel =
tcg, with same results. I've tried less memory (1G), same results.
