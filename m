That should work.

1. One alternative is

if (!pfn_valid(pfn))
	return false;
#ifdef CONFIG_ZONE_DEVICE
page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
if (page_zonenum(page) == ZONE_DEVICE)
	return false;
#endif
return true;


Note that when you are dealing with random PFNs, this approach is in 
general not safe; the memmap could be uninitialized and contain garbage. 
You can have false positives for ZONE_DEVICE.


2. Yet another (slower?) variant to detect (some?) ZONE_DEVICE is

pgmap = get_dev_pagemap(pfn, NULL);
put_dev_pagemap(pgmap);

if (pgmap)
	return false;
return true;



I know that /dev/mem mappings can be problematic ... because the memmap 
could be in any state and actually we shouldn't even touch/rely on any 
"struct pages" at all, as we have a pure PFN mapping ...
