I see the points, thanks for explaining (to Dan as well).

About "introducing them late and inconsistently" for the machine types
- I completely agree it was mostly always too late, e.g., in most
cases the new machine type will only be introduced by the one who will
need the first compatilble property (no matter which arch he/she is
working on and which module...).  It seems more ideal to me to just
introduce the major new machine types along with each of the QEMU
release (I mean the final release no matter which RC, it's just the
point when we push the release tag), but of course that'll be a burden
to the project maintainer or machine type maintainers... and anyway
ignoring compatible with development branches looks reasonable too.

In all cases, this patch looks good to me:
