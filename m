I can send a v2 (but will wait for any other feedback), or when applying
someone please replace the above paragraph with the following:

    "Andrea constructed a synthetic microbenchmark program (without any
    GCC optimizations or caching) which runs the CPUID instructions one
    million times in a loop.  This microbenchmark is meant to focus on
    measuring the performance of a specific area of the code -- in this
    case, to test the latency of VM-Exits."

(Rich, hope that reads better.  Thanks for the review.)
