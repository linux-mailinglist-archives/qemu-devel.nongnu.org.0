Oops sorry about those - serves me right for trying to re-spin too quickly.

Yeah it's a hangover from the previous phrasing. Our current usage
certainly isn't just for wrapped functions - qemu_mutex_lock_iothread and
friends for example are very specifically qemu utility functions rather
than wrapped functions.

We also have a bunch of static functions that should really not have the
prefix - qemu_kvm_start_vcpu for example looses nothing by just being
kvm_start_vcpu.

We also have functions that could arguably just use a subsystem prefix -
for example qemu_chr_fe_accept_input is very much a thing you only call
when dealing with chardev frontends (chr_fe).

I'm certainly not proposing mass renames but it's clear our usage is
wider than just wrapped functions.

If I re-arrange slightly we can roll from qemu_ to public functions:

  Function Naming Conventions
  ---------------------------

  The ``qemu_`` prefix is used for utility functions that are widely
  called from across the code-base. This includes wrapped versions of
  standard library functions (e.g. ``qemu_strtol``) where the prefix is
  added to the library function name to alert readers that they are
  seeing a wrapped version.

  Public functions from a file or subsystem (declared in headers) tend
  to have a consistent prefix to show where they came from. For example,
  ``tlb_`` for functions from ``cputlb.c`` or ``cpu_`` for functions
  from cpus.c.

  If there are two versions of a function to be called with or without a
  lock held, the function that expects the lock to be already held
  usually uses the suffix ``_locked``.

What do you think?

(note to self, _impl seems like another convention we should document at
some point).
