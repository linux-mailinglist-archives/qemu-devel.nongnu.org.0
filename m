Can you clarify exactly what "node 0" means?  Qemu and the guest
kernel each have node numberings, which I don't think are necessarily
the same.  With PAPR's scheme, it's not totally clear what "node 0"
even means.

Hmm.  I find that a bit hard to follow.  So IIUC, what's going on is
you start out by treating every node as as distant as possible from
every other: they have a unique value at every level of the
associativity array.  Then you collapse together nodes that are
supposed to be closer by making some of their associativity entries
match.  Is that right?

This function reinforces my feeling that pre-PAPRizing the distances
might not be the best idea.  It could go directly from the user
distance to level just as easily.

Ok, I follow this description better than the one in the commit message.

So, I don't think you need this logic.  It doesn't really matter which
associativity value you let win, as long as you're consistent.  So you
can just base it on src < dst, rather than assooc_src < assoc_dst.
But src <=3D dst always, because of the way you've constructed the loops.

Don't you need to match the values a all levels >=3D n_level, rather
than just n_level?  AFAICT it doesn't make sense for two components to
be in the same associativity domain at one level, but different
domains at "bigger" levels (i.e. something like two cores sharing an
L2 cache, but not an L3 cache).
