Nothing prevents us from describing those properties inside the
same property array.

More precisely, it is
  device_class_set_props(dc, foo);

which is supposed to become a one-line wrapper to
object_class_add_field_properties().

They should become exactly the same method, just with a different
allow_set function.

(There's also the possibility we let the class provide a default
allow_set function, and both would become 100% the same)

I'm not worried about this direction of conversion (which is
easy).  I'm worried about the function call => QAPI schema
conversion.  Function calls are too flexible and requires parsing
and executing C code.  Requiring all property descriptions to be
evaluated at compilation time is an intentional feature of the
new API.

I don't agree the function call is a tiny bit better.  In the
best case, I find it a tiny bit worse.
