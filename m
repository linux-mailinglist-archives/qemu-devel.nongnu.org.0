This bug seems not to be a problem, and may reflect an issue with
NetBSD.  Even though the decode of the features1 register does not
include MONITOR/MWAIT, that capability is separately reported on a
separate line, further down (apologies in advance for any confusing
line-wrap):

Title:
  -cpu haswell / broadwell have no MONITOR in features1

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  In qemu 2.9.0 if you run

      qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu Broadwell (or Haswell)

  then the CPU features1 flag include the SSE3 bit, but do NOT include
  the MONITOR/MWAIT bit.  This is so even when the host includes the
  features.

  Additionally, running qemu in this manner results in several error messag=
