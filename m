Because it happens to be set in the a57 initfn, and it's harmless
if we're not using TCG. I feel like some of your take on this set of
functions comes from thinking of max_initfn as in some sense the
'primary' function here, when it's the other way around : a57_initfn
is the standard kind of CPU initfn (behaving in and written the same
way as a53_initfn and a72_initfn), whereas max_initfn is an odd
special case which happens for convenience-of-implementation
to piggyback on the a57 implementation.

Ah, that's the other way around -- yes, for 'max' we should be using a
more generic value, not accidentally using 'cortex-a57'. (Linux doesn't
in practice care IIRC, which is why this bug hasn't been noticed.) But
for an actual cortex-a57 model we should report as arm,cortex-a57.

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/cpus.yaml
is the official list of permitted strings, incidentally.

The things that make it an A57 are all the feature flag and ID
register values (which is is what tells the TCG implementation
how the CPU should behave). The MIDR value is the least interesting
bit of the a57_initfn in some ways: it doesn't change the QEMU
emulation's behaviour and mostly guests don't care what the value
is except for purposes of installing errata workarounds that don't
matter for QEMU: your average guest would work just as well with
any MIDR...

Yes in theory (you'll see that we have a bunch of field definitions already
which we don't yet implement, because we tend to define all the fields
for an ID register at the point where we want to access one field), but
on the other hand there's usually no need to actually use them unless
we're adding the emulation for the feature, so the question is: what would
you do with them if you added them?
