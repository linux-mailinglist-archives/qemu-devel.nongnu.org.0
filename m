Yes, although I believe a stronger distinction between the images
originally targeted by avocado.utils.vmimage and those other images
should probably exist.  One of the reasons that make me think so is
that the images obtained through vmimage *should* be configurable by
the accompanying avocado.utils.cloudinit library.

I think released images are just fine.

FIY, with regards to custom iamges: the Avocado-VT JeOS images are
based on Fedora, and can be recreated with the kickstart files that
are also in-tree.  Making the custom binary file reproducible is,
AFAICT good enough.

I'd be happy to setup a secure upload mechanism, say, ftp+ssl, so that
"image maintainers" can upload new images.

I don't see why not.

Of course the best scenario would be to rely on some bigger
institution, say an University decides to host this archive of images,
and others decide to mirror them.  Until then, if it's decided to push
forward the use of the "avocado-project.org" site, the chances of it
going away are basically if I fail to have $5/month to keep it
running, so hopefully (I mean it) this won't be an issue :)

And thans for the ping, although I was really in need of a brick thrown
at my head to wake me up on this thread! :)
