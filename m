Hi Michael and Pavel,

The USART was based on the ATMega2560.
It was designed for testing so its functionality is somewhat limited.

Peripherals seem to vary between AVR chips so the configuration in the 2560 may not match other chips, especially the older ones.
From memory, the only shared registers in the 2560 USART are the PRR's, which we implemented by adding single byte memory regions during board initialisation (so that the memory region wasn't part of any one device).
I expect there are cleaner ways to do it.

Kind regards,
Sarah Harris
