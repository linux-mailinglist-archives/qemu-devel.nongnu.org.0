I've read the discussion around patches:
"monitor: increase amount of data for monitor to read"
and realized the problem.

It seems that my patch actually has some bugs with HMP and OOB
because of suspend/resume.

IIUC there are some approaches to fix them:

1) Input buffer
  1. Add input buffer for Monitor struct
  2. Handle commands from monitor_xxx_read callbacks one by one
  3. Schedule BH to handle remaining bytes in the buffer

2) Input buffer for suspend/resume
  1. Add input buffer for Monitor struct
  2. Handle multiple commands until monitor is not suspended
  3. If monitor suspended, put remaining data to the buffer
  4. Handle remaining data in the buffer when we get resume

We use QEMU 2.12 which doesn't have the full support of OOB and for which=
 it's
enough to fix HMP case by separating can_read callbacks. But those who us=
e
a newer version of QEMU can use OOB feature to improve HMP/QMP performanc=
e.
So, I'm not sure there's a big sense in introducing some buffers.

Regards,
Yury
