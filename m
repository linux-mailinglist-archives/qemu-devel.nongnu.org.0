I think it was overkill on my part.  Though it appears I am missing the
"zeroing" of the region once it got read.  Whoops.  Okay, those are easy
fixups.

I suppose.

I thought the reason for including them now was to avoid "if region size
== 4 vs 8 vs XX" logic at some mysterious time in the future.  But
certainly ripping it out so we only pass a single CRW at a time would
simplify this quite a bit.

Huh, look at that.  :)

Sure, that would be nice.  I'll add that as an additional patch to this
series, prior to this one.
