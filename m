I'm using the version 2.27 of glibc.

I downloaded the version 2.28 of glibc source for compilation and 
installation.

I found MAP_SYNC and MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE are defined in this version.

Seems it's older glibc version issue.

Good point.

So as you mentioned, it would be better to just have the following code:

#ifndef MAP_SYNC
#define MAP_SYNC 0
#endif

#ifndef MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE
#define MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE 0
#endif
