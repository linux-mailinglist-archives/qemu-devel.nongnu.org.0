That option adds memory in addition to the memory allocated with the 
'-m' flag, doesn't it? I looked into that option, and it seemed to me 
you can't back all memory this way.

Apart from that, the only advantage my solution has is that it's aware 
of any memory overlaying the memory-backed regions (i.e. memory backed 
by accessor functions). Maybe I don't need this for my use case, I'd 
have to test that.

The solution does stem from a specific use case, the ARM Trustzone 
forwarding described in the cover letter. Normally both OSes can pass 
data around by sharing physical addresses (potentially from anywhere in 
memory), so giving VMs an ability to access one another's memory no 
matter how it's backed allows for minimal trusted OS modification, just 
offsetting physical addresses. The interrupt functionality also reflects 
this, it's intended to pass around SMC data.

I realize that this kind of total memory sharing couples the two VMs 
tightly - this is why I'm asking for comments on this, perhaps there's a 
better solution for this specific scenario.

For what it's worth, the extent of this sharing can be reduced by using 
a limited MemoryRegion like it's done for secure and non-secure memory 
views on ARM.
