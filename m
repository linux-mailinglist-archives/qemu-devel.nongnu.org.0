Hi,

See the v1 cover letter here if you haven=E2=80=99t already:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2019-07/msg01290.html

I kept all patches from the previous version because Eric deemed the
patches I might have dropped useful.

I kept the way I implemented fixing overly long snapshot tables, namely
by discarding all snapshots past the maximum end.  Eric criticized this,
because this is indiscriminate (and the last ones have been created the
most recently, but I=E2=80=99m not sure whether we=E2=80=99d generally ra=
ther keep the
oldest or the most recent ones.  Maybe best would be to drop every
second snapshot? :-)).
I kept it as it is, because everything else would require user
interaction.  We currently have no interactive check mode, and I feel
like this is not a place where we need it badly: We introduced our
current snapshot limits in such a way that no sane image would ever hit
them.  If you do hit them, changes are that your image is already
corrupted, so you probably no longer care about your snapshots anyway
and just want to copy the active layer off.

Furthermore, I felt like an interactive mode would be pretty hard to
test thoroughly.  I don=E2=80=99t want to introduce code that probably no=
body
will ever use and that is hardly tested.

I also tried Eric=E2=80=99s suggestion of using bdrv_preadv() in
qcow2_read_snapshots() to read all variable data at once, and while it
was very promising, it doesn=E2=80=99t allow us to skip data (which we mu=
st do
when we want to truncate extra data down to a sane size).  So all in all
I couldn=E2=80=99t make it work.


So, the changes in v2:
- Patch 1: Eric asked from some magic numbers to be removed (very
           reasonable), and endof() will help with that.
- Patch 2: See, it helps!
- Patch 4: Rebased conflicts (because of patch 2), and I should use
           BDRV_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES instead of INT_MAX when I mean the
           former
- Patch 7: Drop magic number [Eric]
- Patch 8: Drop magic number [Eric]
- Patch 10: Instead of dropping all unknown extra data when there is too
            much, just truncate it down to the maximum [Eric]
- Patch 11: When some snapshot table entry has too much extra data and
            we truncate it, that shortens the snapshot table length, so
            we should keep that in mind when calculating whether the
            table is too long
- Patch 12: Rebase conflicts, and dropped a magic number [Eric]
- Patch 14: Drop magic number [Eric]
- Patch 16: Simplified padding calculation [Eric], fixed one test case
            (I used =E2=80=9Csn-size=E2=80=9D instead of =E2=80=9Csn_size=
=E2=80=9D, oops), and added a
            test case for what happens when a snapshot table entry is
            too big and contains an entry with too much extra data (the
            latter should be fixed first and then we should look into
            whether the table is still too long)
