Ah, right, that's the other direction.  No, we do not currently support 
a single qemu block node backed by multiple NBD clients to one (or more, 
if they are serving identical content in a failover scenario) NBD 
servers.  Performance could indeed be potentially improved by doing 
that, but for now, every time qemu behaves as a new NBD client, it is 
via an additional block node.
