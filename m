The gcov tool is fairly noisy about missing files but that just
indicates the tests haven't exercised those code paths. "make check"
especially doesn't touch much of the TCG code and a chunk of floating
point.

So your failure mode is no report is generated at all? It's working for
me here.

We defend the build but I have just checked and it seems our
check_coverage script is currently failing:

  https://travis-ci.org/stsquad/qemu/jobs/567809808#L10328

But as it's an after_success script it doesn't fail the build.
