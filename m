Certainly if a 64-bit Mac machine were to be added today, I'd be inclined to copy 
mac_newworld.c into a separate file and give it a separate machine name for ppc64 to 
make a clear distinction between the two machines (and allow them to evolve 
separately). Unfortunately I have no idea as to what the reference machine for the 
PPC64 Mac machine was supposed to be which makes it harder to decide what to do :(

In my mind it feels like qemu-system-ppc is for 32-bit guests and qemu-system-ppc64 
is for 64-bit guests which I believe is consistent with how it currently works with 
MIPS and ARM (someone feel free to correct me here).


ATB,

Mark.
