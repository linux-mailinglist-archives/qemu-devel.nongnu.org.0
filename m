If we decide to keep it and not guard it by default, then we should test
and fix it now. Also, as we're already aware that it has insufficient
sanity checks for extension dependencies, then we should fix our general
extension dependency checking now too, in order to apply that to this.
IOW, trying to keep this, without some guard on it, opens a can of worms.
My vote is the same as it was before, merge this series and then revisit
this function when someone has a use/test case for it. Nobody said this
was never going to have a different implementation, just that the current
implementation is known-buggy and there's no reason to expose it now.

My only concern with the code deletion is that git-blame doesn't blame
deleted code. I think we should add a comment describing the history
which includes a git commit reference which can be used to see the
latest implementation.
