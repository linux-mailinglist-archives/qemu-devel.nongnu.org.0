And subchannel is one word in s390-speak.

I'm also curious about the big picture (what is in scope and what out
of scope). Your design should be evaluated in the light of intended
usage.

BTW have you had a look at this abandoned patch-set of mine:

https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-11/msg04220.html

We made some different design decisions, while aiming essentially for the
same. Maybe it's due to different scope, maybe not. For instance one
can't test IDA with PONG, I guess.

Halil
