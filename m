Yes. Eduardo and you should write some lines to explain this, and then
we will follow :)

I feel concerned because:
1/ Alistair series is very helpful to new users, and
2/ As the RX architecture series showed, today it is not very clear how
to correctly use cpu_models.

Eduardo is working on a series, I'll wait for his work.

Regards,

Phil.
