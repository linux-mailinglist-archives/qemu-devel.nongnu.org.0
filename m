Very old bug. If anyone sees this behavior, please re-file against a
supported release (5.0 at time of writing, soon to be 5.1) and please
paste a full command-line and steps to reproduce.

(To my knowledge, this bug is not present in modern QEMU builds, but do
not know when it would have changed.)

Title:
  savevm fails with inserted CD, "Device '%s' is writable but does not
  support  snapshots."

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  yesterday unfortunately a customer reported a failed snapshot of his
  VM. Going through the logfile I discovered:

  "Device 'ide1-cd0' is writable but does not support snapshots"

  this is with qemu-1.2.0 and 1.0.1 at least...

  Why writeable?
  Even if I specify "-drive ...,readonly=3Don,snapshot=3Doff" to qemu the m=
onitor-command sees the CD-ROM-device as being writeable?!

  Somewhere I saw a "hint" for blockdev.c:
  =3D=3D=3D snip =3D=3D=3D

       case IF_SD:

  after installing with this small patch applied it works, so insert CD, sa=
vevm <somename> succeeds.
  This should be fixed at all correct places, and the tags "readonly=3Don,s=
napshot=3Doff" should do it, too. Or even just work after specifying a driv=
e being a CD-rom should do the trick ;-)

  Another "bad habit" is, that the ISO/DVD-file has to be writeable to
  be changed?

  Thnx for attention and regards,

  Oliver.
