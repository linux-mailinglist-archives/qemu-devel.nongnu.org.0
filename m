QEMU is only bypassed for virtqueue accesses. Everything else still
goes through the virtio-pci emulation in QEMU (VIRTIO configuration
space, status register). vDPA doesn't change this.

Existing vhost-user messages can be kept if they are useful (e.g.
virtqueue state tracking). So I think the situation is no different than
with the existing vhost-user protocol.

I think "Inflight I/O tracking" can only be used when request processing
is idempotent? In other words, it can only be used when submitting the
same request multiple times is safe.

A silly example where this recovery mechanism cannot be used is if a
device has a persistent counter that is incremented by the request. The
guest can't be sure that the counter will be incremented exactly once.

Another example: devices that support requests with compare-and-swap
semantics cannot use this mechanism. During recover the compare will
fail if the request was just completing when the backend crashed.

Do I understand the limitations of this mechanism correctly? It doesn't
seem general and I doubt it can be applied to all existing device types.

It eliminates one layer of device emulation (virtio-pci). Fewer
registers to emulate means a smaller attack surface.

It's possible to take things further, maybe with the proposed ioregionfd
mechanism, where the VMM's KVM_RUN loop no longer handles MMIO/PIO
exits. A separate process can handle them. Maybe some platform devices
need CPU state access though.

BTW I think the goal of removing as much emulation from the VMM as
possible is interesting.

Did you have some other approach in mind to remove the PCI and
virtio-pci device from the VMM?

There is no third process in mpqemu. The VMM uses a UNIX domain socket
to communicate directly with the device backend. There is a PCI "proxy"
device in the VMM that does this communication when the guest accesses
registers. The device backend has a PCI "remote" host controller that a
PCIDevice instance is plugged into and the UNIX domain socket protocol
commands are translated into PCIDevice operations.

This is exactly the same as vfio-user. The only difference is that
vfio-user uses an existing set of commands, whereas mpqemu defines a new
protocol that will eventually need to provide equivalent functionality.

vfio-user only needs a UNIX domain socket. The muser.ko kernel module
that was discussed after last KVM Forum is not used by vfio-user.
