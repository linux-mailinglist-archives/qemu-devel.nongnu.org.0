This is because what sits on the bus is not a floppy disk, but a floppy
drive. FloppyDrive is also what the type is called.

The disk is represented by the BlockDriverState (the actual image file)
that is inserted in the BlockBackend (which is logically part of the
drive).

Hm... I guess hotplugging floppy drives might actually have worked,
though I have never tried it on real hardware. I'm pretty sure it wasn't
an official feature, though, and ACPI tables certainly won't magically
change if you do this because (apart from polling, I guess) software has
no way to detect that you tinkered with the floppy cable. :-)

But we don't even emulate floppy controllers that can have more than two
floppy drives:

    $ x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -device floppy -device floppy -device floppy
    qemu-system-x86_64: -device floppy: Can't create floppy unit 2, bus supports only 2 units

This is checked in floppy_drive_realize(), so it applies to all
variants of the controller.

If you want more floppy drives, you have to create a second controller
(with a different iobase). Though I don't think I actually got this
working when I tried. I wasn't sure if the problem was the emulation or
the guest OSes (or SeaBIOS actually for DOS).

Maybe be more specific to have: "floppy (drive)" and "blk (disk)".
Because the ASCII schema is actually true, though you seem to have
misunderstood what each item in it is supposed to represent.

Actually "blk (disk)" is not 100% accurate either because the drive
always has a BlockBackend present. It's really the BlockDriverState
inserted into the BlockBackend that is the disk.

In summary, to be honest, I believe since its qdevification, floppy is
one of the block devices that is modelled the best on the QOM + block
backend level. Only SCSI might be comparable, but IDE, virtio-blk and
usb-storage are a mess in comparison.
