Public bug reported:

The official documentation for the user-space emulator[1] contains many
references to binary blobs no longer provided by  QEMU.org for download.
The parts mentioning them should be rephrased to avoid confusion and
instructions for building these components should be provided (maybe as
a reference to the LFS book with some scripts, or... cut a deal with
some super slim Linux distros). The specific parts are:

* qemu-XXX-i386-wine.tar.gz, a wine build under the prefix /wine.
* qemu-runtime-i386-XXX-.tar.gz, a glibc build.

=C2=A0=C2=A0[1]: https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/user/main.html

In addition, the documentation contains many other instances of
inexistent "tar.gz" files, such as in "Network emulation". Most of these
are inherited from the days of texi documentation more than 10 years
ago, and they are so old that GitHub's blame have become unreliable.
Someone really should run `fgrep -r 'tar.gz' doc' on the QEMU source
tree.

The issue was previously reported as [2], but nobody bother enough to
google the filename to find out where the confused user got the idea
from.
