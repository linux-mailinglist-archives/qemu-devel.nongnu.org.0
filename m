I'm failing to see how this is supposed to happen.  The guest will issue
requests bigger than the cluster size; why would it cause RMW?

Big logical_block_size would cause RMW in the guest if it wants to
perform smaller writes, but that's up to the user to take this tradeoff,
isn't it?

Do I get you right that your suggestion is to cap the block size
property at 2MB?

Thanks,
