Accident.

I'll drop them,

I admit I wobble between

    raise QAPISemError(info, "some lengthy error message text with %s"
                       % argument)

and

    raise QAPISemError(info,
                       "some lengthy error message text with %s" % argument)

and

    raise QAPISemError(
        info, "some lengthy error message text with %s" % argument)

The first looks okay, but as a rule, lines should be broken at an
operator with lowest precedence.

The second tends to produce long lines.

I'm still getting used to the third.

I'll have another look.

Thanks!
