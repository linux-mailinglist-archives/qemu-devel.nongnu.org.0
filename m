Yes, goto is complicated and we shouldn't make that worse by using a
code pattern that encourages mistakes IMHO.

It depends on what you are aiming to achieve.

In almost all cases where we forgot to initialize something, all-zeros
is the value that we would have wanted to be present. IOW, init=zero
will (almost) always make the code do what we wanted it to do, and thus
is the safe option to make QEMU robust.

Using a non-zero value will be potentially dangerous in a number of
possible ways. It will lead to loops iterating when they should not,
potentially even infinite loops. It will lead to reads/writes off
the end of arrays. It will lead to attempts to free() invalid pointers.
Essentially all the ways in which an uninitialized value can make the
code go wrong wil still potentially happen if we initialized to a
non-zero value. The only benefit is that it will go horribly wrong
in the same way each time.

IOW...

* If you want the application to be robust and generally "do the
  right thing", even in the face of missing initializers, then
  using -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero is the right answer.

* If you want the application to go horribly wrong, but in a
  repeatable manner, then -ftrivial-auto-var-init=pattern is the
  right answer

Personally I prefer QEMU to be robust and thus believe we should
initialize to zero in real world deployments.

Potentially there's a case for CI jobs to use a non-zero pattern
though to try to expose edge cases.

With regards,
Daniel
