Part of the problem with the kernel is the historical precedent they
had set. The issue of GPL compliance only become prominent much later
after (closed source) loadable modules were already widely in use. They
tried to lock the door after the horse had already bolted by adding
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.

We can avoid this trapped by clearly documenting our license expectations
from the very start. ie state that we consider any plugins to be derived
works and to be bound by the terms of the GPL. This doesn't mean the
plugins themselves have to be GPL, but they have to be under terms that
allow relicensing to the GPL, in order to be license compatible.=20

We could even go as far as having the plugin registration API require
that the plugin explicitly declare its license and we can log this
license at time of loading. If people use a non-GPL compatible license
it will be clearly visible as non-compatible, or if they lie and pretend
to be GPL then they would be willfully violating.

Yep, the code only has to be provided to the people who receive the
plugin binary. Those people can't be prevented from redistributing
it further though.

The problem with waiting for a problem to arise is that you have set a
precedent that its ok. We are in a stronger enforcement position if we
can set expectations accurately from day one, avoiding the trap the
kernel had which needed to try to enforce after the fact.

So from that POV, I'd be strongly in favour of technical measures that
force the plugin to be rebuilt against each new QEMU version.

This doesn't need to be module signing - it could be as simple as
requiring the plugin to export a symbol "module_version" which must
exactly match the QEMU version, or refuse to load it. If we want to
be even more strict we could generate a random hash in each QEMU
rebuild, which is the similar level of strictness to kernel signing
