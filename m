Indeed they don't run on GitLab due to that flag, but I run them locally
before sending a SD/MMC pull request (along with older images that are
not available anymore on the internet but are still in my local Avocado
cache).

Great.

OK :/

OK, this is a good start point. I'll look at the memory accesses
(certainly not today, but that problem is of my interest).
