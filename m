Sounds good, I'll be happy to test it.

Indeed "no event" is something that the fw deals with gracefully. (IIRC
I wanted to cover a "spurious SMI" explicitly.)

It didn't occur to me that you could dynamically size e.g. a package
object in AML. Based on my reading of the ACPI spec, "VarPackageOp" can
take a *runtime* "NumElements", so if you did two loops, the first loop
could count the pending stuff, and then a VarPackageOp could be used
with just the right NumElements... Anyway, I digress :)

haha, thanks :)
