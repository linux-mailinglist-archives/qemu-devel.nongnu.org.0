Yes, this is the case you were concerned about, but the problem is for a
slightly different reason. *If* the PMU feature was getting added to the
kvm32 'host' CPU type, then both tests here would be correct: the feature
would be present, but arm_set_pmu() would report "feature not supported",
as that's what KVM would report on kvm32. However, I see now that
target/arm/kvm32.c:kvm_arm_get_host_cpu_features() does *not* add
ARM_FEATURE_PMU, like it does in the target/arm/kvm64.c implementation
and in the 32-bit CPU models like the Cortex-A15. Indeed, had this
test been run with '-cpu cortex-a15', and the kvm32 host allowed that
CPU type, then this test would also work. We want to use 'host' here
though, as that's more appropriate, so the fix is simply to remove the
tests on kvm32 like below.

Peter, would you mind running your test on the kvm32 machine with this
change before I send a v7? Actually, do I need to send a v7? Or is
type of fixup OK to do on merge?

Thanks,
drew
