The vhost-user specification is not clearly stating the expected
behavior from a backend program whenever the client disconnects.

This patch addresses the issue by defining the default behavior and
proposing an alternative through a command line option.

By default, a backend program will terminate whenever the client
disconnects, unless told otherwise through the newly introduced
option --keep-listening.
