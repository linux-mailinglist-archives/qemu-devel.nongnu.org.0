>=20

Ultimately, it would be nice to get LUKS 2 support in qemu too, but=20
that's a much bigger job.  This is fine for now.

On Fedora 29, 'cryptsetup --help | grep -A1 type' shows:
   -M, --type=3DSTRING               Type of device metadata: luks, plain=
,
                                   loopaes, tcrypt

but that is just 'luks', not 'luks1'.

On CentOS 6 (yeah, I know, not relevenant to qemu any more), --type is=20
unsupported.  But I didn't check our other range of supported systems.=20
My point, however, is whether this patch needs to be conditionalized=20
based on what cryptsetup actually supports.

I could not quickly determine if there is some sort of safe no-op=20
'cryptsetup --type=3DFOO action /safe/device' that can be used to tell if=
=20
--type=3DFOO is recognized.

Otherwise, this makes sense to me.

--=20
