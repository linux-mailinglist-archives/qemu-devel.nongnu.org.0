I've spent a couple of days poking at the llvm disassembler.

As a general-purpose disassembler, it's less than ideal.

(1) The disassembler is not "inclusive".  You present it with
    a specific cpu configuration, and anything that cpu does
    not support is considered invalid.  There is no "maximum"
    configuration that attempts to decode any insn in the ISA.

(2) All configuration is done via strings, so you can't
    programatically tell what's supported.  I think they're
    expecting all of these strings to come from the
    command line.

(3) If you include a unrecognized cpu feature, an error is
    printed to stderr.  Which suggests that we would easily
    wind up with problems between llvm versions.

(4) "Probing" what is supported with a particular version is
    done via "+help", which prints what is supported to stdout.

If we have a submodule, is it possible to have a local branch of that?  The
only thing I can see that would fix any of the above is to modify llvm to give
us a more usable interface.

In the short-term, I guess I'll look into updating our capstone branch.  And
possibly reject using the system version -- either use the git submodule or
nothing.

Thoughts?
