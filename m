fatal-warnings, but sure:

Doesn't really help (me) much as the cause of the error is much earlier?

I thought so too, but removing that g_source_unref() causes other
problems.

Yes, it just makes it use the same path as all the other FDs/sources.

Which "the function" do you mean?

I'm not really sure I understand what you're actually saying about
my patch though. Are you saying I shouldn't do this? But then I don't
really understand why. Why should the "main" FD be different from any of
the VQ FDs, and not just all go into the hashtable? I basically arrived
at this patch by noting that the other FDs were OK (the warning only
occurs for this one), and the cleanup for the others is handled
correctly while destroying the hashtable. Having to clean this
particular one up manually seemed pointless (though I couldn't even make
it work correctly).
