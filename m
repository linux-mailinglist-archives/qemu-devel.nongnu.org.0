When QEMU exposes a VirtIO-RNG device to the guest, that device needs a
source of entropy, and that source needs to be "non-blocking", like
`/dev/urandom`.  However, currently QEMU defaults to the problematic
`/dev/random`, which is "blocking" (as in, it waits until sufficient
entropy is available).

Why prefer `/dev/urandom` over `/dev/random`?
---------------------------------------------

The man pages of urandom(4) and random(4) state:

    "The /dev/random device is a legacy interface which dates back to a
    time where the cryptographic primitives used in the implementation
    of /dev/urandom were not widely trusted.  It will return random
    bytes only within the estimated number of bits of fresh noise in the
    entropy pool, blocking if necessary.  /dev/random is suitable for
    applications that need high quality randomness, and can afford
    indeterminate delays."

Further, the "Usage" section of the said man pages state:

    "The /dev/random interface is considered a legacy interface, and
    /dev/urandom is preferred and sufficient in all use cases, with the
    exception of applications which require randomness during early boot
    time; for these applications, getrandom(2) must be used instead,
    because it will block until the entropy pool is initialized.

    "If a seed file is saved across reboots as recommended below (all
    major Linux distributions have done this since 2000 at least), the
    output is cryptographically secure against attackers without local
    root access as soon as it is reloaded in the boot sequence, and
    perfectly adequate for network encryption session keys.  Since reads
    from /dev/random may block, users will usually want to open it in
    nonblocking mode (or perform a read with timeout), and provide some
    sort of user notification if the desired entropy is not immediately
    available."

And refer to random(7) for a comparison of `/dev/random` and
`/dev/urandom`.

    - - -

Given the above, change the entropy source for VirtIO-RNG device to
`/dev/urandom`.
