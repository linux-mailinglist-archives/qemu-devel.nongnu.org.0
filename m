Right -- well, it isn't NOT PEP 257 either. It just suggests you have to 
describe these features, but it doesn't say HOW.

Hard to search for in my opinion; you want to search for "sphinx python 
domain", and then click on "field lists" on the sidebar.

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html#info-field-lists

It has a special understanding for:

param/parameter/arg/argument/key/keyword: I prefer "param" here. 
Possibly key/keyword if we use a **kwargs form with a key that we 
specially recognize, but I've not tested that yet. I know pycharm 
understands "param" in a semantic way, and that's been good enough for me.

type: Defines the type of a parameter. In my opinion, do not use this. 
Let native type hints do the lifting.

raises/raise/except/exception: I prefer "raises". "raises ErrorType 
when...." is a good sentence.

var/ivar/cvar: Describes a variable, presumably in the body of the 
function below. I've never used this, I always describe it in prose instead.

vartype: Defines a type for a variable; I would again defer to the 
native type system instead now.

returns/return: I prefer "returns" for grammatical reasons again. 
("Returns such-and-such when...")

rtype: again, type information. Don't use.

meta: For directives to sphinx, e.g. :meta private: or :meta public: to 
toggle the visibility class from its default. I don't use this.


None of these are validated or checked in any meaningful way; you can 
use arbitrarily field lists (and I do in a few places!) to define your 
own terms and so on.


(I would like to improve autodoc in the future to validate your 
docstrings such that you can enforce :param:, :raises: and :return: and 
it uses the type hints and introspection information to raise an error 
when you make an obvious mistake. I am not there yet, but I am using 
Peter Maydell's work to help inform how I might write such an extension 
to autodoc. This work is not critical, but it will likely occur 
upstream, outside of the QEMU context because I believe this is a good 
thing to do for the ecosystem in general, to allow autodoc to function 
slightly more like e.g. Doxygen does.)

That I can do -- and I will double down on my IOU for a more formal 
style guide: https://gitlab.com/jsnow/qemu/-/issues/7

I didn't bother writing it in any of the commits because I felt like 
it'd get lost there and would be mostly useless; but a .rst doc inside 
the package folder would be hard to miss.

I plan to check in something like ./python/README.rst or 
./python/CODING_STYLE.rst to try and formalize a lot of what I am doing 
here, where it's going to be harder to miss.

Hm. Attribute yes, actually. variable and parameter no -- sphinx does 
not presently provide syntax or roles for creating anchors to parameter 
names or variables, so they are not able to be cross-referenced.

Attributes CAN be cross-referenced, but only when they are documented.

Another style guide thing:

#: x is a number that represents "The Answer". See `Douglas Adams`_.
self.x = 42

You can use the special comment form "#:" to add a one-line description 
of an attribute that Sphinx will pick up. Sphinx skips these attributes 
otherwise. If you consider them part of the interface of the module, 
it's maybe a good idea to do this.

You can also use docstrings, but the ordering changes:

self.x = 42
"""x is a number that represents "The Answer". See `Douglas Adams`_.

I kind of like the #: form because it announces what follows, but I 
admit it's a bit of special sphinx magic.

It specifically targets only cross-references of that exact type. In the 
case that the :any: reference is ambiguous, :func: is the disambiguation.
