I'm not sure if we need this at all.

This function is only called from get_physical_address_pmp() which
then calculates the maximum size using pmp_is_range_in_tlb().

I suspect that we could just use sizeof(target_ulong) as the fallback
for every time size == 0. Then pmp_is_range_in_tlb() will set the
tlb_size to the maximum possible size of the PMP region.

As a plus, we would remove some macros as well, so what about (untested)?

    if (size == 0) {
        if (riscv_cpu_mxl(env) == MXL_RV32) {
            pmp_size = 4;
        } else {
            pmp_size = 8;
        }
    } else {
        pmp_size = size;
    }
