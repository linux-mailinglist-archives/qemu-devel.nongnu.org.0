Ok, that sounds like a reasonable point. Not that I have a better idea
how to achieve that, though... we could also log a more verbose error
message to the kernel log, but that's not necessarily where a user will
look first.

Ideally, we'd want to have the user space program setting up things
querying the general compatibility for migration (so that it becomes
their problem on how to alert the user to problems :), but I'm not sure
how to eliminate the race between asking the vendor driver for
compatibility and getting the result of that operation.

Unless we introduce an interface that can retrieve _all_ results
together with the written value? Or is that not going to be much of a
problem in practice?
