I searched around but couldn't find anything talking about this case for
real hardware. I also looked at some HDL code for FPGAs that do DMA, but
it seems most of the PCI DMA components are contained in proprietary
IPs, though maybe I'm missing something (I've never programmed
a DMA-capable FPGA).

Could this be something that we check for in the
pci_dma_* functions in hw/pci/pci.h? There we still have context about
the source device for the dma read/write and could, compare addr against
the device's PCI BARr's. Not sure about:
1.) How to do this without the overhead of convering the addr
to a MemoryRegion, which is normally done, once, at the flatview_write
stage.
2.) What to do if we catch such a DMA request? Quietly drop it?
3.) Non-PCI devices.

I think this still doesn't cover the even crazier case where:
CPU writes to DEV_A's MMIO
DEV_A writes to DEV_B's MMIO
DEV_B writes to DEV_A's MMIO
and neither DEV_A or DEV_B use BHs...
