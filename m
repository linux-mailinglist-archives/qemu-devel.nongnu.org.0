I'm not sure there's an actual problem here.  I found the terminology
unfamiliar, that's all.

My main concern was that people might be confused about the kernel ABI
here, but it sounds like your interpretation is as I intended.

But by all means clarify the comments if you think there's a risk of
QEMU folks being confused.
