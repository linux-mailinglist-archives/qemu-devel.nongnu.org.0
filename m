This second point is such a good idea that we already have defined
how todo this in QEMU - see the docs/interop/vhost-user.json file.
This specifies metadata files that should be installed into a
defined location such that QEMU/libvirt/other mgmt app can locate
vhost-user impls for each type of device, and priortize between
different impls.
