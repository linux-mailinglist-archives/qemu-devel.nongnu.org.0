Vhost-user already does something similar; see it's
vhost_user_fill_set_mem_table_msg:

            msg->payload.memory.regions[*fd_num].userspace_addr =
                reg->userspace_addr;
            msg->payload.memory.regions[*fd_num].memory_size =
                reg->memory_size;
            msg->payload.memory.regions[*fd_num].guest_phys_addr =
                reg->guest_phys_addr;
            msg->payload.memory.regions[*fd_num].mmap_offset = offset;

Note you're not needing to map the fd with an offset on the qemu side,
it's something only needed on the remote.
