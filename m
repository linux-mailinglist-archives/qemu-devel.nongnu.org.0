There are two sheepdog-related bits in libvirt which are IMO completely
separate:

1) the blockdev backend handling for the 'sheepdog' protocol driver

 This is the one connected to qemu's deprecation, but until there is a
 qemu version where sheepdog wasn't deprecated/removed supported by
 libvirt we can't really do much about it.

 On the other hand it's just a few generators of arguments for
 -drive/-blockdev so the burden is very low.

2) the sheepdog storage driver

 This one is completely separate from qemu and we can decide to
 deprecate/delete it at our own schedule as it will not influence the
 ability to start VMs.

 The last non-housekeeping commit in that driver seems to be dated:
 Thu Jun 18 16:20:42 2015

 Similarly the burden of keeping this around is low, but I would not bat
 an eye if we remove it right away even.
