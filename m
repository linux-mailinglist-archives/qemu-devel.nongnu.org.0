I mean host-passthrough model is 'not' used here. Sorry to make it 
confusing.

Yes, you are right.
We have AAarch64 server with cpu based on Cortex-A72 and some extra 
instruction set added. Source host with cpu based on V1 and destination 
host with cpu based on V2 and they are compatible with Cortex-A72. We 
want to use a 'custom' cpu mode here to make it possible to do live 
migration between them. This is the scenario where the 'host' cpu model 
is not used since a 'custom' cpu model Cortex-A72 is used here . However 
the kvm-adjvtime feature is also need. So I think we should move 
kvm_arm_add_vcpu_properties to arm_cpu_post_init, instead of limited to 
'host' and 'max' cpu model[1].
