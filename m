Not really. As usual I find Meson really annoying to deal
with: it doesn't do things in the generally-standard-for-C-and-Unix
way by default, and it isn't flexible enough to be
configurable to do so. One of these days we're going to
find that its persistent inflexibility prevents us doing
something important rather than merely being an irritant.

That's not recursive make particularly, it's just that if
we want to build the same file twice we need to have a
subdirectory for each way of building it, as you note.
But in each of those subdirectories you can still use the same
directory layout the source tree has, which is what we
did with the old build system.

This is a silly scheme, because now you have an unnecessary
restriction that you can't have both foo_bar.c and
foo/bar.c. We don't have to pay for builds by the
subdirectory :-)

Generally at the point where I think "oh, maybe I should look
at the generator output" the output from make is no longer on
my terminal. So I just find the object file in the build tree
(not just for QEMU, but for anything I'm working on: IME
most projects put the object files in easy to guess places).
