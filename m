Alexandre (and Arnd too, or any other person knowledgeable in the area),

I just need to clarify a couple of details with you, please.

Firstly, here is what man page rtc(4) says:

"The /dev/rtc (or /dev/rtc0, /dev/rtc1, etc.) device can be opened
only once (until it is closed) and it is read-only. On read(2) and
select(2) the calling process is blocked until the next interrupt from
that RTC is received. Following the interrupt, the process can read a
long integer, of which the least significant byte contains a bit mask
encoding the types of interrupt that occurred, while the remaining 3
bytes contain the number of interrupts since the last read(2)."

So, it looks read() will always return only 4 bytes of useful info
(regardless of host being 32-bit/64-bit).

My questions are:

- Is the description in man page genuinely accurate?

- To me (but I am really an outsider to using RTC in applications),
this feature (blocking read()/select()) even looks very nice and
convenient, in all fairness. But I would like to ask you: Is this
feature used rarely or frequently by other libraries/tools/etc.? In
other words, is the feature "obscure" or "crucial" part of RTC kernel
support? Or, something in between?

- Does MC146818 support this feature?

Thanks a lot in advance for any response!

Aleksandar

P.S. for Arnd: I sent this message only to you, by mistake, around 15
