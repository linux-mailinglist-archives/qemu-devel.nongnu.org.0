Exactly.

And they can configure that by echoing the GPIO specifiers to
/sys/bus/platform/drivers/gpio-aggregator/new_device.

If their system has DT, another option is to describe the device in DT,
and add its compatible value to gpio_aggregator_dt_ids[], cfr. the
frobnicator example.

Sure. If anything is still unclear, please let me know!
Thanks!
