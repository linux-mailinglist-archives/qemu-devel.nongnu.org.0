Will add.

Will do.  (I wasn't sure, hence I put both years :-))

True, will remove this redundancy.

Your phrasing is indeed simpler and more to-the-point; will incorporate
it.

I'll also add similar sections about the other two MSRs: 'taa-no' and
'tsx-ctrl' (as mentioned here:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-01/msg03685.html).

Thanks for the careful review.
