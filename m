Yes, good point.  We can't just remove a vpfn when a page is unpinned
or else we'd lose information that the page potentially had been
dirtied while it was pinned.  Maybe that vpfn needs to move to a dirty
list and both the currently pinned vpfns and the dirty vpfns are walked
on a log_sync.  The dirty vpfns list would be cleared after a log_sync.
The container would need to know that dirty tracking is enabled and
only manage the dirty vpfns list when necessary.  Thanks,
