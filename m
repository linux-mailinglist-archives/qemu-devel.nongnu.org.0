I see.  So you're saying that it might be possible that my guest could be
generating TCG ops that can't be translated into PPC instructions because
the displacement value is to big.  While the same TCG ops can be translated
into x86 instructions because x86 allows for a bigger displacement value.
But on the other hand it could be some other problem causing me to have a
large displacement value.

In that case, I think it'd be super helpful if I print out this
displacement value in the TCG ops when running on PPC versus x86 because
they should be the same right?  What option in QEMU -d allows me to see
generated TCG ops?  Doing a -d --help shows the following options:

out_asm    show generated host assembly code for each compiled TB
in_asm     show target assembly code for each compiled TB
op         show micro ops for each compiled TB
op_opt     show micro ops (x86 only: before eflags optimization) and
after liveness analysis
int        show interrupts/exceptions in short format
exec       show trace before each executed TB (lots of logs)
cpu        show CPU state before block translation
mmu        log MMU-related activities
pcall      x86 only: show protected mode far calls/returns/exceptions
cpu_reset  show CPU state before CPU resets
ioport     show all i/o ports accesses
unimp      log unimplemented functionality
guest_errors log when the guest OS does something invalid (eg accessing a
non-existent register)

There doesn't seem to be any option to print out the TCG ops specifically?
Maybe I'll have to go into the code to add print statements that print out
the TCG ops?

-Thanks!, Wayne Li

<br>
This assertion is checking that we&#39;re not trying to fit too<br>
large a value into the host PPC branch instruction we just emitted.<br>
That is, tcg_out_bc() emits a PPC conditional branch instruction,<br>
which has a 14 bit field for the offset (it&#39;s a relative branch),<br>
and we know the bottom 2 bits of the target will be 0 (PPC insns<br>
being 4-aligned), so the distance between the current host PC<br>
and the target of the branch must fit in a signed 16-bit field.<br>
<br>
&quot;disp&quot; here stands for &quot;displacement&quot;.<br>
<br>
The PPC TCG backend only uses this for the TCG &#39;brcond&#39; and<br>
&#39;brcond2&#39; TCG intermediate-representation ops. It seems likely<br>
that the code for your target is generating TCG ops which have<br>
too large a gap between a brcond/brcond2 and the destination label.<br>
You could try using the various QEMU -d options to print out the<br>
guest instructions and the generated TCG ops to pin down what<br>
part of your target is trying to generate branches over too<br>
much code like this.<br>
<br>
&gt; Anyway, the thing is this problem has to be somehow related to<br>
&gt; the transfer of the code from a little-endian platform to a<br>
&gt; big-endian platform as our project works without any problem on<br>
&gt; little-endian platforms.<br>
<br>
In this case it isn&#39;t necessarily directly an endianness issue.<br>
The x86 instruction set provides conditional branch instructions<br>
which allow a 32-bit displacement value, so you&#39;re basically never<br>
going to overflow a conditional-branch there. PPC, being RISC,<br>
has more limited branch insns. You might also run into this<br>
if you tried to use aarch64 (64-bit) arm hosts, which are<br>
little-endian but have a 19-bit branch displacement limit,<br>
depending on just how big you&#39;ve managed to make your jumps.<br>
On the other hand, a 16-bit displacement is a jump over<br>
64K of generated code, which is huge for a single TCG<br>
generated translation block, so it could well be that you<br>
have an endianness bug in your TCG frontend which is causing<br>
you to generate an enormous TB by accident.<br>
