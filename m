This patch introduces the vfio-user protocol specification (formerly
known as VFIO-over-socket), which is designed to allow devices to be
emulated outside QEMU, in a separate process. vfio-user reuses the
existing VFIO defines, structs and concepts.

It has been earlier discussed as an RFC in:
"RFC: use VFIO over a UNIX domain socket to implement device offloading"

+vfio-user Protocol Specification
+********************************

+
+Introduction
+============
+vfio-user is a protocol that allows a device to be emulated in a separate
+process outside of a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). vfio-user devices consist
+of a generic VFIO device type, living inside the VMM, which we call the client,
+and the core device implementation, living outside the VMM, which we call the
+server.
+
+The vfio-user specification is partly based on the
+`Linux VFIO ioctl interface <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html>`_.
+
+VFIO is a mature and stable API, backed by an extensively used framework. The
+existing VFIO client implementation in QEMU (``qemu/hw/vfio/``) can be largely
+re-used, though there is nothing in this specification that requires that
+particular implementation. None of the VFIO kernel modules are required for
+supporting the protocol, on either the client or server side. Some source
+definitions in VFIO are re-used for vfio-user.
+
+The main idea is to allow a virtual device to function in a separate process in
+the same host over a UNIX domain socket. A UNIX domain socket (``AF_UNIX``) is
+chosen because file descriptors can be trivially sent over it, which in turn
+allows:
+
+* Sharing of client memory for DMA with the server.
+* Sharing of server memory with the client for fast MMIO.
+* Efficient sharing of eventfd's for triggering interrupts.
+
+Other socket types could be used which allow the server to run in a separate
+guest in the same host (``AF_VSOCK``) or remotely (``AF_INET``). Theoretically
+the underlying transport does not necessarily have to be a socket, however we do
+not examine such alternatives. In this protocol version we focus on using a UNIX
+domain socket and introduce basic support for the other two types of sockets
+without considering performance implications.
+
+While passing of file descriptors is desirable for performance reasons, support
+is not necessary for either the client or the server in order to implement the
+protocol. There is always an in-band, message-passing fall back mechanism.
+
+Overview
+========
+
+VFIO is a framework that allows a physical device to be securely passed through
+to a user space process; the device-specific kernel driver does not drive the
+device at all.  Typically, the user space process is a VMM and the device is
+passed through to it in order to achieve high performance. VFIO provides an API
+and the required functionality in the kernel. QEMU has adopted VFIO to allow a
+guest to directly access physical devices, instead of emulating them in
+software.
+
+vfio-user reuses the core VFIO concepts defined in its API, but implements them
+as messages to be sent over a socket. It does not change the kernel-based VFIO
+in any way, in fact none of the VFIO kernel modules need to be loaded to use
+vfio-user. It is also possible for the client to concurrently use the current
+kernel-based VFIO for one device, and vfio-user for another device.
+
+VFIO Device Model
+-----------------
+
+A device under VFIO presents a standard interface to the user process. Many of
+the VFIO operations in the existing interface use the ``ioctl()`` system call, and
+references to the existing interface are called the ``ioctl()`` implementation in
+this document.
+
+The following sections describe the set of messages that implement the vfio-user
+interface over a socket. In many cases, the messages are analogous to data
+structures used in the ``ioctl()`` implementation. Messages derived from the
+``ioctl()`` will have a name derived from the ``ioctl()`` command name.  E.g., the
+``VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` ``ioctl()`` command becomes a
+``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` message.  The purpose of this reuse is to share as
+much code as feasible with the ``ioctl()`` implementation``.
+
+Connection Initiation
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+After the client connects to the server, the initial client message is
+``VFIO_USER_VERSION`` to propose a protocol version and set of capabilities to
+apply to the session. The server replies with a compatible version and set of
+capabilities it supports, or closes the connection if it cannot support the
+advertised version.
+
+Device Information
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The client uses a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_INFO`` message to query the server for
+information about the device. This information includes:
+
+* The device type and whether it supports reset (``VFIO_DEVICE_FLAGS_``),
+* the number of device regions, and
+* the device presents to the client the number of interrupt types the device
+  supports.
+
+Region Information
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_INFO`` messages to query the
+server for information about the device's regions. This information describes:
+
+* Read and write permissions, whether it can be memory mapped, and whether it
+  supports additional capabilities (``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_``).
+* Region index, size, and offset.
+
+When a device region can be mapped by the client, the server provides a file
+descriptor which the client can ``mmap()``. The server is responsible for
+polling for client updates to memory mapped regions.
+
+Region Capabilities
+"""""""""""""""""""
+
+Some regions have additional capabilities that cannot be described adequately
+by the region info data structure. These capabilities are returned in the
+region info reply in a list similar to PCI capabilities in a PCI device's
+configuration space.
+
+Sparse Regions
+""""""""""""""
+A region can be memory-mappable in whole or in part. When only a subset of a
+region can be mapped by the client, a ``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_SPARSE_MMAP``
+capability is included in the region info reply. This capability describes
+which portions can be mapped by the client.
+
+.. Note::
+   For example, in a virtual NVMe controller, sparse regions can be used so
+   that accesses to the NVMe registers (found in the beginning of BAR0) are
+   trapped (an infrequent event), while allowing direct access to the doorbells
+   (an extremely frequent event as every I/O submission requires a write to
+   BAR0), found in the next page after the NVMe registers in BAR0.
+
+Device-Specific Regions
+"""""""""""""""""""""""
+
+A device can define regions additional to the standard ones (e.g. PCI indexes
+0-8). This is achieved by including a ``VFIO_REGION_INFO_CAP_TYPE`` capability
+in the region info reply of a device-specific region. Such regions are reflected
+in ``struct vfio_user_device_info.num_regions``. Thus, for PCI devices this
+value can be equal to, or higher than, ``VFIO_PCI_NUM_REGIONS``.
+
+Region I/O via file descriptors
+-------------------------------
+
+For unmapped regions, region I/O from the client is done via
+``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ/WRITE``.  As an optimization, ioeventfds or ioregionfds
+may be configured for sub-regions of some regions. A client may request
+information on these sub-regions via ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS``; by
+configuring the returned file descriptors as ioeventfds or ioregionfds, the
+server can be directly notified of I/O (for example, by KVM) without taking a
+trip through the client.
+
+Interrupts
+^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_IRQ_INFO`` messages to query the server
+for the device's interrupt types. The interrupt types are specific to the bus
+the device is attached to, and the client is expected to know the capabilities
+of each interrupt type. The server can signal an interrupt by directly injecting
+interrupts into the guest via an event file descriptor. The client configures
+how the server signals an interrupt with ``VFIO_USER_SET_IRQS`` messages.
+
+Device Read and Write
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+When the guest executes load or store operations to an unmapped device region,
+the client forwards these operations to the server with
+``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ`` or ``VFIO_USER_REGION_WRITE`` messages. The server
+will reply with data from the device on read operations or an acknowledgement on
+write operations. See `Read and Write Operations`_.
+
+Client memory access
+--------------------
+
+The client uses ``VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP`` messages to
+inform the server of the valid DMA ranges that the server can access on behalf
+of a device (typically, VM guest memory). DMA memory may be accessed by the
+server via ``VFIO_USER_DMA_READ`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_WRITE`` messages over the
+socket. In this case, the "DMA" part of the naming is a misnomer.
+
+Actual direct memory access of client memory from the server is possible if the
+client provides file descriptors the server can ``mmap()``. Note that ``mmap()``
+privileges cannot be revoked by the client, therefore file descriptors should
+only be exported in environments where the client trusts the server not to
+corrupt guest memory.
+
+See `Read and Write Operations`_.
+
+Client/server interactions
+==========================
+
+Socket
+------
+
+A server can serve:
+
+1) one or more clients, and/or
+2) one or more virtual devices, belonging to one or more clients.
+
+The current protocol specification requires a dedicated socket per
+client/server connection. It is a server-side implementation detail whether a
+single server handles multiple virtual devices from the same or multiple
+clients. The location of the socket is implementation-specific. Multiplexing
+clients, devices, and servers over the same socket is not supported in this
+version of the protocol.
+
+Authentication
+--------------
+
+For ``AF_UNIX``, we rely on OS mandatory access controls on the socket files,
+therefore it is up to the management layer to set up the socket as required.
+Socket types that span guests or hosts will require a proper authentication
+mechanism. Defining that mechanism is deferred to a future version of the
+protocol.
+
+Command Concurrency
+-------------------
+
+A client may pipeline multiple commands without waiting for previous command
+replies.  The server will process commands in the order they are received.  A
+consequence of this is if a client issues a command with the *No_reply* bit,
+then subsequently issues a command without *No_reply*, the older command will
+have been processed before the reply to the younger command is sent by the
+server.  The client must be aware of the device's capability to process
+concurrent commands if pipelining is used.  For example, pipelining allows
+multiple client threads to concurrently access device regions; the client must
+ensure these accesses obey device semantics.
+
+An example is a frame buffer device, where the device may allow concurrent
+access to different areas of video memory, but may have indeterminate behavior
+if concurrent accesses are performed to command or status registers.
+
+Note that unrelated messages sent from the server to the client can appear in
+between a client to server request/reply and vice versa.
+
+Implementers should be prepared for certain commands to exhibit potentially
+unbounded latencies.  For example, ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_RESET`` may take an
+arbitrarily long time to complete; clients should take care not to block
+unnecessarily.
+
+Socket Disconnection Behavior
+-----------------------------
+The server and the client can disconnect from each other, either intentionally
+or unexpectedly. Both the client and the server need to know how to handle such
+events.
+
+Server Disconnection
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+A server disconnecting from the client may indicate that:
+
+1) A virtual device has been restarted, either intentionally (e.g. because of a
+   device update) or unintentionally (e.g. because of a crash).
+2) A virtual device has been shut down with no intention to be restarted.
+
+It is impossible for the client to know whether or not a failure is
+intermittent or innocuous and should be retried, therefore the client should
+reset the VFIO device when it detects the socket has been disconnected.
+Error recovery will be driven by the guest's device error handling
+behavior.
+
+Client Disconnection
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+The client disconnecting from the server primarily means that the client
+has exited. Currently, this means that the guest is shut down so the device is
+no longer needed therefore the server can automatically exit. However, there
+can be cases where a client disconnection should not result in a server exit:
+
+1) A single server serving multiple clients.
+2) A multi-process QEMU upgrading itself step by step, which is not yet
+   implemented.
+
+Therefore in order for the protocol to be forward compatible, the server should
+respond to a client disconnection as follows:
+
+ - all client memory regions are unmapped and cleaned up (including closing any
+   passed file descriptors)
+ - all IRQ file descriptors passed from the old client are closed
+ - the device state should otherwise be retained
+
+The expectation is that when a client reconnects, it will re-establish IRQ and
+client memory mappings.
+
+If anything happens to the client (such as qemu really did exit), the control
+stack will know about it and can clean up resources accordingly.
+
+Security Considerations
+-----------------------
+
+Speaking generally, vfio-user clients should not trust servers, and vice versa.
+Standard tools and mechanisms should be used on both sides to validate input and
+prevent against denial of service scenarios, buffer overflow, etc.
+
+Request Retry and Response Timeout
+----------------------------------
+A failed command is a command that has been successfully sent and has been
+responded to with an error code. Failure to send the command in the first place
+(e.g. because the socket is disconnected) is a different type of error examined
+earlier in the disconnect section.
+
+.. Note::
+   QEMU's VFIO retries certain operations if they fail. While this makes sense
+   for real HW, we don't know for sure whether it makes sense for virtual
+   devices.
+
+Defining a retry and timeout scheme is deferred to a future version of the
+protocol.
+
+Message sizes
+-------------
+
+Some requests have an ``argsz`` field. In a request, it defines the maximum
+expected reply payload size, which should be at least the size of the fixed
+reply payload headers defined here. The *request* payload size is defined by the
+usual ``msg_size`` field in the header, not the ``argsz`` field.
+
+In a reply, the server sets ``argsz`` field to the size needed for a full
+payload size. This may be less than the requested maximum size. This may be
+larger than the requested maximum size: in that case, the full payload is not
+included in the reply, but the ``argsz`` field in the reply indicates the needed
+size, allowing a client to allocate a larger buffer for holding the reply before
+trying again.
+
+In addition, during negotiation (see  `Version`_), the client and server may
+each specify a ``max_data_xfer_size`` value; this defines the maximum data that
+may be read or written via one of the ``VFIO_USER_DMA/REGION_READ/WRITE``
+messages; see `Read and Write Operations`_.
+
+Protocol Specification
+======================
+
+To distinguish from the base VFIO symbols, all vfio-user symbols are prefixed
+with ``vfio_user`` or ``VFIO_USER``. In this revision, all data is in the
+endianness of the host system, although this may be relaxed in future
+revisions in cases where the client and server run on different hosts
+with different endianness.
+
+Unless otherwise specified, all sizes should be presumed to be in bytes.

+Header
+------
+
+All messages, both command messages and reply messages, are preceded by a
+16-byte header that contains basic information about the message. The header is
+followed by message-specific data described in the sections below.

++----------------+--------+-------------+
+| <message data> | 16     | variable    |
++----------------+--------+-------------+
+
+* *Message ID* identifies the message, and is echoed in the command's reply
+  message. Message IDs belong entirely to the sender, can be re-used (even
+  concurrently) and the receiver must not make any assumptions about their
+  uniqueness.
+* *Command* specifies the command to be executed, listed in Commands_. It is
+  also set in the reply header.
+* *Message size* contains the size of the entire message, including the header.
+* *Flags* contains attributes of the message:
+
+  * The *Type* bits indicate the message type.
+
+    *  *Command* (value 0x0) indicates a command message.
+    *  *Reply* (value 0x1) indicates a reply message acknowledging a previous
+       command with the same message ID.
+  * *No_reply* in a command message indicates that no reply is needed for this
+    command.  This is commonly used when multiple commands are sent, and only
+    the last needs acknowledgement.
+  * *Error* in a reply message indicates the command being acknowledged had
+    an error. In this case, the *Error* field will be valid.
+
+* *Error* in a reply message is an optional UNIX errno value. It may be zero
+  even if the Error bit is set in Flags. It is reserved in a command message.
+
+Each command message in Commands_ must be replied to with a reply message,
+unless the message sets the *No_Reply* bit.  The reply consists of the header
+with the *Reply* bit set, plus any additional data.
+
+If an error occurs, the reply message must only include the reply header.
+
+As the header is standard in both requests and replies, it is not included in
+the command-specific specifications below; each message definition should be
+appended to the standard header, and the offsets are given from the end of the
+standard header.
+
+``VFIO_USER_VERSION``
+---------------------
+
+.. _Version:
+
+This is the initial message sent by the client after the socket connection is
+established; the same format is used for the server's reply.
+
+Upon establishing a connection, the client must send a ``VFIO_USER_VERSION``
+message proposing a protocol version and a set of capabilities. The server
+compares these with the versions and capabilities it supports and sends a
+``VFIO_USER_VERSION`` reply according to the following rules.
+
+* The major version in the reply must be the same as proposed. If the client
+  does not support the proposed major, it closes the connection.
+* The minor version in the reply must be equal to or less than the minor
+  version proposed.
+* The capability list must be a subset of those proposed. If the server
+  requires a capability the client did not include, it closes the connection.
+
+The protocol major version will only change when incompatible protocol changes
+are made, such as changing the message format. The minor version may change
+when compatible changes are made, such as adding new messages or capabilities,
+Both the client and server must support all minor versions less than the
+maximum minor version it supports. E.g., an implementation that supports
+version 1.3 must also support 1.0 through 1.2.
+
+When making a change to this specification, the protocol version number must
+be included in the form "added in version X.Y"

+handshake is completed, but may also occur when memory is added to the client,

+Request

+

++-------------+--------+-------------+
+
+* *argsz* is the size of the above structure. Note there is no reply payload,
+  so this field differs from other message types.
+* *flags* contains the following region attributes:
+
+  * *readable* indicates that the region can be read from.
+
+  * *writeable* indicates that the region can be written to.
+
+* *offset* is the file offset of the region with respect to the associated file
+  descriptor, or zero if the region is not mappable
+* *address* is the base DMA address of the region.
+* *size* is the size of the region.
+
+This structure is 32 bytes in size, so the message size is 16 + 32 bytes.
+
+If the DMA region being added can be directly mapped by the server, a file
+descriptor must be sent as part of the message meta-data. The region can be
+mapped via the mmap() system call. On ``AF_UNIX`` sockets, the file descriptor
+must be passed as ``SCM_RIGHTS`` type ancillary data.  Otherwise, if the DMA
+region cannot be directly mapped by the server, no file descriptor must be sent
+as part of the message meta-data and the DMA region can be accessed by the
+server using ``VFIO_USER_DMA_READ`` and ``VFIO_USER_DMA_WRITE`` messages,
+explained in `Read and Write Operations`_. A command to map over an existing
+region must be failed by the server with ``EEXIST`` set in error field in the
+reply.

+There is no payload in the reply message.
+
+``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP``
+-----------------------
+
+This command message is sent by the client to the server to inform it that a
+DMA region, previously made available via a ``VFIO_USER_DMA_MAP`` command
+message, is no longer available for DMA. It typically occurs when memory is
+subtracted from the client or if the client uses a vIOMMU. The DMA region is

+Upon receiving a ``VFIO_USER_DMA_UNMAP`` command, if the file descriptor is
+mapped then the server must release all references to that DMA region before
+replying, which potentially includes in-flight DMA transactions.

+``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS``
+--------------------------------------
+
+Clients can access regions via ``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ/WRITE`` or, if provided, by
+``mmap()`` of a file descriptor provided by the server.
+
+``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_GET_REGION_IO_FDS`` provides an alternative access mechanism via
+file descriptors. This is an optional feature intended for performance
+improvements where an underlying sub-system (such as KVM) supports communication
+across such file descriptors to the vfio-user server, without needing to
+round-trip through the client.
+
+The server returns an array of sub-regions for the requested region. Each
+sub-region describes a span (offset and size) of a region, along with the
+requested file descriptor notification mechanism to use.  Each sub-region in the
+response message may choose to use a different method, as defined below.  The
+two mechanisms supported in this specification are ioeventfds and ioregionfds.
+
+The server in addition returns a file descriptor in the ancillary data; clients
+are expected to configure each sub-region's file descriptor with the requested
+notification method. For example, a client could configure KVM with the
+requested ioeventfd via a ``KVM_IOEVENTFD`` ``ioctl()``.

+``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQS``
+-----------------------------
+
+This command message is sent by the client to the server to set actions for
+device interrupt types. The VFIO IRQ set structure is defined in

++-------+--------+------------------------------+
+
+* *argsz* is the size of the VFIO IRQ set request payload, including any *data*
+  field. Note there is no reply payload, so this field differs from other
+  message types.
+* *flags* defines the action performed on the interrupt range. The ``DATA``
+  flags describe the data field sent in the message; the ``ACTION`` flags
+  describe the action to be performed. The flags are mutually exclusive for
+  both sets.
+
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` indicates there is no data field in the command.
+    The action is performed unconditionally.
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` indicates the data field is an array of boolean
+    bytes. The action is performed if the corresponding boolean is true.
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` indicates an array of event file descriptors
+    was sent in the message meta-data. These descriptors will be signalled when
+    the action defined by the action flags occurs. In ``AF_UNIX`` sockets, the
+    descriptors are sent as ``SCM_RIGHTS`` type ancillary data.
+    If no file descriptors are provided, this de-assigns the specified
+    previously configured interrupts.
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK`` indicates a masking event. It can be used with
+    ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to mask an interrupt,
+    or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the guest masks
+    the interrupt.
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_UNMASK`` indicates an unmasking event. It can be used
+    with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to unmask an
+    interrupt, or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the
+    guest unmasks the interrupt.
+  * ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER`` indicates a triggering event. It can be used
+    with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` or ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` to trigger an
+    interrupt, or with ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD`` to generate an event when the
+    server triggers the interrupt.
+
+* *index* is the index of IRQ type being setup.
+* *start* is the start of the sub-index being set.
+* *count* describes the number of sub-indexes being set. As a special case, a
+  count (and start) of 0, with data flags of ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE`` disables
+  all interrupts of the index.
+* *data* is an optional field included when the
+  ``VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_BOOL`` flag is present. It contains an array of booleans
+  that specify whether the action is to be performed on the corresponding
+  index. It's used when the action is only performed on a subset of the range
+  specified.
+
+Not all interrupt types support every combination of data and action flags.
+The client must know the capabilities of the device and IRQ index before it
+sends a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message.
+
+In typical operation, a specific IRQ may operate as follows:
+
+1. The client sends a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
+   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER)`` along
+   with an eventfd. This associates the IRQ with a particular eventfd on the
+   server side.
+
+#. The client may send a ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
+   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_EVENTFD|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK/UNMASK)`` along
+   with another eventfd. This associates the given eventfd with the
+   mask/unmask state on the server side.
+
+#. The server may trigger the IRQ by writing 1 to the eventfd.
+
+#. The server may mask/unmask an IRQ which will write 1 to the corresponding
+   mask/unmask eventfd, if there is one.
+
+5. A client may trigger a device IRQ itself, by sending a
+   ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
+   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE/BOOL|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_TRIGGER)``.
+
+6. A client may mask or unmask the IRQ, by sending a
+   ``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_SET_IRQ`` message with
+   ``flags=(VFIO_IRQ_SET_DATA_NONE/BOOL|VFIO_IRQ_SET_ACTION_MASK/UNMASK)``.
+
+Reply
+^^^^^
+
+There is no payload in the reply.
+
+.. _Read and Write Operations:
+
+Note that all of these operations must be supported by the client and/or server,
+even if the corresponding memory or device region has been shared as mappable.
+
+The ``count`` field must not exceed the value of ``max_data_xfer_size`` of the
+peer, for both reads and writes.
+
+``VFIO_USER_REGION_READ``
+-------------------------
+
+If a device region is not mappable, it's not directly accessible by the client
+via ``mmap()`` of the underlying file descriptor. In this case, a client can
+read from a device region with this message.

+``VFIO_USER_DEVICE_RESET``
+--------------------------
+
+This command message is sent from the client to the server to reset the device.
+Neither the request or reply have a payload.
+
+
+Appendices
+==========
+
+Unused VFIO ``ioctl()`` commands
+--------------------------------
+
+The following VFIO commands do not have an equivalent vfio-user command:
+
+* ``VFIO_GET_API_VERSION``
+* ``VFIO_CHECK_EXTENSION``
+* ``VFIO_SET_IOMMU``
+* ``VFIO_GROUP_GET_STATUS``
+* ``VFIO_GROUP_SET_CONTAINER``
+* ``VFIO_GROUP_UNSET_CONTAINER``
+* ``VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD``
+* ``VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO``
+
+However, once support for live migration for VFIO devices is finalized some
+of the above commands may have to be handled by the client in their
+corresponding vfio-user form. This will be addressed in a future protocol
+version.
+
+VFIO groups and containers
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The current VFIO implementation includes group and container idioms that
+describe how a device relates to the host IOMMU. In the vfio-user
+implementation, the IOMMU is implemented in SW by the client, and is not
+visible to the server. The simplest idea would be that the client put each
+device into its own group and container.
+
+Backend Program Conventions
+---------------------------
+
+vfio-user backend program conventions are based on the vhost-user ones.
+
+* The backend program must not daemonize itself.
+* No assumptions must be made as to what access the backend program has on the
+  system.
+* File descriptors 0, 1 and 2 must exist, must have regular
+  stdin/stdout/stderr semantics, and can be redirected.
+* The backend program must honor the SIGTERM signal.
+* The backend program must accept the following commands line options:
+
+  * ``--socket-path=PATH``: path to UNIX domain socket,
+  * ``--fd=FDNUM``: file descriptor for UNIX domain socket, incompatible with
+    ``--socket-path``
+* The backend program must be accompanied with a JSON file stored under
+  ``/usr/share/vfio-user``.
+
+TODO add schema similar to docs/interop/vhost-user.json.
