I think that (apart from docs/devel) the ideal would be that a
user should be able to look at the documentation to find what
they need to know and not have to look in the wiki. So "feature X
is unsupported" is useful to have in the documentation; developer
TODO lists, design notes, suggestions for improvements, etc
would be better on the wiki.

If we don't think they're liable to become rapidly out of date,
I guess we might as well err on the side of providing information
that's helpful to users. (I think a full-on "here is a tutorial
and how-to guide on setting up guest OS Foo on this model"
would perhaps be a bit out of place, but there's lots of space
between here and there.)
