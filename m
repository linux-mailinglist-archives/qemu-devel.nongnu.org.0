Title:
  Single-step exceptions incorrectly routed to EL1 when ELD is EL2 (TDE
  =3D 1) (qemu version 3.1)

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I've been encountering issues with QEMU 3.1 when trying to single-step
  EL1 code, with ELD =3D EL2 (MDCR_EL2.TDE =3D 1). I could test with latest
  commit in a few hours, if you want.

  EL1 is Aarch64.

  This happens as soon as MDSCR_EL1.SS is set to 1 and ERET is executed:

  - Single-step exceptions are routed to EL1

  Exception return from AArch64 EL2 to AArch64 EL1 PC 0x4000005c
  Taking exception 1 [Undefined Instruction]
  ...from EL1 to EL1
  ...with ESR 0x32/0xca000022
  ...with ELR 0x4000005c
  ...to EL1 PC 0x200 PSTATE 0x3c5

  EC 0x32 (0b110010) is Exception_SoftwareStepLowerEl.

  You can find enclosed minimal code (and resulting .elf) for
  reproduction.
