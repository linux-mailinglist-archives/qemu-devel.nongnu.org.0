Hm, right. So we're using includes for two different purposes, but just
from looking at the include line, you can't know which one it is.

Possibly. However, while it would be an improvement generally speaking,
how does this change the specific problem? All of the smaller files will
be included by block.json (or whatever file provides the "Block devices"
chapter in the documentation) and at least one of them will still have
to include job.json.

(As it happens, the block export series splits off a block-export QAPI
module, but it's probably small enough to be barely noticable in this
comparison.)
