I have tried:

             thread_cpu =3D NULL;
+            object_unparent(OBJECT(cpu));
+            object_property_set_bool(OBJECT(cpu), false, "realized", NULL);
             object_unref(OBJECT(cpu));

but it didn't manifestly change anything (i.e. both with and without
setting realized the thread allocated stuff is freed). Valgrind still
complains about:

But I don't know if that is just because the final exit_group of the
main CPU just exits without attempting to clean-up. However it is better
than it was.

Title:
  Qemu-ppc Memory leak creating threads

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  When creating c++ threads (with c++ std::thread), the resulting binary
  has memory leaks when running with qemu-ppc.

  Eg the following c++ program, when compiled with gcc, consumes more
  and more memory while running at qemu-ppc. (does not have memory leaks
  when compiling for Intel, when running same binary on real powerpc CPU
  hardware also no memory leaks).

  (Note I used function getCurrentRSS to show available memory, see
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/669438/how-to-get-memory-usage-at-
  runtime-using-c; calls commented out here)

  Compiler: powerpc-linux-gnu-g++ (Debian 8.3.0-2) 8.3.0 (but same problem =
with older g++ compilers even 4.9)
  Os: Debian 10.0 ( Buster) (but same problem seen on Debian 9/stetch)
  qemu: qemu-ppc version 3.1.50

  using namespace std::chrono_literals;

  // Create/run and join a 100 threads.
  void Fun100()
  {
  //    auto b4 =3D getCurrentRSS();
  //    std::cout << getCurrentRSS() << std::endl;
      for(int n =3D 0; n < 100; n++)
      {
          std::thread t([]
          {
              std::this_thread::sleep_for( 10ms );
          });
  //        std::cout << n << ' ' << getCurrentRSS() << std::endl;

      }

 memory...
