Yes, searching for datasheets for the southbridge chips containing this 
IDE controller such as VT82C686B and VT8231 might turn up something but 
the docs are not too detailed regarding IRQ mapping. Switching between 
modes is done the same way as on CMD646 via bits of the PROG_IF config reg 
but as it's also noted in Linux fixup func the firmware on pegasos2 does 
set it up as native mode and also writes to the interrupt line reg to set 
it to 9, yet it seems to remain set to 14 (this is confirmed by reg dump 
from Linux on real hardware) and IRQs are expected on 14 and 15 as in 
legacy mode (shown by expectation of Amiga like OSes, regardless of what's 
in config regs). Docs say that in legacy mode io addresses should be 
legacy io ports assigned to IDE, yet firmware and OSes use PCI BARs as in 
native mode but expect interrupts on legacy IRQ as in legacy mode so I 
think it's kind of half-native mode.

This is what the log shows on real PegasosII (using Debian 5 because later 
versions seems to have problems with radeon driver so have no display):

If this was legacy mode io ports should not be what seem to be coming from 
PCI BARs so either docs are not correct about how legacy mode works or 
this is not legacy mode but "not 100% native mode". The prog-if is set to 
0x8a which corresponds to native mode but this is what the Linux fixup 
function does, firmware sets it to 0x8f which means native mode.
