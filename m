Yes (wehther it fails or prints a warning depends on how significant the
capability is; if it's a guest crash then fail is probably best).

 it=E2=80=99s .needed() method will return false in case the property is =

Property values are initialised from the machine type; in your case
where you want to upgrade to use a new feature then you can use
(3) to change it.

 i.e. We will modify migration/vmstate.c to not even call .needed() metho=
d of such subsection.

I still don't like exposing a list of migration subsections into an
interface.
