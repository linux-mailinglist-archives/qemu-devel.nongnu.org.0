What would be the right mode of rejecting it?

I assume we should catch it somewhere in the QAPI generator (where?) and
then just assert in the C code that both flags aren't set at the same
time?

This requires Python 3.6, unfortunately. The minimum requirement for
building QEMU is 3.5.

I think it's a first time that I'm asked not to document things, but
I'll remove them.
