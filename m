Michael, you can also refer to this VMware time-keeping whitepaper:=20
https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vmware_timekeeping.pdf.
According to section "Initializing and Correcting Wall-Clock Time":
"""
VMware Tools can also optionally be used to correct long=E2=80=90term dri=
ft and=20
errors by periodically
resynchronizing the virtual machine=E2=80=99s clock to the host=E2=80=99s=
 clock, but the=20
current version at this writing is limited.
In particular, in guest operating systems other than NetWare, it does=20
not correct errors in which the guest clock
is ahead of real time, only those in which the guest clock is behind.

"""

If I understand correctly, this seems to validate my assumption that=20
current implementation for CMD_GETTIME is sufficient.
