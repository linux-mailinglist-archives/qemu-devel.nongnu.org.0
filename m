That's just how preallocation works. If you don't want that, you need
preallocation=3Doff.

Basically, yes. If we had this, we could have a type of cluster where
writing to it still involves a metadata update (to clear the zero flag),
but never copy-on-write, even for partial writes.

I'm not sure if this would cover a very relevant case, though.

Hmm... It feels risky to me.

Yes, you're right. If nothing else comes up, I'll fix this while
applying.
