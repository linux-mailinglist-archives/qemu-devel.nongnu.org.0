Cc'ing John Snow who looks at qmp/qapi too right now.

I've tried to not change qemu behavior, but there are limits to this as
modularization brings some new constellations.

Yep.  Specifically the CONFIG_SPICE=y and spice modules not installed at
runtime is problematic I think.

Well, everything which involves qom objects should work just fine, even
with modules.  You can see objects supported by qemu via qapi
introspection, and that should work just fine with objects being
implemented in modules.

For -audiodev and -display we could turn stuff into objects (simliar to
-chardev) and just use the object class registry instead of having a
private registry.  That would make things also visible in qom
introspection.

The spice problem has been discussed in the past, but IIRC we didn't end
up with a plan.  We could have spice register a dummy qom object
(say 'feature-spice').  Not sure this is a good idea though.

take care,
  Gerd
