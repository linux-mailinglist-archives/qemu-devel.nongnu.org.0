Cc'ing Julia (can't find her on Launchpad) because this looks
similar to a bug she has been tracking.

Title:
  PCI host bridge should ignore 1- and 2-byte I/O accesses

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  In PCI there are two IO modes. Deprecated Mode2 that uses single byte IO =
and Mode1 that uses 4byte IO.
  According to the spec a host bridge that supports Mode1 should ignore all=
 IO that is not 4bytes.

  > Anytime a host bridge sees a full DWORD I/O write from the host to
  > CONFIG_ADDRESS, the bridge must latch the data into its CONFIG_ADDRESS
  > register. On full DWORD I/O reads to CONFIG_ADDRESS, the bridge must re=

  In qemu the host bridge will accept 1-, 2-, and 4-byte reads/writes.
  That breakes plan9 guests that do not use the bios to access the PCI
  config space.

  have a look at:
  http://code.google.com/p/plan9front/source/browse/sys/src/9/pc/pci.c

  In Lines 960-967 the check for PCI Mode1 is done. This check assumes that=
 the 4-byte write at line 961 succeeds and the single byte write at 962 is =
ignored.
  On qemu line 962 will not be ignored and the test in line 963 will fail.
  The plan9 kernel will fall back to Mode2 which does not work.
  The result is that the guest will not see any PCI devices.

  I do not really have an image that you guys could quickly check this with=
, but i could prepare one if need be.
  An easy way to reproduce this in linux would be to stick an outb between =
those two lines from pci_check_type1(void).

  > outl(0x80000000, 0xCF8);
  + outb0x01, 0xcfb);
  > if (inl(0xCF8) =3D=3D 0x80000000 && pci_sanity_check(&pci_direct_conf1)=
) {

  I did not try this but i guess on real hardware the linux kernel would
  still work while it would not work anymore on qemu.

  I tried to come up with a patch but did not find a quick solution. I
  found that in hw/piic_pci.c sysbus_add_io is used which will register
  read/write functions for 1, 2, and 4 bytes. This is done in ioport.c
  ioport_register. I guess if i provided a patch you guys might not like
  it :). So i figured i should report the bug, let me know if you need
  any additional information.
