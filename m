An accurate cpu topology may help improve the cpu scheduler's decision
making when dealing with multi-core system. So cpu topology description
is helpful to provide guest with the right view. Cpu cache information may
also have slight impact on the sched domain, and even userspace software
may check the cpu cache information to do some optimizations. Dario Faggioli's
talk in [0] also shows the virtual topology may has impact on sched performace.
Thus this patch series is posted to provide cpu and cache topology support
for arm platform.

Both fdt and ACPI are introduced to present the cpu and cache topology.
To describe the cpu topology via ACPI, a PPTT table is introduced according
to the processor hierarchy node structure. To describe the cpu cache
information, a default cache hierarchy is given and built according to the
cache type structure defined by ACPI, it can be made configurable later.

The RFC v1 was posted at [1], we tried to map the MPIDR register into cpu
topology, however it is totally wrong. Andrew points it out that Linux kernel
is goint to stop using MPIDR for topology information [2]. The root cause is
the MPIDR register has been abused by ARM OEM manufactures. It is only used as
an identifer for a specific cpu, not representation of the topology. Moreover
this v2 is rebased on Andrew's latest branch shared [4].

This patch series was initially based on the patches posted by Andrew Jones [3].
I jumped in on it since some OS vendor cooperative partner are eager for it.
Thanks for Andrew's contribution.

After applying this patch series, launch a guest with virt-5.3 and cpu
topology configured with sockets:cores:threads = 2:4:2, you will get the
bellow messages with the lscpu command.
