Keeping FDs open across re-exec is a nice trick, but how are you dealing
with the state associated with them, most especially the TLS encryption
state ? AFAIK, there's no way to serialize/deserialize the TLS state that
GNUTLS maintains, and the patches don't show any sign of dealing with
this. IOW it looks like while the FD will be preserved, any TLS session
running on it will fail.

I'm going to presume that you're probably just considering the TLS features
out of scope for your patch series.  It would be useful if you have any
info about this and other things you've considered out of scope for this
patch series.

I'm not seeing anything in the block layer about preserving open FDs, so
I presume you're just letting the block layer close and then re-open any
FDs it has ?  This would have the side effect that any locks held on the
FDs are lost, so there's a potential race condition where another process
could acquire the lock and prevent the re-exec completing. That said this
is unavoidable, because Linux kernel is completely broken wrt keeping
fnctl() locks held across a re-exec, always throwing away the locks if
more than 1 thread is running [1].

Daniel
