it's not only x86, it's for all machines that support numa
hence numa-mem-supported was introduced to make it easier for libvirt
to figure out when to use which syntax.

The plan was to release libvirt with support for numa-mem-supported and
then when newer QEMU forbids 'mem=' it change will be transparent for
relatively fresh livirt.

Whether it still does make sense though.

We could go with your suggestion in which case libvirt unilaterally
switches to using only 'memdev' for 5.0 machine types and then later
(5.1..) we release QEMU that enforces it.
In this case we can axe numa-mem-supported (I'd volunteer) to avoid
supporting yet another ABI/smart logic where your way could be sufficient.

Daniel,
what's your take on Michal's approach?
