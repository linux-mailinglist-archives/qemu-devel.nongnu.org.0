Maybe it wasn't clear from my previous messages, but open-vm-tools is an 
official VMware open-source project...
VMX is the official name of the VMware Userspace-VMM and VMX-Type is an 
official name as-well.

I'm also not copying code here... I'm copying definitions from relevant 
header files to implement a compatible interface.
This is no different than copying constants from a Linux device driver 
to implement it's device emulation in QEMU.

I think I have made it the most easiest to research. Having exactly same 
names as VMware official project and pointing to it directly from 
comments and commit messages.

What do you mean "unrelated"? It's an official VMware open-source 
project for VMware Tools...
I'm only copying definition of constants...

Right. That's why I think the enum PropertyInfo mechanism is an overkill 
at this point.

These are all official names. I'm not sure I understand what you are 
suggesting.
