Perfect timing: right before I drop off for two weeks of vacation.  I'm

Have you run it through our CI?

Is it faster in common build scenarios?

Not a particularly high bar to cross: our Makefiles are full of the kind
of black magic that keeps simple things simple (which is quite an
achievement; kudos!), and makes not-so-simple things really hard.

I think it's now time to plan the end game, preferably without even more
weeks of intense rebasing.

Do we have consensus to move forward with Meson?  If yes, I'd like to
propose to aim for merging as early as practical in the 5.2 cycle.
Rationale: rebasing build system changes on top of the Meson work is
probably easier than rebasing the Meson work, and avoids turning Paolo
into an overworked bottleneck.

In more detail:

1. Pick a tentative deadline.

2. Cover the testing gaps and get as much review as we can until then.
   Fix defects as we go.

3. If the known defects are expected to disrupt others too much, goto 1.
   Do not worry about unknown defects at this point.

4. Merge.

5. Deal with the fallout.

Opinions?

The major drawback with generating code is usually having to debug the
generated code.  Your experience of not having to do that is
encouraging.
