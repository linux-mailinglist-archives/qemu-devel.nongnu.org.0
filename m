Current state in QEMU is that for ACPI hotplug, it doesn't have to do anyth=
ing
"acpi-pci-hotplug-with-bridge-support=3Don" by default and it's global sett=
ing for
coldplugged bridges, also it (sort of) overrides SHPC (even if was enabled =
with
'shpc=3Don' on a concrete coldplugged bridge).
(I wouldn't be surprised if mixing modes actually isn't functional)

Then there is hotplugged bridges (added at -S time or at runtime), for thos=
e
mgmt has to set 'shpc=3Don' explicitly to be able to hotplug devices into i=
t.
(so mgmt has to know that it's dealing wants SHPC and I suppose it can be t=
aught
that SHPC doesn't support mixed hotplug policy on slots/devices attached to=
 it).
Whether mgmt actually does something with shpc or not, I have no slightest =
idea.
(CCing Laine, perhaps he can clarify if we should care about SHPC here)
