Ok, I can understand that. I've been thinking about how we can switch
libvirt to use meson too, and trying to decide between meson being the
owner, calling out to make  vs keeping make as the owner and calling
out to meson. Ultimately to entirely banish make, autoconf, automake,
libtool, m4 & shell from our build system :-)

Despite thinking about an incremental conversion though, I was still
hoping libvirt would just have a single (largish) patch series to
do a complete conversion at a specific point in time.

Ok, I think it understand the motiviation better now that its obviously
just a short term expedient step to convert ninja to make.
