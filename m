OK, I'll try to post a v6 before the weekend, unless you prefer that I
hold off until you've reviewed the whole series.

Yes, tests are definitely on my radar. I'm working on SPI flash
qtests. I haven't had much success with avocado yet, but I'll keep
trying (perhaps using docker to control the environment more tightly).

Since the 5.1 release is frozen now, I might post some followup
patches before this series is merged, e.g. tests, bootrom
submodule+blob, more peripherals, etc. Is it preferable to keep this
series frozen (modulo API updates) since you spent a lot of time
reviewing it, and post the new stuff separately, or is it better to
add new patches to the end of the series and resend the whole thing?

> But these are apparently not stable links (expire after 30 days?).

Sorry, I'm too ignorant about Jenkins to know. I'll see if I can
figure something out.
