* No, we can not release/share reproducers on a public list.

* We can request reporters to do so by their volition.

| Also, why are we assigning CVEs for bugs we don't consider security bugs?

* We need to mark these componets 'out of security scope' at the source level, 
  rather than on each bug.

* Easiest could be to just have a list of such components in the git text 
  file. At least till the time we device --security build and run time option 
  discussed earlier.

| Indeed. Posting puzzles is a negative-sum game.]

* Agreed. I think the upcoming 'qemu-security' list may help in this regard.  
  As issue reports+reproducer details shall go there.

* Even then, we'll need to ask reporter's permission before sharing their 
  reproducers on a public list OR with non-members.

* Best is if reporters share/release reproducers themselves. Maybe we can have 
  a public git repository and they can send a PR to include their reproducers 
  in the repository.

* That way multiple reproducers for the same issue can be held together.


Thank you.
