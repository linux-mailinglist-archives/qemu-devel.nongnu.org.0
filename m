Some of the constraints on operand sizes have been relaxed, so adjust the
documentation.

Deprecate atomic_mb_read and atomic_mb_set; it is not really possible to
use them correctly because they do not interoperate with sequentially-consi=
stent
RMW operations.

Finally, extend the memory barrier pairing section to cover acquire and
release semantics in general, roughly based on the KVM Forum 2016 talk,
"<atomic.h> weapons".

-You can see that the two possible definitions of ``atomic_mb_read()``

-Memory barrier pairing
-----------------------
-
-A useful rule of thumb is that memory barriers should always, or almost
-always, be paired with another barrier.  In the case of QEMU, however,
-note that the other barrier may actually be in a driver that runs in
-the guest!
-
-For the purposes of pairing, ``smp_read_barrier_depends()`` and ``smp_rmb(=
)``
-both count as read barriers.  A read barrier shall pair with a write
-barrier or a full barrier; a write barrier shall pair with a read
-barrier or a full barrier.  A full barrier can pair with anything.
-For example:

+In this case, correctness is easy to check for using the "pairing"

+Acquire/release pairing and the *synchronizes-with* relation
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Atomic operations other than ``atomic_set()`` and ``atomic_read()`` have
+either *acquire* or *release* semantics [#rmw]_.  This has two effects:
+
+.. [#rmw] Read-modify-write operations can have both---acquire applies to =
the
+          read part, and release to the write.
+
+- within a thread, they are ordered either before subsequent operations
+  (for acquire) or after previous operations (for release).
+
+- if a release operation in one thread *synchronizes with* an acquire oper=
ation
+  in another thread, the ordering constraints propagates from the first to=
 the
+  second thread.  That is, everything before the release operation in the
+  first thread is guaranteed to *happen before* everything after the
+  acquire operation in the second thread.
+
+The concept of acquire and release semantics is not exclusive to atomic
+operations; almost all higher-level synchronization primitives also have
+acquire or release semantics.  For example:
+
+- ``pthread_mutex_lock`` has acquire semantics, ``pthread_mutex_unlock`` h=
as
+  release semantics and synchronizes with a ``pthread_mutex_lock`` for the
+  same mutex.
+
+- ``pthread_cond_signal`` and ``pthread_cond_broadcast`` have release sema=
ntics;
+  ``pthread_cond_wait`` has both release semantics (synchronizing with
+  ``pthread_mutex_lock``) and acquire semantics (synchronizing with
+  ``pthread_mutex_unlock`` and signaling of the condition variable).
+
+- ``pthread_create`` has release semantics and synchronizes with the start
+  of the new thread; ``pthread_join`` has acquire semantics and synchroniz=
es
+  with the exiting of the thread.
+
+- ``qemu_event_set`` has release semantics, ``qemu_event_wait`` has
+  acquire semantics.
+
+For example, in the following example there are no atomic accesses, but st=
ill
+thread 2 is relying on the *synchronizes-with* relation between ``pthread_=
exit``
+(release) and ``pthread_join`` (acquire):

+
+Synchronization between threads basically descends from this pairing of
+a release operation and an acquire operation.  Therefore, atomic operation=
s
+other than ``atomic_set()`` and ``atomic_read()`` will almost always be
+paired with another operation of the opposite kind: an acquire operation
+will pair with a release operation and vice versa.  This rule of thumb is
+extremely useful; in the case of QEMU, however, note that the other
+operation may actually be in a driver that runs in the guest!
+
+``smp_read_barrier_depends()``, ``smp_rmb()``, ``smp_mb_acquire()``,
+``atomic_load_acquire()`` and ``atomic_rcu_read()`` all count
+as acquire operations.  ``smp_wmb()``, ``smp_mb_release()``,
+``atomic_store_release()`` and ``atomic_rcu_set()`` all count as release
+operations.  ``smp_mb()`` counts as both acquire and release, therefore
+it can pair with any other atomic operation.  Here is an example:

 Note that the "writing" thread is accessing the variables in the
 opposite order as the "reading" thread.  This is expected: stores
-before the write barrier will normally match the loads after the
-read barrier, and vice versa.  The same is true for more than 2
-access and for data dependency barriers:
+before a release operation will normally match the loads after
+the acquire operation, and vice versa.  In fact, this happened already
+in the ``pthread_exit``/``pthread_join`` example above.
+
+Finally, this more complex example has more than two accesses and data
+dependency barriers.  It also does not use atomic accesses whenever there
+cannot be a data race:
