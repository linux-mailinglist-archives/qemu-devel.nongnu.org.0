When I look at our current huge list of containers, I wonder how do we know 
which containers still get used (in the sense of not only build), and which 
ones are likely already bit-rotten? And why do we need that many containers? 
Why both, debian-arm64-test-cross.docker and debian-arm64-cross.docker and 
not combine them? And why do we need that many individual cross-compiler 
docker files if we already have debian-all-test-cross.docker that can be 
used to test most of them? ... for me, as a docker ignorant, this is all 
very opaque and some clean up IMHO could really help here.

Do you really use the docker files from the gitlab registry? I'd rather 
expected that people build those locally in case they need them...?

Well, I guess manual mode is fine, too, as long as they don't waste CPU 
cycles and network bandwidth anymore for most people who don't need them.
