Request sizes are limited to 32 bit in the generic block layer before
they are even passed to the individual block drivers, so most if not all
of these are going to be false positives.

But if you look at the code we're talking about, you see that it's
complaining about things where being more explicit would make things
less readable.

For example, if complains about the multiplication in this line:

    s->file_size +=3D n * s->header.cluster_size;

We know that n * s->header.cluster_size fits in 32 bits, but
s->file_size is 64 bits (and has to be 64 bits). Do you really think we
should introduce another uint32_t variable to store the intermediate
result? And if we cast n to uint64_t, not only might the multiplication
cost more time, but also human readers would wonder why the result could
become larger than 32 bits. So a cast would be misleading.


It also complains about this line:

    ret =3D bdrv_truncate(bs->file, (3 + l1_clusters) * s->cluster_size,
                        PREALLOC_MODE_OFF, &local_err);

Here, we don't even assign the result to a 64 bit variable, but just
pass it to a function which takes a 64 bit parameter. Again, I don't
think introducing additional variables for the intermediate result or
adding casts would be an improvement of the situation.


So I don't think this is a good enough tool to base our code on what it
does and doesn't understand. It would have too much of a negative impact
on our code. We'd rather need a way to mark false positives as such and
move on without changing the code in such cases.
