 Hi Peter,

without the fix, certain boot scenarios break:

- "-boot menu=3Don" does not work anymore.

- It's not possible anymore to specify the s390x-specific "loadparm"
  option (can be used e.g. with "-machine s390-ccw-virtio,loadparm=3Dxyz")
  This is e.g. important for booting alternate kernel that are installed
  on the guest's hard disk image.

The fix is just a one-liner, has been reviewed and tested by multiple
people already, so it should not cause any other regressions.

I think you could merge it also without doing another RC next week - the
people who care about s390x on the list already have checked the fix, so
we won't get too much additional testing coverage if you release yet
another RC before the final release.

 Thomas
