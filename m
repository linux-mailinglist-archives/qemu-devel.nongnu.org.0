Ease of use.

If it makes someone's life easier, and is not hard to maintain, then 
yes.  A command line interface that calls into QMP is not hard to 
maintain.  And _I_ certainly found it easier to write iotests with this 
patch in place, so it already has at least one client.

This _IS_ such a wrapper.  The whole point of this patch is that it is 
now simpler to run one (or more) QMP command on an offline image from 
the command line.  Just because I wrote it in C instead of python, and 
attached it to an existing tool instead of writing a new tool, doesn't 
change the fact that it is just a wrapper around the existing QMP commands.
