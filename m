This is something that bothered me for a while now. Even though it's not
as bad as it used to be because we are not adding so much wrappers for
monitor commands as we used to. I mean, in libvirt the wrapper for a
monitor command has to be written by hand. Worse, whenever I'm adding a
wrapper I look at the QMP schema of it and let my muscle memory write
the wrapper.

However, it's not only what Markus already mentioned. Even if we
generated wrappers by a script, we need to be able to generate wrappers
for every single supported version of qemu.

For instance, if qemu version X has a command that accepts some set of
arguments and this set changes in version X+1 then libvirt needs both
wrappers and decides at runtime (depending on what version it is talking
to) what wrapper to use.

Unfortunately, I don't see any easy way out.
