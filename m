Yes, this is working now.

I strongly disagree with this. This absolutist position is why we
have made zero progress in 10+ years, leaving mgmt apps suffering
with HMP passthrough, as described above. 

This is a prime example of perfect being the enemy of good.

We should make a credible attempt at QMP design, but if perfection
isn't practical, we should none the less do *something* in QMP, even
if we find we need to deprecate & replace it later.

The things I'm trying to accomplish as listed in the text above.
Primarily this is about fixing the ability to snapshot guests where
QEMU's heuristics for picking block devices is broken. ie explicitly
list the disks to snapshot and which to store vmstate in.

Converting from HMP to QMP is esentially an enabler, because adding
new args to existing savevm/loadvm HMP commands is just too horrible
to contemplate, as mgmt apps have no sane way to probe HMP. That's
what QMP is for.

Essentially the goal is to fix the inability to use internal snapshots
with UEFI based VMs that is causing immediate pain for mgmt apps due
to increased need to support UEFI.

From the POV of practicality, making a design that unifies internal
and external snapshots is something I'm considering out of scope.
It increases the design time burden, as well as implementation burden.
On my side, improving internal snapshots is a "spare time" project,
not something I can justify spending weeks or months on.

My goal is to implement something that is achievable in a short
amount of time that gets us out of the hole we've been in for 10
years. Minimal refactoring of the internal snapshot code aside
from fixing the critical limitations we have today around choice
of disks to snapshot.

If someone later wants to come up with a grand unified design
for everything that's fine, we can deprecate the new QMP commands
I'm proposing now.

The intent is for the QMP commands to operate exclusively on
'tags', and never consider "ID".
