Yes. I think so too.

Here are the specs :

    https://web.archive.org/web/20120419173345/https://www.power.org/resources/downloads/Power_ePAPR_APPROVED_v1.1.pdf

See 5.4.1 Boot CPU Initial Register State

Register	Value

MSR		PR=0 supervisor state
		EE=0 interrupts disabled
		ME=0 machine check interrupt disabled
		IP=0 interrupt prefix-- low memory
		IR=0,DR=0 real mode (see note 1)
		IS=0,DS=0 address space 0 (see note 1)
		SF=0, CM=0, ICM=0 32-bit mode
		The state of any additional MSR bits is defined in the
		applicable processor supplement specification.
R3		Effective address of the device tree image.
		Note: This address shall be 8 bytes aligned in memory.
R4		0
R5		0
R6		ePAPR magic valueâto distinguish from non-ePAPR-
		compliant firmware
		â¢ For Book III-E CPUs shall be 0x45504150
		â¢ For non-Book III-E CPUs shall be 0x65504150
R7		shall be the size of the boot IMA in bytes
R8		0
R9		0
TCR		WRC=0, no watchdog timer reset will occur (see note 2)
other registers implementation dependent


Thanks,

C.
