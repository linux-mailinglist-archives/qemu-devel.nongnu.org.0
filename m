I also sent a RFC in March and ARM KVM experts were also invoved in the=20
discussion:

https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/kvmarm/2019-March/035026.html

According to the discussion, qemu on x86 is using KVM_KVMCLOCK_CTRL to=20
request KVM to set a flag "PVCLOCK_GUEST_STOPPED" in pvclock, informing=20
VM kernel about external force stop.
