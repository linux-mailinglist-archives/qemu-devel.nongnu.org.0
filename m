Development tools should exempt themselves from QMP's interface

Let me clarify "synchronous" to avoid confusion.

Both QMP and HMP commands are synchronous protocols in the sense that
commands are executed one after the other, without overlap.  When a
client sends multiple commands, it can assume that each one starts only
after the previous one completed.

Both HMP and QMP commands execute synchronously in the sense that the
command runs to completion without ever yielding the thread.  Any
blocking operations put the thread to sleep (but see below).

HMP runs in the main thread.  Putting the main thread to sleep is
generally undesirable.

QMP used to run in the main thread, too.  Nowadays, the QMP core runs in
an I/O thread shared by all monitors, and dispatches commands to the
main thread.  Moving command execution out of the main thread as well
requires careful review of the command's code for hidden assumptions.
Major project.

Fine print: OOB commands are a special case, but I doubt you want to
know more.

Fine print: certain character devices can't support use of an I/O
thread; QMP runs in the main thread then.  The ones you want to use with
QMP all support I/O threads.

You wrote "we kick of safe work which waits until all vCPU threads are
stopped before we go through the records and add up numbers [...] we
just output to the monitor FD".  Does this mean the HMP command kicks
off the work, terminates, and some time later something else prints
results to the monitor?  How much later?

If "later" is actually "soon", for a suitable value of "soon",
Marc-Andr=C3=A9's work on "asynchronous" QMP might be pertinent.  I put
"asynchronous" in scare quotes, because of the confusion it has caused.
My current understanding (Marc-Andr=C3=A9, please correct me if wrong): it
lets QMP commands to block without putting their thread to sleep.  It
does not make QMP an asynchronous protocol.

If "later" need not be "soon", read on.

In QMP, there are two established ways to do potentially long-running
work.  Both ways use a command that kicks off the work, then terminates
without waiting for it to complete.

The first way is traditional: pair the kick off command with a query
command and optionally an event.

When the work completes, it fires off the event.  The event is broadcast
to all QMP monitors (we could implement unicast if we have a compelling
use case).

The query command reports whether the work has completed, and if yes,
the work's results, if any.

You need the event if you want to avoid polling.

Even with an event, you still need a query command.  If your management
application loses its QMP connection temporarily, you can miss the
event.  You want to poll on reconnect, with the query command.

If more than one instance of the work can be pending at any one time,
event and query need to identify the instance somehow.  This is
completely ad hoc.

The second way is a full-blown "job".  This provides more control: you
can cancel, pause, resume, ...  It also provides a job ID.  More
featureful and more structured.

Jobs have grown out of block jobs.  I'd love to see some uses outside
the block subsystem.

Hope this helps!
