Not at all!

Thanks for the patch.

In future if people don't respond you can just keep pinging your patch.

This whole paragraph should not be in the commit. It can go below the
line though.

Also please use `git format-patch` to format the patch and then `git
send-email` to send the patch. There is a whole heap of detail here:

This seems like a similar issue to this patch as well:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20191007052813.25814-1-dayeol@berkeley.edu/

From that discussion:

"In general, size 0 means "unknown size".  In this case, the one tlb lookup is
going to be used by lots of instructions -- everything that fits on the page."

Richard's last comment seems like a better fix:

"You certainly could do

    if (size == 0) {
        size = -(addr | TARGET_PAGE_MASK);
    }

to assume that all bytes from addr to the end of the page are accessed.  That
would avoid changing too much of the rest of the logic.

That said, this code will continue to not work for mis-aligned boundaries."

So I don't think this is the correct solution. I'm not sure if Dayeol
is planning on sending a follow up version. If not feel free to send
it.

It looks like this is a HTML patch, also ensure all patches are just
plain text, `git send-email` will do this.

Thanks for the patch though! Please send any more fixes that you find :)
