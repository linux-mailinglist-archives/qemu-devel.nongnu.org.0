ACK. I do not have time to fix this bug at the moment under the belief
that it's likely low-priority and only "misbehaving guests" can trigger
it. Some advice:

1. Do not use IDE in production deployments after initial installation,
if you can help it. Use a performant virtio solution.

2. If anyone would like to fix this problem, I will be more than happy
to point you to the exact lines of code that cause the problem. I think
the fix will be easy, but testing will be time-consuming as it involves
understanding error behavior of real hardware that I don't personally
have the setup to quickly test or verify.

>From memory: the problem is that ide_dma_cb expects that it was able to
prepare at least one sector's worth of scatter-gather list to begin DMA,
but it's possible to give malformed SG lists where IDE is unable to
process the remainder of a sector in a list.

It was not clear to me at the time when I first investigated this what a
real controller would do if it got an incomplete sector and how it
should signal that.

It was also not clear to me if the sg_prepare function for the pci bmdma
controller would ever encounter a situation where further entries in the
list might be received "later" and we should "wait" for them.

If this bug is more dangerous than a self-inflicted DOS, please let me
know and I'll re-prioritize. Patches, email and IRC chats welcome.
