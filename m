What is your launcher ?  Are you using libvirt, or something else ?

If the goal is simply to make it easy to attach GDB right at the start of
QEMU execution, then could this feature be supported by the launcher itself
in an easier way.

eg, immediately before the execve(qemu, ....) syscall, the launcher can
simply send SIGSTOP to itself.  You can now fire up GDB, attach to it,
and be able to watch execution from the very momement of execve(),
which is even earlier than this patch allows for, and still avoids the
need to follow across forks.

Daniel
