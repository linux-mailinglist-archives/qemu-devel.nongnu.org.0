(Without understanding anything about your tag system...)

Note that during (normal, non-postcopy) migration the consistency can
be a little loose - until the guest starts running; i.e. you can send
a page that's in themiddle of being modified as long as you make sure
you send it again later so that what the guest sees on the destination
when it runs is consistent; i.e. it would be fine to send your tags
separately to your data and allow them to get a little out of sync, as
long as they caught up before the guest ran.

Imagine I had a second mapping; what would it look like; how would I get
and restore the tags?

In terms of migration stream, I guess we have two ways to do this,
either it rides shotgun on the main RAM section pages, transmitting
those few extra bytes whenever we transmit a page, or you have a
separate iteratable device for RAMtags, and it just transmits those.
How you keep the two together is an interesting question.
The shotgun method sounds nasty to avoid putting special cases in the,
already hairy, RAM code.

I guess you want the VMM to do as much tagged checked access as possible
on it's own data structures?

How do things like virtio work where the qemu or kernel is accessing
guest memory for IO?
