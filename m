mdev live migration is completely possible to do but i agree with Dan barrange's comments
from the point of view of openstack integration i dont see calling out to a vender sepecific
tool to be an accpetable
solutions for device compatiablity checking. the sys filesystem
that describs the mdevs that can be created shoudl also
contain the relevent infomation such
taht nova could integrate it via libvirt xml representation or directly retrive the
info from
sysfs.
> > - a src VF in SRIOV can migrate to a target VF in SRIOV,
so vf to vf migration is not possible in the general case as there is no standarised
way to transfer teh device state as part of the siorv specs produced by the pci-sig
as such there is not vender neutral way to support sriov live migration.

well actully that is already too late really. ideally we would want to do this compaiablity
check much sooneer to avoid the migration failing. in an openstack envionment  at least
by the time we invoke libvirt (assuming your using the libvirt driver) to do the migration we have alreaedy
finished schduling the instance to the new host. if if we do the compatiablity check at this point
and it fails then the live migration is aborted and will not be retired. These types of late check lead to a
poor user experince as unless you check the migration detial it basically looks like the migration was ignored
as it start to migrate and then continuge running on the orgininal host.

when using generic pci passhotuhg with openstack, the pci alias is intended to reference a single vendor id/product
id so you will have 1+ alias for each type of device. that allows openstack to schedule based on the availability of a
compatibale device because we track inventories of pci devices and can query that when selecting a host.

if we were to support mdev live migration in the future we would want to take the same declarative approch.
1 interospec the capability of the deivce we manage
2 create inventories of the allocatable devices and there capabilities
3 schdule the instance to a host based on the device-type/capabilities and claim it atomicly to prevent raceces
4 have the lower level hyperviors do addtional validation if need prelive migration.

this proposal seams to be targeting extending step 4 where as ideally we should focuse on providing the info that would
be relevant in set 1 preferably in a vendor neutral way vai a kernel interface like /sys.

this might be useful as we could tag the inventory with the migration version and only might to
devices with  the same version

this would not be useful as the schduler cannot directlly connect to the compute host
and even if it could it would be extreamly slow to do this for 1000s of hosts and potentally
multiple devices per host.

opaque vendor specific stings that higher level orchestros have to pass form host
to host and cant reason about are evil, when allowed they prolifroate and
makes any idea of a vendor nutral abstraction and interoperablity between systems
impossible to reason about. that said there is a way to make it opaue but still useful
to userspace. see below

honestly i would much prefer if the version string was just a semver string.
e.g. {major}.{minor}.{bugfix} 

if you do a driver/frimware update and break compatiablity with an older version bump the
major version.

if you add optional a feature that does not break backwards compatiablity if you migrate
an older instance to the new host then just bump the minor/feature number.

if you have a fix for a bug that does not change the feature set or compatiblity backwards or
forwards then bump the bugfix number

then the check is as simple as 
1.) is the mdev type the same
2.) is the major verion the same
3.) am i going form the same version to same version or same version to newer version

if all 3 are true we can migrate.
e.g. 
2.0.1 -> 2.1.1 (ok same major version and migrating from older feature release to newer feature release)
2.1.1 -> 2.0.1 (not ok same major version and migrating from new feature release to old feature release may be
incompatable)
2.0.0 -> 3.0.0 (not ok chaning major version)
2.0.1 -> 2.0.0 (ok same major and minor version, all bugfixs in the same minor release should be compatibly)

we dont need vendor to rencode the driver name or vendor id and product id in the string. that info is alreay
available both to the device driver and to userspace via /sys already we just need to know if version of
the same mdev are compatiable so a simple semver version string which is well know in the software world
at least is a clean abstration we can reuse.

that is a compute driver fucntion
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/8988316b8c132c9662dea6cf0345975e87ce7344/nova/virt/driver.py#L1261-L1278
that is called in the conductor here

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/8988316b8c132c9662dea6cf0345975e87ce7344/nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py#L360-L364
if the check fails(ignoreing the fact its expensive to do an rpc to the compute host) we raise an excption that
move on to the next host in the alternate host list.

https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/8988316b8c132c9662dea6cf0345975e87ce7344/nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py#L556-L567
by default the alternate host list is 3
https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/config.html#scheduler.max_attempts
so there would be a pretty high likely hood that if we only checked compatiablity at this point it would fail to
migrate. realistically speaking this is too late. we can do a final safty check at this point but this should
not be the first time we check compatibility. at a mimnium we would have wanted to select a host with the same mdev
type first, we can do that from the info we have today but i hope i have made the point that declaritive interfacs
which we can introspect without haveing opaqce vender sepecitic blob are vastly more consomable then imperitive
interfaces we have to probe. form a security and packaging point of view this is better too as if i only need
readonly access to sysfs instead of write access and if i dont need to package a bunch of addtion vendor tools
in a continerised deployment that significantly decreases the potential attack surface.
