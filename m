I agree with you that we should defer my patches which overlap with
the per-cpu-lock patch series.

In order to re-focus the series a bit, we are planning to drop the
annotations from the series.  This allows for a bit more focus on
enabling TSan and less on bringing the warnings to 0 as you mentioned.

At the same time, we're also going to add in a bit more details to
testing.rst on how to use the various suppression mechanisms,
annotations, blacklist and suppressions.txt.

We have been using detect_deadlocks=3D0 to avoid this.
We will see if it is possible to disable tsan for just
qht_map_lock/unlock_buckets

This one we disabled in the suppressions.txt file.
TSan reports a double lock even when the mutex is flagged as recursive.
