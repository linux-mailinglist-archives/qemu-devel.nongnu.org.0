Yes & no.  Libvirt attempts to explicitly configure the guest so
that it has a stable ABI, and thus can theoretically be migrated
We doesn't try to secondguess which QEMU features may or may not
be migratable though.

It is valid to boot a guest with an attached PCI device, which will
make it non-migratable, but later hot-unplug the PCI device before
starting the migration.

I think it would be useful.

No, we don't look at stderr - that's just going into a logfile.

When I refer to deprecated featurs here, I'm talking specifically
about stuff we see from the QAPI schema. Right now that means
CPU models and machine types with the deprecated flag. It can be
extended to other devices later.
