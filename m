I was going to reply but you were faster to apply. Here is some more
context.

The XIVE interrupt mode is activated by default in 4.1. So these are 
regressions w.r.t to the previous mode spapr was using referred as 
XICS. Specially the first patch.

The second patch is a fix for the restoration of the hot-plugged CPUs.
The restoration of the spapr machine became more complex with the 
XIVE interrupt controller because when we need the machine state to be 
loaded to know which KVM IRQ device to activate, XICS or XIVE. From 
there we can restore the KVM states and HW contexts of the different 
models in use, sources, controllers and presenters. 

The post_load handler of the spapr machine relies on the fact that 
it is called last and does the work for all models. I realized last 
evening that this is not true for hot-plugged CPUs which state come 
after the machine. I was under the assumption/impression this was 
not the case but I might be mistaken. It took me while to get the 
save/restore sequences correct. 


Thanks,

C.
