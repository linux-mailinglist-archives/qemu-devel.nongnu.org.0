I'm not sure yet if there are the x86-specific goals and
constraints that would make it difficult to follow the same
approach followed by s390x.  I have the impression we do,
but I need to think more carefully about it.

Let's discuss that during KVM Forum?

The two main goals of versioned CPU models in x86 are:
1) Decoupling CPU model updates from machine-types (users should be
   able to update a CPU model definition without changing machine
   type).
2) Letting management software automate CPU model updates.
   Normally this is necessary when bare metal microcode or
   software updates add/remove features from CPUs.  Sometimes the
   Virtual CPU model update needs to be performed before the host
   updates are applied (if features are being removed).

The main constraint that makes it difficult to address the above
without a new API is:
A) Every CPU model in x86 except "host" is already expected to
   be migration-safe (I don't know how this compares to s390x).
