When I say that "compressed data clusters are treated the same as in
images without this feature" I mean that there are no semantic
changes. I don't think it's necessary to add anything else considering
that the sentence immediately after that one says that the L2 entry size
is now 128 bits, so it's not hard to guess that compressed cluster
descriptors must somehow be affected by this.

Correct (without the 'maybe')

This is an error in all cases.

The last one is also an error.

No difference:

    /* ... */ if (!(l2_entry & L2E_OFFSET_MASK)) {
        /* Offset 0 generally means unallocated, but it is ambiguous with
         * external data files because 0 is a valid offset there. However, all
         * clusters in external data files always have refcount 1, so we can
         * rely on QCOW_OFLAG_COPIED to disambiguate. */
        if (has_data_file(bs) && (l2_entry & QCOW_OFLAG_COPIED)) {
            return QCOW2_CLUSTER_NORMAL;
        } else {
            return QCOW2_CLUSTER_UNALLOCATED;
        }
    } /* ... */

This code doesn't change if there are subclusters, and is still used to
determine whether a cluster is allocated or not, and therefore whether
the subcluster allocation bits need to be checked or not.

Yes, that is possible with subclusters (unless there's a bug).

Yes, we definitely don't want to make 10 and 11 synonymous. One of them
should return an error and maybe in the future we can think of a new
meaning.

From the implementation point of view there's no difference in
complexity.
