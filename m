I think if we're hosting our own docs we should just link to
our own docs (which include the not-yet-converted-to-rST
parts, which readthedocs doesn't); linking to two different
versions of the same thing is just going to confuse users.

We should remove it; it's been really helpful for the project
that Stefan Weil has provided built-documentation we can link
to for all these years, but now we finally have an "authoritative"
built version on qemu.org that's what we should link to.
Again, having multiple links to different versions of the
same thing would just confuse people. (The exception is that
if we ever decide to provide "version 5.0 docs", "version 5.1
docs", "current master docs" on qemu.org we can do that, because
that's an understandable-to-end-users easily-describable reason
for there being different docs links).

Just link to master/ would be my advice. Otherwise when we
add a new top-level manual (eg the under-discussion tools/
manual) we'll need to update this web page as well.
