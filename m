warning is a bad idea, that usually leads to troubles down the road.

Provided that code is relatively new and produces misconfigured CPUs
and if nobody insists on keeping bug around, I'd try to go for erroring out=
.
Yes that would break misconfigured configs but that could be fixed by
reconfiguring on user side.

That's a headache for maintaing point of view, so again if nobody insist
I'd rather avoid it.
