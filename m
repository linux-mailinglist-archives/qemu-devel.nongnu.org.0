I think this need to be considered very carefully.

I'm not overly familiar with the Python ecosystem but it would appear
that, despite PEP 440 not mandating this, many (most?) of the
packages uploaded to PyPi are using semantic versioning.

With that in mind, I think it would be unwise for qemu.* not to do
the same; in particular, using a version number that's not <1.0.0 for
a package that is very much in flux will almost certainly break
people's expectations, and is also not something that you can easily
take back at a later time.
