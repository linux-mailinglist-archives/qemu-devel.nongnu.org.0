Thanks for the info about =E2=80=98mtree=E2=80=99 QMP option. We=E2=80=99l=
l use that to better explain the need for offset
during memory allocation.

As we can observe from the =E2=80=98mtree=E2=80=99 output, different =
sections of system memory vector into the
RAM. Since we have only one file descriptor available for all of RAM, we =
need to mmap() these
sections at different offsets within the memory file.

Hey Igor, the offset passed into the mmap() syscall is the offset within =
host file. Thanks for
pointing out that these are aliases. I believe the mmap() operation is =
equivalent to the =E2=80=9Calias=E2=80=9D
operation within MemoryRegion framework. We are sending the =E2=80=98fd=E2=
=80=99, =E2=80=98offset=E2=80=99 within the fd and
the size of these RAM regions to the remote device over the unix socket. =
Hopefully, this looks
good to you.

Thanks!
