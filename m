Hmm, that's a bug:

My rewrite preserves this bug.  Will fix in v2.

Yes.

QemuOpts is a language without syntax errors.

Correct.

We want the concatenated string to parse into the concatenation of the
parse of its parts.  Whether "same number" implies that is an
interesting puzzle, but not one worth solving today :)

Yes, it's *semantically* invalid.  It parses as sugar for "help=3Don,=3Don"=
,
except "help=3Don" doesn't get you help, only "help" does.

Yes.  If the empty option existed, concatenation would not do.  It
doesn't now, and I expect it to stay that way.
