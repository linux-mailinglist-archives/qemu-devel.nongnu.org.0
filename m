I am not sure about cache options. So if we want to share a directory
between multiple guests with stronger coherency (cache=3Dnone), then admin
should decide that cache=3Dalways/auto is not supported on this export.

Also, how will one client know whether there are other clients same
directory with strong coherency requirements and it should use cache=3Dnone
instead of cache=3Dalways/auto.

Having said that, it also makes sense that client knows its workoad
and can decide if cache=3Dauto works best for it and use that instead.

May be we need both client and server side options. Client will request
certain cache=3Dxxx options and server can deny these if admin decides
not to enable that option for that particular mount.

For example, if admin decides that we can only support cache=3Dnone on
this particular dir due to other guest sharing it, then daemon should
be able to deny cache=3Dauto/always requests from client.

Thanks
Vivek
