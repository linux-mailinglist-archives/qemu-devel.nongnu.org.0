Thanks for raising this discussion.  That's something I wanted to raise too
but I just haven't, at least formally.

Actually I think I raised this question once or twice, but I just didn't
insist trying. :)

I still remember you mentioned the upper layer softwares can have
assumption on using only 1 pair of socket for migration, I think that makes
postcopy-preempt by default impossible.

Why multifd is different here?

This one is kind of special and it'll be harder, IMHO.

AFAIU, postcopy users will always initiate the migration with at least a
full round of precopy, with the hope that all the static guest pages will
be migrated.

It could even keep going with the 2nd, or 3rd iteration until the VM admin
thinks it's proper to trigger the last phase postcopy. So at least for some
use scenarios the switch of pre->post does require human resource
intervention.

However we could still have some parameter so that when the user wants to
let QEMU decide the time of switch, then we could at least still consider:

  -global migration.postcopy-auto-switch=off|on|immediate

We could define "off|on|immediate" as:

  - "off": this should still be the default, means we need another
    migrate-start-postcopy QMP command to trigger the switch

  - "first": this can mean that right after we finish the 1st round
    migration we automatically switch to postcopy

  - "immediate": this will be the most interesting that I wanted to try
    out, which is.. we could consider start postcopy right now without
    precopy.  It further means:

    - KVM dirty tracking is not needed at all, because all pages are dirty
      by default on dest qemu, so all pages need to be requested.  This
      removes _all_ dirty tracking complexity.

    - It will be the most bandwidth-friendly solution, because literally
      each guest page is only sent once.

I could have got off-topic a bit more especially on the "immediate" option
above, but since we're talking about auto-switch of postcopy I want to
mention this because this has been in my mind for a very long time...

> We should further be able to add pre-emption if we find it available.

Yeah here I have the same question per multifd above.  I just have no idea
whether QEMU has such knowledge on making this decision.  E.g., how could
QEMU know whether upper app is not tunneling the migration stream?  How
could QEMU know whether the upper app could handle multiple tcp sockets
well?

Let's see how Juan/Dave/others think.. anyway, that's something I always
wanted.

IMHO an even simpler term can be as simple as:

  -global migration.handshake=on

But the naming is not anything important. The idea should always be that
the protocol should not be static anymore (which was only based on
cap/params set by the user) but it can be dynamic depending on how the
handshake/negotiation goes.

I would very much second that idea if it'll come one day.

This new capability will simply need to depend on the return-path
capability we already have.  E.g. exec-typed migration won't be able to
enable return-path, so not applicable to this one too.

When we introduce return-path capability, we _could_ have already required
handshake already.  We didn't, iirc, because at that time I haven't thought
solid on how to define this dynamic protocol, and there we have a real
problem to solve, which is when dest QEMU failed to load the last phase of
device state we used to have a bug (when without return-path capability)
that both QEMUs will quit and VM data corrupted.

The new return-path well resolve that problem because that allows the dest
QEMU to do a very last phase ACK to source telling the source QEMU to quit,
otherwise the src QEMU will always contain the most latest guest pages
(we're only talking about precopy here, of course..).

No strong opinion on which QEMU should start the conversation, just to
mention that we may not be able to use this to identify whether it's an old
or new QEMU, afaiu, because of network delays?

We can never tell whether the dest QEMU didn't talk is because it's an old
binary or it's new binary but with high latency network.
