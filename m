We need user creatable phbs for a handful of reasons.

Let's suppose we go this route and all PHBs are available all the time and user just
adds root-ports. Using spapr-phb as the closest example of a default PHB that's always
available, we would need to express the PHBs in the XML. For a 4 socket powernv9 domain
we would have 24 PHBs in the XML.

No, hiding them is not an option because it would break assumptions Libvirt makes where all
PCI controllers are expressed in the XML, and the controller relationship via controller
indexes are awlays explicit. Having "ghost PHBs" that exists but aren't visible in the
XML was something that I was having to deal with with user creatable PEC controllers and
it's both complex to do and and has a good chance of getting NACKed by the community
because it's too hard to use. So having these default PHBs expressed in the XML would be a
must.

So right off the bat, for a 1 socket powernv9 machine, we'll have 6 phbs that will need
to be in the XML regardless of being used or not. And for each socket added/remove we'll
have to add/remove default PHBs available in the domain XML. So if the user starts with
1 sockets, and then adds a root port, the XML can look similar to this:

     <controller type='pci' index='0' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='1' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='2' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='3' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='4' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='5' model='pcie-root'/>
     <controller type='pci' index='6' model='pcie-root-port'/>
     (... user adds more controllers with index=7,8 ...)

Now if the user adds another socket we have a problem. The root ports and other devices will
be using controller indexes that the default PHBs would use. The user did a CPU topology
change and now will have to adjust PCI topology as a result. Similar complications will
happen if the user then removes a socket from the domain.

Now, with user creatable PHBs, the situation above will be expressed like:


     <controller type='pci' index='0' model='pcie-root'/>
       <model name='pnv-phb4'/>
       <target index='4' chip-id='0'/>
     </controller>
     <controller type='pci' index='1' model='pcie-root-port'/>
     (... user adds more controllers with index=2,3 ...)

If the user adds 4 sockets this doesn't change because Libvirt is creating a single PHB and
renaming it to 'pcie.0' to be consistent. If the user decides, in a 2 socket pnv9 domain, to use
the PHB that belongs to the second chip, the only change is the chip-id element:


     <controller type='pci' index='0' model='pcie-root'/>
       <model name='pnv-phb4'/>
       <target index='4' chip-id='1'/>
     </controller>
     <controller type='pci' index='1' model='pcie-root-port'/>
     (... user adds more controllers with index=2,3 ...)

If the user then removes the socket the domain will error out when starting because you're creating a
PHB with a wrong chip-id. A simple matter of changing the chip-id value while retaining the PCI topology
as is, without needing to reassign controller indexes all over again.

Another big deal is to able to rename buses. Libvirt uses 'pcie.N' with these controllers,
we're using 'pnv-phb3/4-root-bus'. Without user creatable PHBs we would be signing a contract
with Libvirt that we will never rename these buses in QEMU side again, once Libvirt starts
support it, because now Libvirt is counting on this info to correctly assign the root ports to
the specific PHBs. Being able to rename the buses is also crucial for the PCI topology
consistency I commented above.

There's also a good argument about long term extensibility. We're doing a lot of work in the
QEMU side but we'll be able to later on the road, for instance, support multiple root-ports in
the same PHB, or even devices other than root-ports in PHBs, device hotplug and so on with
minimal - and most important, backward friendly - Libvirt changes. Having default PHBs appearing
all the time will force us to make several assumptions that we wouldn't be able to break later on,
and probably will break older domains that were created before the changes.


I am probably forgetting more problems that this would cause in Libvirt. But at last, but definitely
not the least for the implementation of the Libvirt side, we (in this case, I) would need to make lots
and lots of code to support default PHBs that can be added/removed via SMP changes, while trying to
keep existing PCI topologies minimally consistent, with lots of documentation explaining why are we
adding/removing default PHBs due to SMP changes, and in the end the user experience would still
be awkward.


Enabling user creatable pnv-phb3/phb4 is the way for Libvirt support, and I daresay it also makes
for an improved QEMU experience as well. If I want a -nodefaults machine with 4 sockets but only 2 PHBs
I can do that after this series. Decopling SMP from PCI topology has advantages outside of Libvirt
support.
