Yes, copy&paste mistake, had the same issue over in 
https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse/blob/master/Documentation/inter-cell-communication.md

Yes, you need to adjust that command line - didn't I document that 
somewhere? Looks like I didn't:

ivshmem2-server -F -l 1M -n 2 -V 2 -P 0x8002

i.e. a bit more memory is good (but this isn't speed-optimized anyway), 
you only need 2 vectors here (but more do not harm), and the protocol 
indeed needs adjustment (that is the key).
