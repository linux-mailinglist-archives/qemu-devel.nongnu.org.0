It is not broken.=20

PowerNV machines can boot rather complex PCI layouts on P8 (XICS)=20

It hasn't been posted in a long time (+1 year). Here are the latest

  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/951227/

  - check if we need a separate source model for the MSI/LSI=20
  - rework the PBCQ modeling to some extent.
  - misc cleanups.
