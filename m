Ok

It is documented later in the same patch ("Subcluster Allocation Bitmap
for compressed clusters").

By the way, this series treats an L2 entry as invalid if any of those
bits is not zero, but I think I'll change that. Conceivably those bits
could be used for a future compatible feature, but it can only be
compatible if the previous versions ignore those bits.

Since 00 means unallocated and 01 allocated, there are two options left
to represent the "reads as zero" case: 10 and 11.

I think that one could argue for either one and there is no "right"
choice. I chose the former because I understood the allocation bit as
"the guest visible data is obtained from the raw data in that
subcluster" but the other option also makes sense.
