Yes, that's where I put it.

You may doubt the quality of their support, but I think it's even more
doubtful that they'll do a version upgrade in oldstable.

The release notes for 3.6 call this an implementation detail that you
shouldn't rely on. However, 3.7 guarantees the order, so I guess we can
effectively rely on it starting from 3.6.
