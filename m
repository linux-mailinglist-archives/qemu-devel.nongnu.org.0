But the thing running in userspace might be QEMU, which doesn't know
the semantics of the BAR, it might not be until a driver in the guest
that we have something that understands the BAR semantics beyond opaque
data.  We might have nested guests, so it could be passed through
multiple userspaces as opaque data.  The requirement make no sense.

And we don't, DPDK, SPDK, various other userspaces exist.  All can take
advantage of the migration uAPI that we've developed rather than
implementing device specific code in their projects.  I'm not sure how
this is strengthening your argument for device specific migration code
in QEMU, which would need to be replicated in every other userspace.  As
opaque data with a well defined protocol, each userspace can implement
support for this migration protocol once and it should work independent
of the device or vendor.  It only requires support in the code
implementing the device, which is already necessarily device specific.

The kernel is a different beast, it already supports loadable modules
and due to whatever pressures or market demands of the past, it allows
non-GPL use of symbols necessary for some of those modules.  QEMU has
no module support outside of non-mainline forks.  Clearly there is
pressure to support sub-process and proprietary device emulation and
it's our choice how we enable that.  This vfio over socket approach is
the mechanism we're trying to enable to avoid proprietary modules in
QEMU proper.

A migration compatibility interface has not been determined for vfio.
We currently rely on the vendor drivers to provide their own internal
validation and harmlessly reject migration from an incompatible device.
It would be great if we could make progress on this, but it's a
difficult problem, and one that I hope we can further address once we
have a base level of migration support.

It's great to revisit ideas, but proclaiming a uAPI is bad solely
because the data transfer is opaque, without defining why that's bad,
evaluating the feasibility and implementation of defining a well
specified data format rather than protocol, including cross-vendor
support, or proposing any sort of alternative is not so helpful imo.

Note that we also migrate guest memory as opaque data; we don't require
knowing the data structures it holds or how regions are used, we simply
look for changes and transfer the new data.  That's not so different
from a vendor driver passing us a blob of data as "information it needs
to replicate the device state at the target."  Thanks,

Alex
