Title:
  qga fail to start when pidfile path is missing

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  The qga main program has two parameters: "--logfile" and "--pidfile"
  which specifies the paths to the logfile and pidfile. It assumes that
  the paths exit in the running OS but if not, the qga will fail to
  start.I think qga should create the missing paths.

  I found this bug exits in several Linux distributions including Ubuntu
  14, Cent-OS 6 and 7 when the original and the latest master qga
  applies. I have a patch which can fix it. Should I patch it to the
  QEMU master branch?
