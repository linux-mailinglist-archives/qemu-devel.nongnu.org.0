This did not happen in Eoan (qemu 4.0.0). I was able to switch in/out of
a VM with my audio coming through fine. I enabled Eoan in my
sources.list, downgraded all my qemu packages, and the issue was
resolved.

This happens on the latest Windows 10 guest when a sound device is
listening for the microphone.

/var/log/libvirt/qemu/<vmname>.log spews this error out when I switch
with evdev (which is just the keyboard and mouse, the audio is passed
through I assume spice):
