Well, I guess I can only answer this after seeing the bug reports we
would get after removing the check. :-)

Your choice. I'm not opposed to anything that feels like it makes sense.

The difference is that with the replace operation we aren't talking
about hypothetical corrupted disks (like we would get when accessing
intermediate nodes of the commit job), but about two actual disk images
that are both valid, though different.

But yes, maybe we should avoid this discussion...

(I mean, what it *really* means is "this is not an intermediate node
of commit". ;-))

Oh, compared to taking WRITE and unsharing CONSISTENT_READ it's probably
not more restrictice. I was comparing with the case that drops the
checks altogether.

Fine with me.
