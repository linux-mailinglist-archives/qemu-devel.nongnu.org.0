  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
