Let me try to clarify.

Option: make the "already active holding @secret" case an error like the
"already active holding another secret" case.  In longhand:

     - @keyslot present

       The keyslot given by @keyslot.

       If it's already active, error.

It feels inelegant to me, because it deviates from "specify desired
state" paradigm: the specified desired state is fine, the way to get
there from current state is obvious (do nothing), yet it's still an
error.

It's a matter of taste.

If we interpret "both absent" as "all keyslots", then all cases flow out
of the following simple spec:

    0. Start with the set of all keyslots

    1. If @old-secret is present, interset it with the set of slots
       holding that secret.

    2. If @keyslots is present, intersect it with the set of slots with
       that slot number.

The order of steps 1 and 2 doesn't matter.

To error out unconditionally, we have to make "both absent" a special
case.

A good way to resolve such matters of taste is to try writing doc
comments for all proposals.  If you find you hate one of them much less,
you have a winner :)
