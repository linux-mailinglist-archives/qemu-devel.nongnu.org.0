This is the follow-up of:
  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200924160423.106747-1-david@redhat.com
to make vfio and virtio-mem play together. The basic idea was the result of
Alex brainstorming with me on how to tackle this.

A virtio-mem device manages a memory region in guest physical address
space, represented as a single (currently large) memory region in QEMU,
mapped into system memory address space. Before the guest is allowed to use
memory blocks, it must coordinate with the hypervisor (plug blocks). After
a reboot, all memory is usually unplugged - when the guest comes up, it
detects the virtio-mem device and selects memory blocks to plug (based on
resize requests from the hypervisor).

Memory hot(un)plug consists of (un)plugging memory blocks via a virtio-mem
device (triggered by the guest). When unplugging blocks, we discard the
memory - similar to memory balloon inflation. In contrast to memory
ballooning, we always know which memory blocks a guest may actually use -
especially during a reboot, after a crash, or after kexec (and during
hibernation as well). Guests agreed to no access unplugged memory again,
especially not via DMA.

The issue with vfio is, that it cannot deal with random discards - for this
reason, virtio-mem and vfio can currently only run mutually exclusive.
Especially, vfio would currently map the whole memory region (with possible
only little/no plugged blocks), resulting in all pages getting pinned and
therefore resulting in a higher memory consumption than expected (turning
virtio-mem basically useless in these environments).

To make vfio work nicely with virtio-mem, we have to map only the plugged
blocks, and map/unmap properly when plugging/unplugging blocks (including
discarding of RAM when unplugging). We achieve that by using a new notifier
mechanism that communicates changes.

It's important to map memory in the granularity in which we could see
unmaps again (-> virtio-mem block size) - so when e.g., plugging
consecutive 100 MB with a block size of 2MB, we need 50 mappings. When
unmapping, we can use a single vfio_unmap call for the applicable range.
We expect that the block size of virtio-mem devices will be fairly large
in the future (to not run out of mappings and to improve hot(un)plug
performance), configured by the user, when used with vfio (e.g., 128MB,
1G, ...).

More info regarding virtio-mem can be found at:
    https://virtio-mem.gitlab.io/
I'll add a guide for virtio-mem+vfio soonish.

v1 is located at:
  git@github.com:davidhildenbrand/qemu.git virtio-mem-vfio-v1

RFC - v1:
- VFIO migration code. Due to missing kernel support, I cannot really test
  if that part works.
- Understand/test/document vIOMMU implications, also regarding migration
- Nicer ram_block_discard_disable/require handling.
- s/SparseRAMHandler/RamDiscardMgr/, refactorings, cleanups, documentation,
  testing, ...

David Hildenbrand (9):
  memory: Introduce RamDiscardMgr for RAM memory regions
  virtio-mem: Factor out traversing unplugged ranges
  virtio-mem: Implement RamDiscardMgr interface
  vfio: Support for RamDiscardMgr in the !vIOMMU case
  vfio: Support for RamDiscardMgr in the vIOMMU case
  softmmu/physmem: Don't use atomic operations in
    ram_block_discard_(disable|require)
  softmmu/physmem: Extend ram_block_discard_(require|disable) by two
    discard types
  virtio-mem: Require only coordinated discards
  vfio: Disable only uncoordinated discards
