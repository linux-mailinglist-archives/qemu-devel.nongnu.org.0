Yes,  but I didn't find a good place to release these test codes currently.

All the test cases will be validated in Spike,  which has supported the 
same vector specification. But this  cross validation work may delay 
until V3.
I will split the patch, and address comments as soon as possible, to 
ensure the patch V2 can be sent next week.
Would it be all right?

There is usually a big difference between new a ISA extension and the 
others. I doubt there is an general framework. A very light framework  
includes
building, input aiding  generation, result validation, and report maybe 
OK .
