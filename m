Ah, good point - thanks for pointing that out.

Yeah this is a little weird I'll admit. The architectural feature is 
described per-CPU (well "processing element"), but it makes little sense 
to have it only on some CPUs and has effects on the rest of the memory 
system. Given that it's theoretically possible to build e.g. a 
big.LITTLE setup with only some CPUs support MTE it seemed more 
future-proof to design the API to allow it even though I hope no-one 
will use it.

I think I've probably explained this badly.

The guest can choose how to populate the stage 1 mapping - so can choose 
which parts of memory are accessed tagged or not. However, the 
hypervisor cannot restrict this in stage 2 (except by e.g. making the 
memory uncached but that's obviously not great - however devices forward 
to the guest can be handled like this).

Because the hypervisor cannot restrict the guest's access to the tags, 
the hypervisor must assume that all memory given to the guest could have 
the tags accessed. So it must (a) clear any stale data from the tags, 
and (b) ensure that the tags are preserved (e.g. when swapping pages out).

Because of the above the current series automatically sets PG_mte_tagged 
on the pages. Note that this doesn't change the mappings that the VMM 
has (a non-PROT_MTE mapping will still not have access to the tags).

It's a shame that the stage-2 can't usefully restrict tag access, but 
this matches the architectural expectation: that if MTE is supported 
then all standard memory will be MTE-enabled.

Yes, the question is can the VMM (sensibly) wrap the accesses with a 
disable/renable tag checking for the process sequence. The alternative 
at the moment is to maintain a separate (untagged) mapping for the 
purpose which might present it's own problems.

Certainly possible, although it seems to conflate two operations: "get 
list of dirty pages", "get tags from page". It would also require a lot 
of return space (size of slot/32).

This is certainly one option. The architecture provides two "magic" 
values (all-0s and all-1s) which can be configured using TCMAx to be 
treated differently. The VMM could therefore construct pointers to 
otherwise tagged memory which would be treated as untagged.

However, Catalin's user space series doesn't at the moment expose this 
functionality.
