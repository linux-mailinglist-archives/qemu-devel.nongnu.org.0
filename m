So originally I thought:
- add some interface in the kernel to signal new behaviour
- start with a whitelist in qemu
- if not on the whitelist, check the new interface
- if not there, check a "force" flag on the device

But one problem with all of the above is that it's actually
too late. With a broken driver when management sets MAC on the
to-be-primary VF traffic stops being sent to standby.

People tend to ignore warnings :)
