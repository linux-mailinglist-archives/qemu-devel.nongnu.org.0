Folks,

Thanks for everyone involved, esp. Philippe for devising the proposal and
citing the manual about UNPREDICTABLE meaning, but I think this is too late
to fix it in 5.0 (too risky), so let's talk about it in 5.0+.

Yours,
Aleksandar

&gt; &gt; In MIPS architectures prior to Release 6. if a control transfer <=
br>
&gt; &gt; instruction (CTI) is placed in a branch delay slot, the operation=
 of <br>
&gt; &gt; both instructions is UNPREDICTABLE. In Release 6, if a CTI is pla=

&gt; &gt; a branch delay slot or a compact branch forbidden slot, implement=
ations <br>
&gt; &gt; are required to signal a Reserved Instruction exception.<br>

&gt; Release 6 (which I&#39;m not familiar with).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; The following instructions are forbidden in branch delay slots an=

&gt; &gt; forbidden slots: any CTI, including branches and jumps, ERET, ERE=
TNC, <br>

&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; If an exception or interrupt prevents the completion of an instru=

cate <br>
&gt; &gt; that the exception was for the instruction in the delay slot of t=

&gt; &gt; By convention, if an exception or interrupt prevents the completi=

should <br>

&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 branches in a delay slot is &quot;undefined&quot; in=
 the pre-Release<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 6 architecture. MIPS architectre release 6 defines t=
o signal<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Reserved Instruction exceptions for such cases.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; But it really appears as UNPREDICTABLE.<br>

<p dir=3D"ltr">Folks,</p>
<p dir=3D"ltr">Thanks for everyone involved, esp. Philippe for devising the=
 proposal and citing the manual about UNPREDICTABLE meaning, but I think th=
is is too late to fix it in 5.0 (too risky), so let&#39;s talk about it in =
5.0+.</p>
