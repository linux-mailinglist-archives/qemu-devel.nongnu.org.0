probably not entirely.

Understand this isn't an either/or scenario. Our api has been designed to
support multiple "propagation" methods for the ssh keys. We've converged on
the qemu guest agent for some other features and the agent appears to have
the potential to provide us the greatest flexibility when it comes to how
we want this pub ssh key use case to work.  This isn't to say something
like virtiofs won't make sense either in certain scenarios, but for the
purposes of this discussion we're hoping to explore how the qemu guest
agent could be used.

I don't want to go too deep into the shared filesystem approach. I'll
provide some context on the challenges there though.

- virtiofs requires guest kernel >= 5.4. We aren't considering 9p due to
security/performance concerns.
- file ownership/permissions. requires prior knowledge of uid/gid on the
host.
- persistence. if we share authorised_keys via virtiofs, then we have to
put this on a separate persistent network volume (otherwise user
modifications within guest are lost)
- potentially clobbers existing authorization_keys file on disk, with agent
we can merge our additions/removals to whatever the user has set in
authorized_keys.
- lack of KubeVirt support for virtiofs. however, it will likely make it
soon
