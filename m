I guess you tried to include it into target-independent code, which
doesn't work since we added target conditionals like

    { 'command': 'rtc-reset-reinjection',
      'if': 'defined(TARGET_I386)' }

Adding these (merge commit a0430dd8abb) was only possible because the
code generated from the QAPI schema mirrors the QAPI schema's modular
structure: just like qapi-schema.json includes its sub-modules such as
common.json, the generated qapi-visit.h includes the headers generated
for its sub-modules such as qapi-visit-common.h.  See commit 252dc3105f
"qapi: Generate separate .h, .c for each module".

The original motivation for this modularization was actually compile
time.  Before modularization, touching the QAPI schema typically
recompiled everything using QAPI, which nowadays means pretty much
everything.  Modularization let me replace "include all generated QAPI
stuff" by "include just the generated QAPI stuff I actually need", for
*massive* compile time improvements.

Back to target conditionals.  Right now, we confine them to sub-module
target.json.  This means the headers generated for this sub-module, such
as qapi-visit-target.h, can only be included into target-dependent code.
Since qapi-visit.h includes all sub-modules, it can also only be
included there.

No for two reasons:

1. The code generating qapi-visit.h has no idea which sub-modules are
target-specific.

2. You shouldn't include qapi-visit.h anyway, it's bad for compile time.

Yes.

Put the declaration of qdev_prop_multifd_compress and the macro in the
same source file.  Simplest: qdev-properties.h.

You can certainly declare enums anywhere, you just have to make sure to
include the right headers in the right places, just like for manually
written enums in C headers.

Rules for modular QAPI schema:

1. If module A uses an entity defined in module B, A must include B

   Example: since migration.json uses MultifdCompress defined in
   common.json, migration.json must include common.json (it does).

2. No circular includes, ever.

3. Try to avoid cross-module dependencies

   Example: migration.json uses MultifdCompress defined in common.json.
   This is a cross-module dependency.  Can we avoid it by moving
   MultifdCompress into migration.json?

   The QAPI schema would be just fine with such a move, but C code using
   the generated headers might be unhappy, because it now has to include
   qapi-types-migration.h instead of just qapi-types-common.h.

   My question was: is C code really unhappy?  Please find out and tell
   me.
