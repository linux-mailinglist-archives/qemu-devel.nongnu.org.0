There is at the virtio transport level: the driver sets status to
FEATURES_OK once it accepted the feature bits, and to DRIVER_OK once its
fully operational. The virtio-iommu spec says:

  If the driver does not accept the VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS feature, the
  device SHOULD NOT let endpoints access the guest-physical address space.

So before features negotiation, there is no access. Afterwards it depends
if the VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS has been accepted by the driver.

I don't remember writing down a rationale for this bit, it was in the very
first version (I think someone suggested it during the initial internal
discussion) and I didn't remove it afterwards because it seems useful:

Say a guest only wants to use the vIOMMU for userspace assignment and
wants all other endpoints to bypass translation, which is our primary
use-case. In other words booting Linux with iommu.passthrough=1. It can
either create an identity domain for each endpoint (one MAP request with
VA==PA) or it can set the VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS bit. The device-side
implementation should be more efficient with the latter, since you don't
need to lookup the domain + address space for each access.

Hmm, that was regarding a "bypass" reserved memory region, which isn't in
the current spec.

What do you mean by system bootstrap?

One thing I've been wondering, and may be related, is how to handle a
bootloader that wants to read for example an initrd from a virtio-block
device that's behind the IOMMU. Either we allow the device to let any DMA
bypass the device until FEATURES_OK, which is a source of vulnerabilities
[1], or we have to implement some support for the virtio-iommu in the
BIOS. Again the F_BYPASS bit would help for this, since all the BIOS has
to do is set it on boot. However, F_BYPASS is optional, and more complex
support is needed for setting up identity mappings.

[1] See "IOMMU protection against I/O attacks: a vulnerability and a proof
of concept" by Morgan et al, where a malicious device bypassing the IOMMU
overwrites the IOMMU configuration as it is being created by the OS.
Arguably we're not too concerned about malicious devices at the moment,
but I'm not comfortable relaxing this.

Yes bypass mode assumes that devices and drivers aren't malicious, and the
IOMMU is only used for things like assigning devices to guest userspace,
or having large contiguous DMA buffers.

Thanks,
Jean
