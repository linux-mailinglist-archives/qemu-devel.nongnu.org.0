The Clipper emulation *already* implements a Frankenstein model, a =
combination of hardware that DEC never shipped.  While some =
Tsunami-based systems did use the Cypress bridge, none of them, to my =
knowledge, had the CMD646 IDE controller.  The only system I'm aware of =
that shipped with a CMD646 IDE controller was the early version of the =
Miata (EV56 + Pyxis-based Digital Personal Workstation), and that system =
had the Intel i82378 PCI-ISA bridge.

The are a lot of differences in the Cypress PCI-ISA bridge, but most =
importantly, it has a different interrupt controller (the ELCR registers =
are programmed differently), and it has a different built-in IDE =
controller.  As far as I can tell, Qemu does not currently have =
emulation for the Cypress interrupt controller nor the Cypress IDE =
controller.

All Alpha systems that had a PCI-ISA bridge[*] shipped with, as far as =
I'm aware, one of 3 possible chips:

- Intel i82378 SIO
- Cypress 82C693
- Acer Labs M1533

...and the emulation provided by the existing Clipper model implements =
the Intel flavor (including the interrupt controller).  I just want =
software that expects one of those 3 chips to be there to work.  The =
existing emulation seems to assume that system software will just go out =
and probe the peripherals in the ISA space, but some operating systems =
(NetBSD in particular) support Alpha systems that have PCI without any =
ISA/LPC bus at all, and thus only go looking for ISA peripherals if a =
PCI-ISA bridge is present.  That is what my change here is intended to =
do, without changing any of the rest of the hardware configuration.


[*] ...ignoring the weirdo early models that had PCI + EISA + =
oddly-wired-up junk I/O chips.  Also, I don't have any direct experience =
with post-Titan models, so I'm not sure what they have...
