I haven't looked at the disassembler code; assuming it comes from an
upstream code base I don't think we should treat it differently from the
ARM disassembler (or for that matter the binutils ones) and basically
handle it as a black box for which we don't really care about the code
quality or style. It's not security sensitive code, and forking the
upstream is probably not justified. On the other hand the pull request
should have explained the provenance of the code (even if only in the
subject line of the relevant patch).

Regarding the recommendation of a "vacation" after last week's facts,
QEMU's enforcing of behavior standards so far has been informal, therefore
my suggestion cannot be anything more than a suggestion, though a strongly
recommended one. I can also understand the soft freeze pressure. I defer to
Peter as to whether to merge this pull request or not due to Thomas's
objections, but I do wish to reinforce that taking some time off to cool
down can often times be a good idea.

Thanks,

Paolo
