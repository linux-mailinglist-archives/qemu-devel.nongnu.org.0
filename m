Right, and it's probably sufficient to just switch to this function
for assigning affinity fields of MPIDRs for both TCG and KVM. Currently
it's only for TCG, as the comment in it explains, but it does the same
thing as KVM anyway. So, while nothing should change from the view of
the guest, userspace gains control over the MPIDRs, and that allows it
to build VCPU topologies more smoothly and in advance of VCPU creation.
