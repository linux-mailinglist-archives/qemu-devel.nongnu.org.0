Replacements have been proposed several times, but they went nowhere
because they replicated the HMP commands' design flaws in QMP.  Here's
one that got some design analysis in its review, by yours truly:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-01/msg03593.html

Sane QMP replacements are certainly possible, but so far nobody has
cared enough to pitch in the work.
