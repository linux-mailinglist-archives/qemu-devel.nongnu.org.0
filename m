Could we assert(parent || bus == main_system_bus) in qbus_realize()?

Aside: I hate sysbus_get_default().  It creates main_system_bus on first
call, wherever that call may be hiding.  I feel we should create it
explicitly.  I'd then make main_system_bus public, and delete
sysbus_get_default().

Hmm.

The one in vl.c arranges to run qbus_reset_all(main_system_bus), which
walks the tree rooted at main_system_bus, resetting its buses and
devices in post-order.

A registry of callbacks to run on certain events is a fine technique.
Relying on registration order, however, is in bad taste.  We should
model dependencies between reset functions explicitly.

That said, we can't ignore dependencies just because we've coded them
badly.

I count more than 100 qemu_register_reset(), and most of them look like
they reset hardware.  Why do devices use qemu_register_reset() instead
of DeviceClass method reset?

Registered handlers run in (implicitly defined) registration order,
reset methods in (explicit) qdev tree post order.  Much better as long
as that's the order we want.

Say we managed to clean up this mess somehow, so reset handler
registration order doesn't matter anymore.  Then moving the
qemu_register_reset() for main_system_bus from main() to wherever we
create main_system_bus would make sense, wouldn't it?

If it does make sense, we should keep the TODO in main(), because it
asks for exactly that.  Perhaps delete "by qdev.c".

You delete a qemu_register_reset() because it's unreachable.  The commit
that added it also added a qemu_unregister_reset().  It's now in
bus_unparent().  Why is it still needed?
