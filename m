I think it might work when using kvm_kernel_irqchip_allowed() instead of
kvm_kernel_irqchip_required() ... Matthew, could you please give it a
try with this patch on top of mine:

diff --git a/target/s390x/kvm.c b/target/s390x/kvm.c

      */
-    if (kvm_ais_allowed() &&
+    if (kvm_ais_allowed() && kvm_kernel_irqchip_allowed() &&
         kvm_check_extension(s, KVM_CAP_S390_AIS_MIGRATION)) {

     }
