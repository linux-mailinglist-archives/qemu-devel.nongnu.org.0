Until the CAS negotiation is over, an HPT can be allocated on three
different paths:

1) during machine reset if the host doesn't support radix,

2) during CAS if the guest wants hash and doesn't support HPT resizing,
   in which case we pre-emptively resize the HPT to accomodate maxram,

3) during CAS if no CAS reboot was requested, the guest wants hash but
   we're currently configured for radix.

Depending on the various combinations of host or guest MMU support,
HPT resizing guest support and the possibility of a CAS reboot, it
is quite hard to know which of these allocates the HPT that will
be ultimately used by the guest that wants to do hash. Also, some of
them have bugs:

- 2) calls spapr_reallocate_hpt() instead of spapr_setup_hpt_and_vrma()
  and thus doesn't update the VRMA size, even though we've just extended
  the HPT. Not sure what issues this can cause,

- 3) doesn't check for HPT resizing support and will always allocate a
  small HPT based on the initial RAM size. This caps the total amount of
  RAM the guest can see, especially if maxram is much higher than the
  initial ram.

We only support guests that do CAS and we already assume that the HPT
isn't being used when we do the pre-emptive resizing at CAS. It thus
seems reasonable to only allocate the HPT at the end of CAS, when no
CAS reboot was requested.

Consolidate the logic so that we only create the HPT during 3), ie.
when we're done with the CAS reboot cycles, and ensure HPT resizing
is taken into account. This fixes the radix->hash transition for
all cases.

The guest can theoretically call CAS several times, without a CAS
reboot in between. Linux guests don't do that, but better safe than
sorry, let's ensure we can also handle the symmetrical hash->radix
transition correctly: free the HPT and set the GR bit in PATE.
An helper is introduced for the latter since this is already what
we do during machine reset when going for radix.

As a bonus, this removes one user of spapr->cas_reboot, which we
want to get rid of in the future.
