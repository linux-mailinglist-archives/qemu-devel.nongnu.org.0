We have a few options

 1. Use string format for values > 2^53-1, int format below that
 2. Use string format for all fields which are 64-bit ints whether
    signed or unsigned
 3. Use string format for all fields which are integers, even 32-bit
    ones

I would probably suggest option 2. It would make the QEMU impl quite
easy IIUC, we we'd just change the QAPI visitor's impl for the int64
and uint64 fields to use string format (when the right capability is
negotiated by QMP).

I include 3 only for completeness - I don't think there's a hugely
compelling reason to mess with 32-bit ints.

Option 1 is the bare minimum needed to ensure precision, but to me
it feels a bit dirty to say a given field will have different encoding
depending on the value. If apps need to deal with string encoding, they
might as well just use it for all values in a given field.

If it sees a '.' in the number, then it call strtod() and checks for
the overflow conditions.

If it doesn't see a '.' in the number then it calls strtoll and checks
for the overflow conditions.

So to answer you question, yes, it looks like it will reject
9223372036854775808 and accept 9223372036854775808.0 with loss of
precision.
