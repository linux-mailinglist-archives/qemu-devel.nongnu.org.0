We wrote a project that is created on top of the QEMU source code; it calls
functions from the QEMU code.  I run the executable created by compiling
that project/QEMU code.  Anyway, looking at the following documentation:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/powerpc/cpu_families.txt

It looks like the PowerPC 7457 is Book3S and the PowerPC e6500 is BookE.
Is that why you think I require a Book3S KVM?  Exactly why do you feel this
way?  Also would that mean my team would need to go and buy a board with a
Book3S processor?

-Thanks!, Wayne Li

From my understanding
