check:

/**
 * qemu_plugin_reset() - Reset a plugin
 * @id: this plugin's opaque ID
 * @cb: callback to be called once the plugin has been reset
 *
 * Unregisters all callbacks for the plugin given by @id.
 *
 * Do NOT assume that the plugin has been reset once this function returns.
 * Plugins are reset asynchronously, and therefore the given plugin receives
 * callbacks until @cb is called.
 */
void qemu_plugin_reset(qemu_plugin_id_t id, qemu_plugin_simple_cb_t cb);


> - instrumentation at the TB granularity (in addition to the existing
>   instruction-level support)

check

/**
 * qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_tb_trans_cb() - register a translate cb
 * @id: plugin ID
 * @cb: callback function
 *
 * The @cb function is called every time a translation occurs. The @cb
 * function is passed an opaque qemu_plugin_type which it can query
 * for additional information including the list of translated
 * instructions. At this point the plugin can register further
 * callbacks to be triggered when the block or individual instruction
 * executes.
 */

and then you can have instruction or TB level callbacks:

/**
 * qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_tb_trans_exec_cb() - register execution callba=
ck
 * @tb: the opaque qemu_plugin_tb handle for the translation
 * @cb: callback function
 * @flags: does the plugin read or write the CPU's registers?
 * @userdata: any plugin data to pass to the @cb?
 *
 * The @cb function is called every time a translated unit executes.
 */
void qemu_plugin_register_vcpu_tb_exec_cb(struct qemu_plugin_tb *tb,
                                          qemu_plugin_vcpu_udata_cb_t cb,
                                          enum qemu_plugin_cb_flags flags,
                                          void *userdata);

Or the inline equivalent.


> - the ability for a plugin to trigger a checkpoint to be taken

We don't have this at the moment. Pranith also mentioned it in his
review comments. I can see its use but I suspect it won't make the
initial implementation given the broader requirements of QEMU to do
checkpointing and how to cleanly expose that to plugins.
