yes, a command returning a single opaque printf formatted string would
be the common case.  At a more general POV though, the JSON doc received
by the client should be usable "as received", immediately after JSON
de-serialization without needing any further custom parsing on top.

ie if a value needs to be parsed by the client, then it must be split
into multiple distinct values in the QAPI data type design to remove
the need for parsing by the client. 

If a command's design violates that, then it must remain under the
"x-" prefix.  "info registers" is a example because we're printf
formatting each register value into a opaque string. Any client
needing a specific register value would have to scanf parse this
string. The justification for not representing each register as
a distinct QAPI field is that we don't think machines genuinely
need to parse this, as its just adhoc human operator debug info.
So we take the easy option and just printf to a string and put
it under "x-" prefix

Wow, yes, I'm surprised ! A few of those do indeed have QMP
equivalents, but with slight differences eg savevm ->
snapshot-save, but clearly we have a big list regardless
