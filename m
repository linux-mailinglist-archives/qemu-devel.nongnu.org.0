That's a reasonable suggestion. I do like having self-contained
validation, self-contained, but when cross-dependencies arise, then
it does make sense to have a master validation function, rather
than interconnecting too much. That said, for this series we only
enable the qmp query for aarch64, pmu, and sve* properties. aarch64
and pmu are independent, and thus self-contained, and I consider
all sve* properties one big entity, so their validation is also
self-contained. If we add vfp and neon, then indeed I was wrong
with my suggestion in the commit message. They would need a later
validation check. Should we just cross that bridge when we get there
though? Or would you like me to see how that would work within this
series?

Thanks,
