I've intentionally left it out for a lack of clear enough advise.
Something like:
  "Make sure that host has resources to map file pointed by -mem-path"
would be pretty useless.
I think describing how host should be configured in various ways
depending on type of backing storage is well out of scope of any
QEMU documentation. But if you have an idea to what to put there
(or what to put in deprecation doc and refer to from here),
I'll add it on respin.

Using man page language, would be
 'guest startup RAM size'
acceptable?

Maybe
"
 In the future, QEMU will not fall back, but fail instead.
 Adjust either the QEMU configuration by removing @option{-mem-path} so
 QEMU will use only anonymous or host configuration to make sure that
 there are sufficient resources on backing storage pointed by -mem-path
 to allocate amount specified by @option{-m}.
