Renames are always kind of painful. Do we have a real reason for the
rename except that the paths feel a bit long subjectively?

Of course, if we're renaming all files anyway, changing the directory
name at the same time shouldn't give any additional pain, so it would be
completely reasonable then. We're not renaming the test harness files,
though, and even only two test cases in this patch.

Maybe this final patch should stay RFC until we have the infrastructure
in and then we can have a single series that moves all tests and also
renames the directory? Maybe a not strictly necessary rename of the
tooling would be bearable in the context of a mass rename of tests.
