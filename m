Do you mean the following patch?

I've sent some changes to kernel-doc to simplify the implementation of
these changes (http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-doc/msg42354.html) and
they were accepted.  So with 4.10 + those patches, the local changes to
kernel-doc for QEMU would be limited to the following:

which should be maintainable as a fork of Linux's kernel-doc.

I also worked a bit on support for Texinfo manuals in Sphinx.  My
current attempt is at http://people.redhat.com/pbonzini/qemu-test-doc/_bu=
ild/.
Because this uses a Texinfo->Docbook->Sphinx pipeline, I also tried some
tools with native Docbook support (Publican), but despite Sphinx's quirks
the output was less usable, and the tools were slower and harder to use.

http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Features/Documentation is another place to
brainstorm ideas on this.
