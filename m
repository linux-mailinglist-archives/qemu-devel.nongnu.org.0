To just repeat the patch 5 description...

Currently meson registers a single test that invokes an entire group of
I/O tests, hiding the test granularity from meson. There are various
downsides of doing this

 * You cannot ask 'meson test' to invoke a single I/O test
 * The meson test timeout can't be applied to the individual
   tests
 * Meson only gets a pass/fail for the overall I/O test group
   not individual tests
 * Meson can't show the time of individual I/O tests, so we
   can't see why 4-5 are consuming the bulk of the time
   and ripe for optimization
 * If a CI job gets killed by the GitLab timeout, we don't
   get visibility into how far through the I/O tests
   execution got.

This is not really specific to the I/O tests, the problem is common
to any case of us running a test which is in fact another test
harness which runs many tests. It would be nice to have meson have
the full view of all tests run. Adapting the I/O tests is as easy
win in this respect.

This switches meson to perform test discovery by invoking 'check' in
dry-run mode. It then registers one meson test case for each I/O
test. Parallel execution remains disabled since the I/O tests do not
use self contained execution environments and thus conflict with
each other.

A few tweaks were needed to the iotests runner because it had a few
assumptions about it always running in a tree that has already been
built, which is obviously not the case at the time meson does test
discovery.

In v2:

New example pipeline job

   https://gitlab.com/berrange/qemu/-/jobs/3871446106

 * Set build/source dir defaults in CLI option parser
   instead of testenv.py (Alex)
 * Fix messed up termios settings with parallel execution
   by connecting stdin to /dev/null (Thomas)
 * Remove the obsolete check-block.sh script (Thomas)
 * Use a unique sub-directory per test to allow parallelization (Thomas)
 * Enable parallel execution by meson (Thomas)
 * Remove leftover debugging message (Thomas)
 * Use a shorter meson test name 'io-qcow2-012' instead of
   'qemu-iotests-qcow2-012'

Daniel P. Berrang√© (8):
  iotests: explicitly pass source/build dir to 'check' command
  iotests: allow test discovery before building
  iotests: strip subdir path when listing tests
  iotests: print TAP protocol version when reporting tests
  iotests: connect stdin to /dev/null when running tests
  iotests: always use a unique sub-directory per test
  iotests: register each I/O test separately with meson
  iotests: remove the check-block.sh script
