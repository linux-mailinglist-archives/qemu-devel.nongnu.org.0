Ha ha :). That was the whole point. To create a minimal machine that
is easy to maintain and emulate platforms in the real world.

Yes. I already had the patch to fix that in the virt machine in the
cover letter.
I did not send it to the mailing list to avoid confusion.

Yeah. We can move the socket creation to the common code as well.
There are few others small ones (virt_set/get_aia_guests) can be moved
to common code.

In the future, real world hpc machines may just build their machine
on top of this machine instead of developing from scratch if we allow
some configurability
(e.g memory map, machine name, max cpus etc.)

Fair enough. I can rename it to virt-hpc or something similar.
