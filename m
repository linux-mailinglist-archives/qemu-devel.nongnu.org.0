Hmm.  When we get block status, it is very easy to tell that something 
reads as zero when the qcow2 file has the zero bit set, but when the 
qcow2 file does not have the zero bit set, we have to then query the 
format layer whether it reads as zeros (which is expensive enough for 
some format layers that we no longer report things as reading as zero). 
I'm worried that optimizing this case could penalize later block status.

We already can tell the difference between a cluster that has the zero 
bit set but is not preallocated, vs. has the zero bit set and is 
preallocated.  Are we really forcing a copy-on-write to a cluster that 
is marked zero but preallocated?  Is the problem that we don't have a 
way to distinguish between 'reads as zeroes, allocated, but we don't 
know state of format layer' and 'reads as zeroes, allocated, and we know 
format layer reads as zeroes'?

Hmm - just noticing things: how does this series interplay with the 
existing bdrv_has_zero_init_truncate?  Should this series automatically 
handle BDRV_REQ_ZERO_WRITE on a bdrv_co_truncate(PREALLOC_NONE) request 
for all drivers that report true, even if that driver does not advertise 
support for the BDRV_REQ_ZERO_WRITE flag?

Here, ret == -1 does not imply whether errp is set - but annoyingly, 
errp CAN be set if bdrv_co_truncate() failed.

And here, you are passing a possibly-set errp back to 
bdrv_co_truncate().  That is a bug that can abort.  You need to pass 
NULL to the first bdrv_co_truncate() call or else clear errp prior to 
trying a fallback to this second bdrv_co_truncate() call.
