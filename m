Title:
  VNC outputs garbage in zlib mode

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  TL;DR: When QEMU is launched with VNC as the output and viewed with a
  client that defaults to zlib VNC encoding, the resulting output tends
  to accumulate artifacts.

  Reproduction:
  Launch QEMU (tried with versions 4.2.0 and 4.1.0 on Linux  64bit) with -v=
nc 0.0.0.0:0
  Connect to it with a VNC client that allows you to select encoding, i.e. =
UltraVNC.
  Set encoding to zlib (type 6), 32bit color.
  As screen content changes it starts accumulating artifacts. Almost certai=
n to appear if you open-close windows over a pattern.
  Does not seem to depend on guest used, but easier to reproduce with a GUI.

  Looks like this: https://orbides.org/img/vnc.png

  It appears to be a deflate glitch of some sort - all of the bad pixels
  are generated by length/distance codes. Can't narrow it down any more.
