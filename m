A property check callback that needs the property value is a more
complex use case, and would require too much property-type-specific
boilerplate today.  I plan to address it, but not right now.

In my next series that makes static properties usable by any QOM
object, I will add a separate "allow_set" callback to the
internal QOM property API, which will not take the property value
as argument.  This would be enough for the dev->realized checks
that are currently in qdev.

Interestingly, there is only one link property check callback
function in the QEMU tree that actually cares about the property
value: isa_ipmi_bmc_check().  All other cases either don't care
about the property value at all (qdev_prop_allow_set_link_before_realize(),
object_property_allow_set_link()), or are being misused for
something other than property checking (xlnx_dp_set_dpdma()).
