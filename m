OK, so:

patches 1 & 2:
Reviewed-by: Philippe Mathieu-Daudé <philmd@redhat.com>

Peter, can you apply them?

Sorry if I made things more complex. I went on PTO after sending
"hw/arm: Use object_initialize_child for correct reference counting" [*]
then was slow to address Thomas/Markus comments.
Then maybe I should start pinging maintainer more aggressively when my
series are reviewed but not merged, to not delay further developments.

I took note of your comment and will try to keep things simple the next
time.

Regards,

Phil.
