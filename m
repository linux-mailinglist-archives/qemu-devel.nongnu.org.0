I was going to defend what I was doing here but then, reading PAPR yet again:

"The legal form of the “ibm,associativity” property is dependent upon the
setting of the “ibm,architecture-vec-5” property byte 5 bit 0. The bit value
of zero (...) this form is being deprecated for new implementations in favor
of the form indicated by the “ibm,architecture-vec-5” property byte 5 bit 0
having the value of one in which the “ibm,associativity” property string
***represents the strict physical hierarchy of the platform***".

My defense was going to be that I'm not cascading all levels larger than
n_level because I would be inferring topology, when I should be inferring
just performance distance. Apparently this is wrong and we should represent
physical hierarchy, and what you're proposing is the right way to do it.
I'll fix it in v4.
