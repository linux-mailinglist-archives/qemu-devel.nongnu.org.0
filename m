FWIW I tested Finn kernel and QEMU part following:
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg667432.html
to check than its series doesn't introduce regressions, booting Linux=20
and NetBSD.
I haven't run the thorough networking tests Laurent do with the q800=20
(scp of big files, fetch over http in loop).

Herv=C3=A9 testing is welcomed, but as a hobbyist he doesn't spend more tha=
n=20
1h every 2 months on this, so I don't think his approval is a blocker.
We are not talking about business critical emulation, so we can fix=20
regressions on top.

That said, I'm spending some hobby time on a Magnum boot code to be able=20
to test the board upstream (without depending on proprietary BIOS and=20
painful graphical setup).

Currently I get NetBSD to kdb and Linux get stuck there:
