I don't know anything about HV and running it nested but I'm sure pegasos2 
does not run with it as the hardware does not have HV (or radix MMU which 
is mentioned in the commit message above) and I've only used vhyp here to 
avoid having to modify vof and be able to use the same vof.bin that we 
have. This was the simplest way but it probably does not work with KVM 
either so I agree that unless it's required to implement this method for 
all machines using vhyp then this should not be needed for pegasos2. We 
only really need hypercall to be able to use VOF which is needed for 
booting OSes as the board firmware is not redistributable.

If this gets in the way we could replace it with some other hypercall 
method (there was some discussion during the review of the series adding 
VOF support to pegasos2, we could support MOL OSI or some own solution 
instead) if VOF supported these, but I did not want to touch VOF so went 
with the simplest working solution.
