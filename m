Hi,

When trying to boot an linux kernel with

qemu-system-aarch64 -s -S -kernel /path/to/kernel -append
"console=ttyAMA0 loglevel=9 nokaslr" -dtb /path/to/dtb -M vexpress-a15 -cpu cortex-a53 -nographic

I do hit the assertion:
qemu-system-aarch64: /builddir/build/BUILD/qemu-4.2.1/hw/arm/boot.c:742: do_cpu_reset: Assertion `!info->secure_boot' failed.

which seems to come from this commit:
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  745)                     /* AArch64 kernels never boot in secure mode */
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  746)                     assert(!info->secure_boot);
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  747)                     /* This hook is only supported for AArch32 currently:
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  748)                      * bootloader_aarch64[] will not call the hook, and
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  749)                      * the code above has already dropped us into EL2 or EL1.
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  750)                      */
43118f4351c hw/arm/boot.c (Peter Maydell          2018-03-13  751)                     assert(!info->secure_board_setup);

So I did try to boot with "-machine secure=off" which makes the kernel
boot (at least a bit...), but it also seems to drop EL3 support in vexpress.c:

        if (!secure) {
            object_property_set_bool(cpuobj, "has_el3", false, NULL);
        }

which triggers arm/cpu.c:

    if (!cpu->has_el3) {
        /* If the has_el3 CPU property is disabled then we need to disable the
         * feature.
         */
        unset_feature(env, ARM_FEATURE_EL3);

my kernel then tries to determine the secure state by issuing a SCM
instruction, which leads to an undefined exception because no EL3 is
available, see arm/target/op_helper.c:

    if (!arm_feature(env, ARM_FEATURE_EL3) &&
        cpu->psci_conduit != QEMU_PSCI_CONDUIT_SMC) {
        /* If we have no EL3 then SMC always UNDEFs and can't be
         * trapped to EL2. PSCI-via-SMC is a sort of ersatz EL3
         * firmware within QEMU, and we want an EL2 guest to be able
         * to forbid its EL1 from making PSCI calls into QEMU's
         * "firmware" via HCR.TSC, so for these purposes treat
         * PSCI-via-SMC as implying an EL3.
         * This handles the very last line of the previous table.
         */
        raise_exception(env, EXCP_UDEF, syn_uncategorized(),
                        exception_target_el(env));
    }

which leads the kernel to call die()

So may question is:
is above assert wrong? Is this a bug?

I think the assert in above commit tries to prevent the boot in secure
state (vs non-secure state/NS), but I think there is a mix-up between secure state and EL3
support?

what do you think?

bug or feature?

please be gentle as I'm fairly new to qemu and aarch64 :-)

with kind regards
thomas
