I don=92t know whether that=92s a good point.  We have strong restrictions
on @replaces anyway (that=92s the point of this series, to fix them).  So
if we want to loosen those restrictions and allow the user to do
anything they want because it=92s their job to be careful, that would be a
whole different series.

Also, one of the examples in the commit message is using @replaces with
drive-mirror sync=3Dnone mode=3Dabsolute-paths.  @replaces must be a child
of the source.  So what will happen is that it=92s replaced and then we
can=92t attach the source as the backing file of the target.  So the
target will probably just read garbage, given that it now lacks the
source as its backing file.

So I=92m not sold on =93If the user knows what=92ll happen, it=92s all good=
=94.
Because I don=92t think they=92ll really know.  I=92d rather keep it tight
until someone complains.
