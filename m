No, that's the public API, not the internals which we're poking at.

We do require that we have one that's new enough, so in future it might
be possible; but we're currently using very new parts of fuse.
(It's also not obvious whether the kernel or libfuse owns the 'newest'
version of that header; we think it's probably the kernel).
