I wouldn't say this is an unofficial draft. v0.7.1 is an official and
tagged draft spec.

It is a draft spec and there is a new version (v0.8.0) and eventually
there will be a full (not draft release).

The current plan (for all draft extensions) is to support just the
latest draft in QEMU. That is QEMU will have experimental support for
draft extension x at v0.1. When draft extension x is updated to v0.2
we will update the QEMU implementation (when we can) and only support
the v0.2.

We will continue updating and supporting the latest until the final
spec release, in which case we will then maintain the feature
following QEMU's deprecation policy.

While the spec is in a draft state the feature will be considered
experimental (hence the subject to change).

This way we can support and enable users to test on draft extensions,
but not spend all our time supporting draft extensions.

That is generally the plan. When the final spec comes out this will be
updated and we will only support that.

I agree that would be nice, but that is a lot of extra maintenance to
support a draft spec.

Considering most other projects won't accept draft specs I don't see
the huge appeal to maintain draft specs.
