True.

But there=E2=80=99s nothing that inherently binds it to FUSE, so I think bo=
th
from an implementation=E2=80=99s POV and from a user=E2=80=99s POV, it look=
s just as
generic as =E2=80=9Cwritable=E2=80=9D.  But that=E2=80=99s theory.  I agree=
 that in practice, it
won=E2=80=99t be as generic.

(I realize this doesn=E2=80=99t help much in finding out what we should do.=
)

Yes, I asked because I=E2=80=99m wondering whether it would be more cumbers=
ome
to users if we didn=E2=80=99t keep it in the base structure.

The duplication depends on how we want to design the command.  Should
the export implementations receive a ready-to-use BB?  Or just a
node-name?  In the latter case, we wouldn=E2=80=99t get rid of duplicated c=
ode
by having writable/growable in the base.  For the former, it could, but
then again, just taking the WRITE permission and making the BB growable
isn=E2=80=99t that bad to duplicate.

Something to consider is that of course the current NBD code wants a
node-name and not a BB.  So if we decided to generally give export
implementations a BB, then the initial implementation of
qmp_block_export_add() would look a bit freaky: It would first branch
off to qmp_nbd_server_add(), and then open the BB for the =E2=80=9Ccommon=
=E2=80=9D case,
but this common case only exists for FUSE (right now).

OTOH, right now we=E2=80=99re free to decide whether we open the BB in
qmp_block_export_add() or fuse.c, and so we might as well just do it in
the former.  If we later find out that this was a stupid idea, we can
always move it into fuse.c.


Now I don=E2=80=99t quite know where I=E2=80=99m trying to get with this.

I suppose it means that we should start with qmp_block_export_add()
creating the BB and handing it over to the export implementation.

Then it makes sense to me that the BB should be ready to go, i.e. have
all the necessary flags and permissions set.  If so, writable and
growable should be part of the base, so the WRITE permission can be
taken and allow_write_beyond_eof can be set.

But there=E2=80=99s a catch: The common code actually cannot pass on a
ready-to-go BB, because it depends on the export type what kinds of
permissions can be shared.  FUSE exports are fine with sharing the
RESIZE permission, but NBD can=E2=80=99t do that.  And, well, if we require=
 the
export implementation to adjust the permissions anyway, we might as well
require it to take WRITE if necessary.  And then the argument for
avoiding duplication is gone.

That=E2=80=99s too bad. ;-)

I was mostly asking because I imagine it would actually make more sense
to add block-export-add in a seperate (prerequisite) series.
