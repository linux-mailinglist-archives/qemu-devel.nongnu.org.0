Yeah, I don't like the name of that one either (or of "disable-modern" 
or "disable-legacy") but I don't follow qemu-devel closely so I didn't 
see them when their patches went by. But now is my chance to complain :-)

I can live with it either way, but still think it's much better to not 
have "negative" option names. Feel free to ignore, and I'll just be 
happy that I didn't accept it silently.

Also, is there a rhyme/reason for some options having true/false, and 
some being off/on? disable-acs seems to be true/false, but 
disable-modern is on/off. Doesn't make any difference to me in the end, 
but just thought I'd bring it up in case there might be a reason to use 
on/off instead of true/false for this one.
