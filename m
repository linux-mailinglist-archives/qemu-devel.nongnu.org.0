I guess this matches a command sent through the SMMUv3 command queue
(CMD_PRI_RESP) that should be trapped by QEMU and injected to the
physical SMMU, right?

I think everybody misses that injection path and that's not specific to
virtio-iommu. PRS is not currently addressed by in-flight Intel's kernel
series ([PATCH V9 00/10] Nested Shared Virtual Address (SVA) VT-d
support) either.

I think the topic is complex enough to separate the concerns and try to
move forward in incremental steps hence my efforts to push for simple
nested use case. Can't you support vSVA without PRS first (I think this
Intel's strategy too)

OK.

From the above arguments I am not sure there are technical blockers with
nested paging implementation. For sure there are things that are not
supported, because I did not address this topic yet.

If I were to work on this, you did not answer bout the testing feasibility.
