Indeed, it is both data-dependent (how sparse is the source) and 
target-dependent (does the reduced I/O from a single pre-zeroing pass 
outweigh the time spent on non-zero portions).  I'm fine with dropping 
this optimization, as we do not have proper heuristics to reliably 
detect when it is actually going to be a win.  (It would be nice if we 
_could_ have reliable heuristics, but that's a story for another day)
