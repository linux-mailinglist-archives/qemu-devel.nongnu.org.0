Hi,

Applying Maxim’s series for LUKS encryption slot management through
qemu-img amend / blockdev-amend has brought a – on the first glance –
rather minor problem: It changes the order of qcow2’s creation options,
which results in some reference output changes (patch 5:
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2020-06/msg00335.html
).  This affects some tests that can also run with other image formats,
such as qcow, whose order does not change.  So this patch breaks those
tests (I’ve seen it for 134 and 158) when run with a different format
than qcow2 (e.g. qcow).

Now we could just create a difference reference output for qcow2, as is
done e.g. for test 150.  But that would not only be boring, but also not
really sustainable: The actual problem is that the order of creation
options simply does not have to be the same between different image
formats, and so we should not just dump qemu-img create’s output to a
reference output, drop some format-specific options and expect it to
work independent of the format for which the test is run.

So patch 1 in this series makes _filter_img_create sort the creation
options as they appear in the “Formatting” line, so it’s always the same
order between formats.  (And I took this opportunity to also reverse the
filtering implementation from denylisting to allowlisting.)

Patch 2 is taken from Maxim’s series and modified to fit the new
implementation.

I propose putting this series underneath Maxim’s series (in my block
branch) so the latter won’t break 134 and 158 for qcow.  (Doing so will
require dropping some hunks from the patch linked above, but that should
be fine.)
