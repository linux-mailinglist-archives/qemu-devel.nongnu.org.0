I think the important point to understand here is that implicit filters
are a concept to maintain compatibility with legacy (pre-blockdev)
management tools which simply don't manage stuff on the node level. So
changing the structure of the graph is not a problem for them and we
just need to make sure that when they do something with a BlockBackend,
we perform the action on the node that they actually mean.

Modern management tools are expected to manage the graph on a node level
and to assign node names to everything.

Note that libvirt is close to becoming a modern management tool, so it's
probably a good idea to now make all block jobs add filters where we'll
need them in the long run.

I actually changed my opinion on how to do this since we introduced
implicit filters. I know think that the right way to move forward is to
make sure that the copy-on-read filter can do everything it needs to do,
and then just completely deprecate -drive copy-on-read=3Don instead of
adding compatibility magic to turn it into an implicit copy-on-read
filter internally.

That's why we shouldn't do that, but just remove copy-on-read=3Don. :-)

Depends, the target could have the source as its backing file (like
fleecing, but without exporting it right now), and then you could always
have a consistent view on the target. Well, almost.

Almost because to guarantee this, we'd have to flush between each CBW
and the corresponding write to the same block, to make sure that the old
data is backed up before it is overwritten.

Of course, this would perform about as badly as internal COW in qcow2...
So probably not a guarantee we should be making by default. But it might
make sense as an option.
