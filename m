Not sure we really have some locality difference between cold/warm
resets. I think, most generally, locality of reset is on a per-device
scale with different grouping level (up to the whole system). But buses
are not always the way things are grouped.

Inside a soc (and microcontrollers in general) it follows more the clock
tree than the internal bus tree. For example on the the machine I worked
here (xilinx-zynq-a9) and, you can control by software the reset of
basically every single device and the bus too (but resetting the bus
does not reset devices on it).

On the other hand, there is some buses, like pci, which explicitly
defines some bus reset mechanism with differences between cold and warm
(some registers keep their values). (see
https://wiki.qemu.org/Features/ResetAPI)

Regarding cold reset, if a soc supports some power gating, you'll
probably have non-global cold reset in the process.

Do you mean "real world" example ?
