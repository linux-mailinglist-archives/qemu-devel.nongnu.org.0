TL is a target-specific type that does not necessarily correspond to uint64_t,
as you assume in the print message.  More importantly, on a 32-bit host with a
64-bit guest, this movi will generate *two* ops...

... which means that this operation does not do what you think it does.  It
will only set one (unknown) half of the _i64 temporary.

Moreover, this isn't quite as zero overhead as I would like, because the pc_end
temporary is always created, even if the trace_tb condition is not satisfied
and so it (eventually) gets removed as unused.

I'm not quite sure what you're after with pc_end anyway.  As you note within
the cover, you can't reliably use it for anything.  If you remove that, then
you've also removed all of the other problems with this patch.
