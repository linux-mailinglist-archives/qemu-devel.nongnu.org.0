By anyone outside the coroutine itself. Maybe just dropping the word
"externally" avoids the confusion because it's an implementation detail
that the coroutine can schedule itself while it is marked busy.

> Also mention how it changes from true to false?

Somethin like: "The coroutine will automatically change it back to false
after processing all pending requests"?

Any specific reason why comments (but not code) in this file use a
different text width than everything else in QEMU? My editor is set to
use 80 characters to conform to CODING_STYLE.rst.

Both run in the same thread anyway, so barriers wouldn't make a
difference.

Yes, it's for synchronisation with the monitor thread. A coroutine may
not be scheduled twice at the same time. This is essentially all that
we're protecting against with qmp_dispatcher_co_busy. (See the
documentation for qmp_dispatcher_co_busy above.)

atomic_mb_set/read() contain a barrier, which avoids reordering around
them. What makes them weaker than sequentially consistent atomic
operations is, quoting docs/devel/atomics.txt:

    However, and this is the important difference between
    atomic_mb_read/atomic_mb_set and sequential consistency, it is importan=
t
    for both threads to access the same volatile variable.  It is not the
    case that everything visible to thread A when it writes volatile field =
f
    becomes visible to thread B after it reads volatile field g. The store
    and load have to "match" (i.e., be performed on the same volatile
    field) to achieve the right semantics.

This condition is fulfilled, both threads communicate only through
qmp_dispatcher_co_busy.

Correct.

This pending work specifically contains running the monitor dispatcher
coroutine. Without the aio_poll(), the coroutine code wouldn't get a
chance to run, so we would never complete.

Note that AIO_WAIT_WHILE() automatically polls the (main) AioContext of
the thread, but the main thread is irregular in that it has two
AioContexts. The monitor dispatcher happens to live in the iohandler
context, which is not polled by default, so we need to do that manually.

I'm not sure myself how much of this is actually still true, but not
being an expert on iohandler_ctx myself, I decided to leave things in
the same AioContext where they were before this series.

What will happen here is essentially that we schedule a BH that enters
the coroutine. This runs the first part of monitor_qmp_dispatcher_co()
until it yields because there are no requests pending yet.

monitor_qmp_requests_pop_any_with_lock() is the only thing that is run
before handle_qmp_command() wakes up the coroutine (or monitor_cleanup
if we never get any request).

If this is true, we could replace this line:

    aio_co_schedule(iohandler_get_aio_context(), qmp_dispatcher_co);

with the following one:

    qemu_aio_coroutine_enter(iohandler_get_aio_context(), qmp_dispatcher_co=
);

I'm not sure that this is any simpler.

Then you would ask me why the exchange has to be atomic. :-)

More practically, I would need a temporary variable so that I don't get
code with side effects in assert() (which may be compiled out with
NDEBUG). The temporary variable would never be read outside the assert
and would be unused with NDEBUG.

So possible, yes, cleaner I'm not sure.

Yes. I understood "busy" in the sense of "executing a monitor command",
but of course the purpose of the variable is to know whether you need to
schedule the coroutine or whether you must not schedule it.

Yes, do_qmp_dispatch_bh is scheduled immediately before yielding, so
that yield is where the coroutine will be resumed.

I think I prefer explicitly mentioning that these callers not only push
requests or request shutdown, but that they actively cause this
coroutine to be reentered.

Matter of taste. You're the maintainer, so your taste wins.

Nested event loops (i.e. AIO_WAIT_WHILE) poll qemu_aio_context, so if we
are scheduled there, the next iteration of the monitor dispatcher loop
could start from a nested event loop. If we are scheduled in
iohandler_ctx, then only the actual main loop will reenter the coroutine
and nested event loops ignore it.

I'm not sure if or why this is actually important, but this matches
scheduling the dispatcher BH in iohandler_ctx in the code before this
patch.

If we didn't do this, we could end up starting monitor requests in more
places than before, and who knows what that would mean.
