My knowledge of this code is fairly limited, so correct me if I am wrong.

blk_set_aio_context() would set the context for the block aio. AFAICT, 
the only aio for the block is xen_block_complete_aio().

In the stack above, we are not dealing with a block aio but an aio tie 
to the event channel (see the call from xen_device_poll). So I don't 
think the blk_set_aio_context() would affect the aio.

So it would be possible to get the iothread running because we received 
a notification on the event channel while we are stopping the block (i.e 
xen_block_dataplane_stop()).

If xen_block_dataplane_stop() grab the context lock first, then the 
iothread dealing with the event may wait on the lock until its released.

By the time the lock is grabbed, we may have free all the resources 
(including srings). So the event iothread will end up to dereference a 
NULL pointer.

It feels to me we need a way to quiesce all the iothreads (blk, 
event,...) before continuing. But I am a bit unsure how to do this in QEMU.

Cheers,
