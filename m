apicid was composed from socket/core/thread[/die] tuple which cpus[i].props=
 is.

Question is if we can compose only pkg_id based on the same data without
converting it to apicid and then "reverse engineering" it back
original data?

Or more direct question: is socket-id the same as pkg_id?

I suggest to drop that patch, It's the one that touches generic numa
code and adding more legacy based extensions like cpu_indexes.
Which I'd like to get rid of to begin with, so only -numa cpu is left.

I think it's not necessary to touch numa code at all for apicid generation
purpose, as I tried to explain above. We should be able to keep
this x86 only business.

what handlers do you mean?

I'm not sure what do you mean here.

If you have something to share and can push it on github,
I can look at, whether it has design issues to spare you a round trip on a =
list.
(it won't be proper review but at least I can help to pinpoint most problem=
atic parts)
