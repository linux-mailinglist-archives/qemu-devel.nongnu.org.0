AFAIU the major users of the vIOMMU should be guest DPDK apps and
nested device assignments.  For these users I would just make bold to
guess they are mostly using Linux so the majority should be safe.

For the minority, I do agree that above question is valid.  IMHO the
hard point is to find out those users and let them join the
discussion, then we can know how many will be affected and how.  I
think one way to achieve it could be that we merge the patchset like
this, then people will start to complain if there is any. :) I'm not
sure whether that's the best way to go.  I think that could still be a
serious option considering that it could potentially fix a more severe
issue (unexpected QEMU quits), and also reverting the patchset like
this one could be easy as well when really necessary (e.g., the
patchset will not bring machine state changes which might cause
migration issues, or so on).

This is an interesting view at least to me, while... I'm not sure we
should allow that even for emulation.  I'm just imaging such a patch
for the Linux kernel to allow failures on enabling DMAR - it'll be
only for QEMU emulation and I'm not sure whether upstream would like
such a patch.  After all, we are emulating the hardwares, and the
hardware will always succeed in enabling DMAR, AFAICT.  For Windows
and other OSs it could be even harder.  If without the support of all
these, we could simply have other risks of having hanging guests when
the driver is busy waiting for the DMAR status bit to be set.

Agreed.  So far, a stricter rule could be a bit better than a hanging
guest to me.  Though that could be very subjective.

Thanks!
