Well, that LCHS change happens because you move the guest from vmware to
qemu and seabios uses 63 spt no matter what if the disk is too big for
chs addressing.

When seabios is changed to look at the MBR to figure what the lchs of
the disk is that will make your guest boot.

Sure, if the guess is wrong then the guest will not boot.  That isn't
worse than the situation we have today where seabios will not even try
to figure what the lchs of the disk is.

And, no, downgrading seabios will not make your vmware guest with 56 spt
boot.

cheers,
  Gerd
