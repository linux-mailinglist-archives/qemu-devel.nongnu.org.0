Please do.

In general, QMP prefers the plain units over arbitrary multiples,
e.g. Byte, not Mebibyte.  Sadly, many violations of this rule have crept
in.

More complete documentation should help us determine the unit we want
here.

Here's the documentation we generate for query-gic-capabilities:

 -- Command: query-gic-capabilities

     This command is ARM-only.  It will return a list of GICCapability
     objects that describe its capability bits.

     Returns: a list of GICCapability objects.

     Since: 2.6

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "query-gic-capabilities" }
          <- { "return": [{ "version": 2, "emulated": true, "kernel": false },
                          { "version": 3, "emulated": false, "kernel": true } ] }

     If: 'defined(TARGET_ARM)'

The "If:" line is generated from the schema's condition.  It's not as
readable as I'd like it to be, but it's there, and it always matches the
code.

"This command is ARM-only" is redundant.  Escaped review.  A patch to
drop it would be welcome.

Took me a few seconds to connect this to my "# Query valid SVE vector
length sets." line %-}
