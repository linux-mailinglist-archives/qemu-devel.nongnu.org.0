=E2=80=9CEasier to use=E2=80=9D in my opinion would be if it never fails, b=
ut the
question is whether that=E2=80=99s also the most useful approach.

I think it should match what I thought when @bitmaps should be reported,
i.e. it should be accepted whenever the target format (and qemu-img
convert, obviously) supports bitmaps.  I don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=99=
s value in
aborting just because the source doesn=E2=80=99t have bitmaps.  What=E2=80=
=99s the user
going to do in response?  =E2=80=9COops, thanks, qemu-img, I accidentally t=
ried
to convert the wrong image=E2=80=9D?

(Whereas if we reject --bitmaps because the target format doesn=E2=80=99t
support it, there=E2=80=99s actually value, because the user is reminded th=
at
they should choose a different target format.)

=E2=80=9CWhich is easier=E2=80=9D is misleading, because both are actually =
trivial.
Adding three numbers is what a computer does best.

It=E2=80=99s a question of style, not of =E2=80=9Cwhich is easier=E2=80=9D.

Sounds good to me, but then again, calling a command to see whether it
fails isn=E2=80=99t exactly hard either.

So it remains a question of style to me.

From my perspective, measure is a query function similar to info.  It
should return all information that=E2=80=99s trivial to obtain.  Switches t=
o
select what information to return how only make sense when that optional
information is hard to obtain (think qemu-img info --backing-chain).

Switches make sense on data-modifying operations like convert.  Not so
much for querying operations, because why not just return all
information you have and let the caller sort it out?

I would hope that programs consuming qemu-img measure=E2=80=99s output use
--output=3Djson, and then you definitely can=E2=80=99t just ignore the QAPI=
 object
definition.

Furthermore, I don=E2=80=99t like that 2-form at all, for two reasons.  Fir=
st,
again, I can=E2=80=99t see a reasonable QAPI definition to match it; and se=
cond,
I don=E2=80=99t like it as a consistent interface.  We should decide on one
thing and do that.  Either you need to pass --bitmaps to make them
included in required, or they aren=E2=80=99t in the output at all.

The way you propose it with this 2-form approach makes --bitmap make
qemu-img be a calculator.   But why?  It=E2=80=99s absolutely trivial for
consumers to:

irb(main):002:1` result =3D JSON.parse(`./qemu-img measure --output=3Djson =
\
irb(main):003:0>                                 -O qcow2 src.qcow2`)
irb(main):004:0* result['required'] +
irb(main):005:0>   (result['bitmaps'] ? result['bitmaps'] : 0)
=3D> 524288

(Example in Ruby, but I don=E2=80=99t think that matters much.)

There is no value in qemu-img optionally performing that operation for
the caller.  Adding two integers is the simplest thing there is.
