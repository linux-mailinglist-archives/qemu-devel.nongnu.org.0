The Linux kernel interface is low level and not the way any userspace
application exposes the use of abstract sockets. No one wants to
specify an abstract socket by listing all 108 characters with many
trailing nuls. It would be insane to do this.

There are two ways userspace apps expose abstract socket config.

Either using a leading "@" as a magic substitute for NUL and not
supporting a coibfigurable way to distinguish truncated vs full
length, just define the desired behaviour for their app. THis is
what dbus does to denote its abstract socket paths.

Or, just or by having  explicit flags "abstract" and "tight" to
control the behaviour.  The latter is what 'socat' does to allow
use of abstract sockets.

For QEMU the former approach gives broad interoperabiltiy with
userspace applications, so made more sense than using magic "@".

The interface doesn't need fixing - the way it is represented in
QEMU is much saner than the low level struct sockaddr_un representation
used to talk to the kernel, and is common with other userspace apps.

The use case is to enable interoperability with other apps that use
an abstract socket.
