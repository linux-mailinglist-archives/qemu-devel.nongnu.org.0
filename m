Makes sense (see my point about "allowing some [whipuptitude] in QMP"),
except I disagree with your example:

This commmand does have a QMP equivalent: query-block.

Hmm, no more.  It actually wraps around both query-block and
query-named-block-nodes now.  I think that makes it an example of "go
beyond 1:1".

A better example for "allowing whipuptitude" would be "info registers".

Yes.
