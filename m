We may be able to avoid this problem if we identify what the driver needs=
=20
from the BIOS and implement that in our vgabios. Gerd has already added=20
some tables that some drivers need in the latest vgabios version that's=20
currently in git master (but those were for Rage128 and RV100 that ati-vg=
a=20
currently implements). Aaron, did you try with latest git master and does=
=20
that still need a BIOS from a real card or if so do you happen to know=20
what the driver needs from the BIOS? (It may be some tables/structure or=20
BIOS calls that the QEMU vgabios-ati does not implement yet.) If that's=20
not too difficult to add it may be implemented in QEMU's vgabios to avoid=
=20
needing proprietary blobs. It could also be EDID access that may use=20
different registers on R300 but I think that may be simple to fix if more=
=20
details are known.

I don't know but this may be similar to boards needing firmware ROMs or=20
the firmware blobs needed by some Linux kernel drivers. How are those
handled? Distros usually put them in a non-free repo I think.
