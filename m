The issue with security is not unique to EDK2. Essentially all the
binary blob firmwares that QEMU distributes have this problem, since
we dont update any of them in response to upstream security issues
in any reliable timeframe.  EDK2 is probably most dangerous since
its code base is relatively larger than other firmwares, but they
are all essentially doomed.

This is why distros should generall ybuild as many of the ROMs as
possible from scratch using latest available upstream source, not
what QEMU distributes.

I wish we would actually ship a qemu tarball which excluded all the
pre-built ROMs and bundle them in a separate add-on tarball, with a
warning that they shouldn't be used in any "virtualization" use case
in production, only for non-virtualization use cases, as described in

  https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/security.html

because the latter is where security does not matter.

Daniel
