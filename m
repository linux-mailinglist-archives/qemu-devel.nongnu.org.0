Error handling is not the best in the audio subsystem, if something 
fails it generally just prints a warning to the console and continues, 
and something will happen...  For example, this is what happens when I 
try to open one hw device twice. I ran qemu with:

-audiodev 
alsa,id=foo,in.dev=hw:1,,0,out.mixing-engine=off,out.dev=hw:1,,0 -device 
piix4-usb-uhci -device usb-audio,audiodev=foo -device AC97,audiodev=foo

When the guest tried to initialize the AC97 card, I got an error:

alsa: Could not initialize DAC
alsa: Failed to open `hw:1,0':
alsa: Reason: Device or resource busy

And it just continued. And the sound worked, but with wrong sample rate 
(AC97 wants 44100 Hz, but USB audio previously opened the alsa device 
with 48000 Hz).  I'll fix this bug in the next revision, 
audio_pcm_hw_add_* shouldn't fall back to other HWs without mixeng.  But 
even with that, the result will be that one emulated sound card will 
work and the other won't.

It's not ideal, but fixing it would require a lot of effort.  Right now, 
if you specify an invalid audiodev for alsa (even with mixeng), it'll 
just print an error to the console and continue without audio.

I think it is.  It depends on the backend, its settings, the frontend 
(emulated sound card), and how the guest uses it.  We currently don't 
know what formats does a backend support, what formats can a frontend 
produce, and even if we would know that, just because a frontend can 
produce a format that the backend doesn't understand doesn't mean that 
it will actually do it.  For example, right now with this patch series 
applied, usb-audio can produce 7.1 audio.  If we want to be strict, it 
means we can only use it with backends that support at least 8 channels, 
even if the user only wants to use stereo audio.

I think we should rather list known working configurations, and leave 
the others as "try at your own risk" because there's too many things 
that can go wrong.  (pulseaudio will work, alsa with dmix too.  Need to 
check coreaudio, dsound and oss.  spice and wavcapture won't work.)
