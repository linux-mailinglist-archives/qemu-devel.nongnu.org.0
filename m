Title:
  Windows 10 very slow with OVMF

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Debian Buster

  Kernel 4.19.0-9-amd64
  qemu-kvm 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u5
  ovmf 0~20181115.85588389-3+deb10u1

  Machine: Thinkpad T470, i7-7500u, 20GB RAM
  VM: 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, Broadwell-noTSX CPU Model

  Windows 10, under this VM, seems to be exceedingly slow with all
  operations. This is a clean install with very few services running.
  Task Manager can take 30% CPU looking at an idle system.
