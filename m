The reason I'm asking to not add new properties here is that it
expands interface visible/used by management tools and it's maintenance
burden not only on QEMU but on engagement side as well. So if yo can reuse
node-id, it will work out of box with existing users.

It should also be less confusing for us since we don't have to keep in mind
(or figure out) that llc_id is the same as node id and wonder why the later
wasn't used in the first place.
