I partially agree here - I see difference between disabling
config and omitting it. We are not not disabling CONFIG_SEMIHOSTING,
we just ignore it. So we got error because it is not properly handled.
Proper handling should be either auto-include it as dependency or
successful build with option disabled.

As there's currently no way to auto-include it through dependency,
it would be good to have comment in default_config file next to it stating
that it's required option. This will allow us to see it and
add to our default_config we used instead upstream one.
