Hi, Jason

We had a discussion about dirty page tracking in VFIO, when vIOMMU
is enabled:

https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-09/msg02690.html

It's actually a similar model as vhost - Qemu cannot interpose the fast-pat=
h
DMAs thus relies on the kernel part to track and report dirty page informat=
ion.
Currently Qemu tracks dirty pages in GFN level, thus demanding a translatio=
n
from IOVA to GPA. Then the open in our discussion is where this translation
should happen. Doing the translation in kernel implies a device iotlb flavo=
r,
which is what vhost implements today. It requires potentially large trackin=
g
structures in the host kernel, but leveraging the existing log_sync flow in=
 Qemu.
On the other hand, Qemu may perform log_sync for every removal of IOVA
mapping and then do the translation itself, then avoiding the GPA awareness
in the kernel side. It needs some change to current Qemu log-sync flow, and=
=20
may bring more overhead if IOVA is frequently unmapped.

So we'd like to hear about your opinions, especially about how you came
down to the current iotlb approach for vhost.=20

p.s. Alex's comment is also copied here from original thread.

Thanks
