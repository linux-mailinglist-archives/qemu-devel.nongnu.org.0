Trying to redo this as something more reasonable.
Problem that I was trying to do is being sure that we know in what state
we are.  Real migration states are:

- NOT_STARTED: We haven't even started
- SETUP: We have started with local stuff but haven't yet transmitted
  anything
- ACTIVE: Migration is donig well, we are trasnmitting data
- FINISHED: We have finished migration (COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED/CANCELLI=
NG)
- COLO: Yet a completelly different can of worms

To make things even more interesting, we export ->state, so code can do
whatever they want with that variable.

What do we need in a lot of places:
- migration_is_running() (i.e. channel is still open).

And we go left and right to be sure what is going on.

As said, I will try to move that to inside migrate_set_state()

thanks, Juan.
