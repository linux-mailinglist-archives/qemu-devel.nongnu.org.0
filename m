I guess, the likelihood of this happening would be similar to
reintroducing other features, such as osxsave or ospke, right?

The domain XML does not contain a complete list of all CPU features.
Features which are implicitly included in a CPU model are not listed in
the XML. Count in the differences in libvirt's vs QEMU's definitions of
a particular CPU model and you can see feat=off cannot be mechanically
dropped from the command line as the CPU model itself could turn it on
by default and thus feat=off is not redundant.
