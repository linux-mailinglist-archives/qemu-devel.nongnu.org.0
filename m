Without another encoding on horizon, it looks like over-engineering.
So lets think of a more generic approach later when need arises.

That's where I disagree, generating APIC ID and it's assignment
shouldn't be part of CPU model. On real machines it's done by
board/firmware, there board is purpose build for specific CPU.

The same should be in QEMU case, where universal QEMU board
adapts its APIC initialization to used CPU and not other way
around (i.e. it's not CPU's job to generate IDs).
So hooks in machine look like a good approach to me.

I's fine to add small helper to CPU code to help board decide
what APIC encoding to use, but I strongly disagree in putting
more logic/data than that into CPU model.

What CPU does inside (I mean CPUID handling) it's separate
business and in that case CPU usually knows what it's encoding
and can use epyc/non_epyc functions directly if necessary.
