Right, thanks for the more detailed explanation of what I was trying to say above.

As you say having helpers can definitely help avoid repetitive code, however there
was a case a few releases back when someone flipped a qdev property in a device
_init() helper function used to initialise one of the more common devices and it
broke several of the older machines.

So now I'm mainly of the opinion that if the helper is just instantiating a device,
setting qdev properties and then returning the device then you're better off moving
the initialisation into the board code to prevent problems like this occurring again
(and certainly this nudges us towards building machines from config files since all
the configuration/wiring is now done at board level).


ATB,

Mark.
