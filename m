I can see a use case for making it easier for developers to build test
cases otherwise everyone has their own particular variant of the kernel
and buildroot/busybox which they have in their own farm. However as
Cleber has noted they make poor standardised tests given the variation
in kernel builds you can get.

That said I think there are better targets. kvm-unit-tests can be built
against a range of architectures and are fashioned as individual unit
tests for specific functionality. It would be useful to make it easy for
a developer to regenerate the test assets to re-run a test someone else
has found to fail.
