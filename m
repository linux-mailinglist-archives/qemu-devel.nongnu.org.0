Thanks a lot . I will do it at my earliest convenience this night.
Haswell i4770 is installed on small server 32 GB. Department's policy
doesn't allow me to test Ubuntu whichever release on bare metal.  I
could test only on outdated CPU's box and it seems to be a core reason.

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
