Indeed that's the usage. I don't have a strong preference. Juan, Dave,
what do you prefer? keep it as it is or introduce unions?

if the key_vmsd is a VMSTATE_UINT32_V then I understand
vmstate_save_state(f, capsule->key_vmsd, key, capsule->vmdesc)
expects key to be a pointer to a uint32. But in that case of direct key,
it is a uint32. I don't figure out how to use vmstate_save_state in your
proposal.

Depending on the clarification of above point, maybe I can rename
VMSTATE_GTREE_DIRECT_KEY_V into VMSTATE_GTREE_DIRECT_UINT_KEY_V

direct keys seem to be more common for hash tables actually.
https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Hash-Tables.html#g-hash-table-new-full

There are stand conversion macros to/from int, uint, size
https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Type-Conversion-Macros.html

Thanks
