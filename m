Hm, yes.

tl;dr: I was wrong about a local external reference being nicer.  But I
believe there is a difference between externally-facing header files
(e.g. block.h) and internal header files (e.g. block_int.h).  I don=E2=80=
=99t
know which of those block/export.h is supposed to be.

(And of course it doesn=E2=80=99t even matter at all, really.)


non-tl;dr:

We have a similar case for bdrv_{file,raw,qcow2}, but those are at least
in a *_int.h.  I can=E2=80=99t say I like that style.

OK, let me try to figure out what my problem with this is.

I think if a module (in this case the NBD export code) exports
something, it should be available in the respective header (i.e., some
NBD header), not in some other header.  A module=E2=80=99s header should pr=
esent
what it exports to the rest of the code.  The export code probably
doesn=E2=80=99t want to export the NBD driver object, it wants to import it=
,
actually.  So if it should be in a header file, it should be in an NBD
header.

Now none of our block drivers has a header file for exporting symbols to
the rest of the block code, which is why their symbols have been put
into block_int.h.  I think that=E2=80=99s cutting corners, but can be defen=
ded
by saying that block_int.h is not for exporting anything, but just
collects stuff internal to the block layer, so it kind of fits there.

(Still, technically, I believe bdrv_{file,raw,qcow2} should be exported
by each respective block driver in a driver-specific header file.  If
that isn=E2=80=99t the case, it doesn=E2=80=99t really matter to me whether=
 it=E2=80=99s put
into a dedicated header file to collect internal stuff (block_int.h) or
just imported locally (with an external declaration) where it=E2=80=99s use=
d.
Probably the dedicated header file is cleaner after all, right.)

Maybe block/export.h is the same in that it=E2=80=99s just supposed to coll=
ect
symbols used internally by the export code, then it isn=E2=80=99t wrong to =
put
it there.  But if it=E2=80=99s a header file that may be used by non-export=
 code
to use export functionality, then it would be wrong.

But whatever.

Now I have sorted out my feelings, and they don=E2=80=99t give any result a=
t
all, but it was kind of therapeutic for me.

Sounds all reasonable.  Thus, I=E2=80=99d leave it like you did it and care
about a registration model if/when we need it.
