I did an edit pass on this to address minor grammar/style
issues and some Sphinx syntax stuff (notably, using
"code-block:: c" renders nicer than a plain literal block).
Diff against this patch is below; it looks bigger than
you might expect because one of the changes was that I
rewrapped some of the paragraphs that were close to or
over 80 chars per line. Changes include the tweak Markus
asked for.
