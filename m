  Yes, I started with the MAINTAINERS file thinking at least some segregation 
would be a step forward than nothing.

| QMP is critical to many uses, so you wouldn't want to exclude it from a secure build;
| any security issue with it (e.g. misparsing an argument) would be very
| serious and would need to be looked at;

   No, High OR Low was not for excluding it from any build. It was merely an 
indication to a user to decide whether an issue should be treated as a CVE one 
or can be fixed as regular bug.

| but QMP is expected to be talking to another trusted endpoint.

  True; I set it to Low as QMP interface access is mostly given to privileged 
trusted users.


Thank you.
