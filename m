Does a machine-friendly CLI need to exist at all? Once you decide
that throwing away the current one is acceptable, you might as well
reduce the maintainance burden by requiring that software only
communicates with QEMU via QMP.

Does a human-friendly CLI need to be part of QEMU? We have built so
much amazing infrastructure on top of QEMU, and as of today none of
that work is benefiting people who run it directly.


As a proof of concept, I have spent a couple of hours writing the
attached shell script, which I hope will illustrate my point.

Usage is extremely simple: just do something like

  $ ./virt-run debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2

and after a few seconds the guest display will appear on your screen.

Behind the scenes, it uses a number of existing high-level tools:

  * virt-inspector, to figure out what guest OS is installed in the
    image;

  * virt-install, to produce a domain XML tailored to that specific
    guest OS and to create the corresponding libvirt domain;

  * virt-viewer, to provide the UI.

All these tools use libvirt under the hood, and additionally
virt-install uses libosinfo to obtain information about the guest
OS, such as whether or not it supports Virtio devices and how much
memory it needs to run smoothly.


The result is that, if you run

  $ qemu-system-x86_64 -hda debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2

you will get

  * a single CPU emulated with TCG;

  * 128 MiB of memory;

  * emulated I/O devices;

whereas the script will give you

  * 2 CPUs accelerated with KVM;

  * 1 GiB of memory;

  * Virtio devices for pretty much everything, including a
    virtio-rng device that will for example speed up the first boot
    significantly if SSH keys need to be (re)created.

Unsurprisingly, performance is different: when QEMU is invoked
directly, the login prompt for this specific image shows up after
~40 seconds, whereas when we use the script it only takes ~13 seconds
to get there. And the command line is just as simple, if not more so!

All of the above was obtained by hastily cobbling together existing
tools with <100 lines of shell scripting. Imagine how much better it
could be if we actually put some serious work in!


With my argument hopefully demonstrated: I think an architecture akin
to the one Dan has outlined earlier[1] would be a great direction to
take. QEMU can continue to focus on its core competency, that is,
virtual hardware, and leave most of the user interaction up to the
software interacting with its JSON-based API.


Obviously QEMU developers, for their own use, could still benefit
from having access to a user interface that doesn't require either
rigging up libvirt support or messing with JSON directly, and such
an interface could even look very similarly to the current CLI, but
it could simply not be made user-facing and thus not subject to any
compatibility concerns.
