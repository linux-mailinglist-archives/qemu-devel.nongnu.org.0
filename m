Ohh that's a new one for me. I see it is a KVM only project but it's
nice to see another VMM using the common rust-vmm backend. There is
interest in using rust-vmm to implement VMMs for type-1 hypervisors but
we need to work out if there are two many type-2 concepts backed into
the lower level rust crates.

Aside from the desire to limit the shared memory footprint between the
backend daemon and a guest not yet.

I suspect the eventfd mechanism might just end up being simulated by the
VMM as a result of whatever comes from the type-1 interface indicating a
doorbell has been rung. It is after all just a FD you consume numbers
over right?

Not all setups will have an equivalent of a Dom0 "master" guest to do
orchestration. Highly embedded are likely to have fixed domains created
as the firmware/hypervisor start up.
