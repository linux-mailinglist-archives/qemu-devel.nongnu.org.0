You could've really just edit the single cast in patch 1 before applying 
to change the it back but I've resent the changed patch 1 as v9 also 
adding your R-b for your convenience. Other patches are unchanged so you 
can take the v8 for those, I haven't resent those, let me know if you want 
the whole series but this is really getting much more work that it should 
be for such a simple change. (There is no cast in patch 2 as I've already 
stated several times.)
