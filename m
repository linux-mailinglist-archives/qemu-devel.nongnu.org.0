That's a shame, although I do appreciate the huge amount of time and effort that 
you've put into this release in order to get the Meson build up and running, and so 
why taking on another large task is going to be lower down the list :)

At the moment OpenBIOS doesn't have a docker image capable of building the required 
binaries: I did experiment with trying to use the QEMU docker images for openbios-ppc 
but whilst the binary built successfully, it did not run compared to my hand-rolled 
compilers. So there's still some debugging to be done there...


ATB,

Mark.
