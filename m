The block device feature (storage/bd xlator) got deprecated in Gluster
5.0, and was removed with Gluster 6.0. Fedora 29 is the last version
that contained the bd.so xlator (glusterfs-server 5.0, deprecated).

All currently maintained and available Gluster releases should have
glusterfs_xlator_opt (introduced with glusterfs-3.5 in 2014). However, I
am not sure what versions are provided with different distributions. The
expectation is that at least Gluster 5 is provided, as older releases
will not get any updates anymore. See
https://www.gluster.org/release-schedule/ for a more detailed timeline.

Unfortunately there is no reasonable way to probe for the type of
backend (block or filesystem) that is used. So, a runtime check to be on
the extreme safe side to fallback on block device backends is not an
option.

HTH,
Niels
