All this is about probing QEMU capabilities so that we can tell users
what to expect and let them change the default. E.g., qemu64 default CPU
model on x86_64 is never the right one to be used with KVM. By making
the default CPU model visible in the domain XML even before the domain
gets started, we help users detect such suboptimal configurations.

I guess the problem could be that QEMU capabilities probing in libvirt
is done with -machine none. We first probe with KVM enabled and then for
a few specific commands reprobe with TCG only. We could do it with
query-machines too to get different default CPU models depending on the
accelerator, but it wouldn't actually help.

The full command line used for capabilities probing is

    qemu-system-s390x \
        -S \
        -no-user-config \
        -nodefaults \
        -nographic \
        -machine none,accel=kvm:tcg \
        -qmp unix:/tmp/qmp-ivG4UN/qmp.monitor,server,nowait \
        -pidfile /tmp/qmp-ivG4UN/qmp.pid \
        -daemonize

One of the command we send is

    {"execute":"query-kvm","id":"libvirt-5"}

and the reply is

    {"return": {"enabled": true, "present": true}, "id": "libvirt-5"}

Which means KVM is usable and enabled, but still query-machines returns

    {
      "return": [
        {
          "hotpluggable-cpus": true,
          "name": "s390-ccw-virtio-4.0",
          "numa-mem-supported": false,
          "default-cpu-type": "qemu-s390x-cpu",
          "cpu-max": 248,
          "deprecated": false
        },
        {
          "hotpluggable-cpus": true,
          "name": "s390-ccw-virtio-3.1",
          "numa-mem-supported": false,
          "default-cpu-type": "qemu-s390x-cpu",
          "cpu-max": 248,
          "deprecated": false
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

So it seems the code is run during the machine initialization and thus
it doesn't affect what query-machines returns with -machine none.
