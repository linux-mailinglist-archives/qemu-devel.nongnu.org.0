Hm, yes, this is nasty.

Would it be any better have a wrapper script that just imports the
actual test so that the import path would still contain the main
qemu-iotests/ directory?

This is another option, especially if we do want to create a lib/.

I don't think this is necessary because the working directory wouldn't
change, so bash scripts should just keep working as before.

I think it would make it rather hard to find the files that belong to
the test harness implementation between all the tests. Currently, 'ls'
in the qemu-iotests directory is still kind of usable because all the
test cases are at the start and everything that comes later is not a
test.

I think leaving everything except named tests where it is, but setting
PYTHONPATH or having a wrapper script, is still a third option that's
worth considering. It sounds like the most attrative option to me.
