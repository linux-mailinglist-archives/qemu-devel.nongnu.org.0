There are three standard containers under /machine/:

* /machine/peripheral/

  Devices with a user-specified ID go here, as /machine/peripheral/ID.
  User-specified means -device or device_add.

  /machine/peripheral/ID is effectively a stable interface.  It's just
  underdocumented (undocumented?).

  To be useful, the stuff below ID/ needed to be stable and documented,
  too.

* /machine/peripheral-anon/

  Same, but user elected not to give an ID.
  /machine/peripheral-anon/device[N], where N counts up from zero in
  creation order.

  N is obviously not stable, but this is a problem of the user's making.
  If you want to refer to a device, give it an ID.

* /machine/unattached/

  The orphanage.  When a device has no parent when its realized, it gets
  put here, as /machine/unattached/device[N], where N counts up from
  zero in realization order.

  N is obviously not stable, and this time we can't blame the
  victim^Wuser.  You can search for devices of a certain type.
  Sometimes that's good enough.

  All the onboard devices are here, and much more.  We've fathered a lot
  of unloved red-headed children, it seems...

  Some of the "much more" is due to sloppy modelling, i.e. neglecting to
  set the proper parent.

  I figure we could put onboard devices in a nicer place, with nicer
  names.  Need a convention for the place and the names, then make board
  code conform to it.
