Yes, possibly iothreads could be restricted to QMP. It doesn't help me
in splitting the monitor in any way, though, so I don't see it within
the scope of this series.

Keeping readline around for QMP, on the other hand, would probably have
been harder than making the restriction.

As for splitting patch 2, I don't think that reorganising a patch that
already does its job and already received review is the most productive
thing we could do, but if you insist on a separate patch, I can do that.

Yes:

monitor_data_init() does a memset(), but only on hmp.common, so the
fields outside of hmp.common would remain uniniitialised. Specifically,
hmp.rs wouldn't be initialised to NULL and attempting to free it in the
end would crash.

I would like to see all HMP command handlers take MonitorHMP* instead of
Monitor*, but that would be a big ugly patch touching everything that
isn't really needed for the goal of this series, so I didn't include it.

If you consider it valuable to get rid of this container_of(), that's
probably the follow-up you could do.

Probably a copy & paste error, thanks for catching it! I'll fix it.

As above, initialising the fields outside mon->common.
