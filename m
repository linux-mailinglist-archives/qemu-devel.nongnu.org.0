Agreed.  There are a number of work items already to cover this.  One
is a more generic test metadata collection system:

   https://trello.com/c/lumR8u8Y/1526-rfc-nrunner-extended-metadata

We already have code that can find the required assets, and with that,
we can let the job (not the test) attempt to fulfill those
requirements, skipping the tests if they can not be fulfilled.

Until this is available, we can wrap the "fetch_asset()" calls and
cancel the test if it fails.

I guess this would require an Avocado installation-wide configuration
entry for the available cache directories.  IMO given that
configuration is applied, the tests should transparently find assets
in the configured locations.

My understanding is that we would publish those files as a Python
module with versions matching QEMU.  No stability would be promised.
Users can always require a specific version of the Python module that
matches the QEMU version they expect/want to use.

A simpler (complementary?) solution, or maybe just a good practice, is
to try to use in the examples:

  "./tests/venv/bin/avocado run ..."

Do you think this would be enough?  It would of course not cover the
examples in previous commit messages.

Thanks!
