Maybe (2) is still viable, as long as there are no expectations
that features will be removed in future hardware.  Compatibility
with future hardware in (2) is more about convenience, not a hard
a requirement.

In either case, (1) is the building block for making (2) work.
This means we can start by implementing (1), and see if we can
include features in new CPU models later.

Sounds good to me.  I would also make intel-pt passthrough work
if using "-cpu host" and/or an explicit "intel-pt-passthrough=on"
option.
