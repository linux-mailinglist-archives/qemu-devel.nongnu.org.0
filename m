Yes I agree on that if we're refactoring the comment then we can make
it more explicit here.  For my own preference, I would prefer the
latter one, even we can have a bigger comment above MonitorHMP
mentioning that it's only used in main thread so no lock is needed for
all the HMP only structs (until someone wants to hammer on HMP again).
