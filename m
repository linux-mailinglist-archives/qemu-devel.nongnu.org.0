Not good. It artificially limits who can reuse this code.

Matches what qemu itself uses, so fine; but makes it harder to reuse the 
code in a standalone library.

> * LGPL 2.1

Same problems as GPL2-only

Looser than qemu as a whole, has all the benefits of GPL2+ plus the 
additional benefit of being able to copy the code into other LGPL 
standalone libraries.

It's also acceptable to use even looser licenses, like BSD 2-clause, but 
preferably only if that other license is already used by part of qemu 
(we don't need to make our mix even worse than it already is).

You may also want advice from lawyers, based on how you see your code 
being reused outside of qemu.  This list can offer advice, but it is 
non-binding and may not best fit your needs.
