Sorry for the late answer.

I only have : 

  TXBUF SIZE: Transmit buffer size in byte
  The transmit buffer size can not be zero.

yes.

yes.

yes.

XPKT_LOST means that packets are lost due to late/excessive 
collision. I have used this status for large frames because
not other bits made sense.

I agree.

AHB_ERR is not used in the Aspeed implementation. I checked with 
them. But I think it makes sense for other implementations, so we
can add this status for Linux.

NO_NPTXBUF means a lack a transmit descriptors.


XPKT_LOST is our best choice then.
