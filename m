Hi,

As reported in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1740193, our
curl block driver can spontaneously hang.  This becomes visible e.g.
when reading compressed qcow2 images:

$ qemu-img convert -p -O raw -n \
  https://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.4.0/cirros-0.4.0-x86_64-disk.img \
  null-co://

(Hangs at 74.21 %, usually.)

A more direct way is:

$ qemu-img bench -f raw http://download.qemu.org/qemu-4.1.0.tar.xz \
    -d 1 -S 524288 -c 2

(Which simply performs two requests, and the second one hangs.  You can
use any HTTP resource (probably FTP, too) you=E2=80=99d like that is at l=
east
1 MB in size.)

It turns out that this is because cURL 7.59.0 has added a protective
feature against some misuse we had in our code: curl_multi_add_handle()
must not be called from within a cURL callback, but in some cases we
did.  As of 7.59.0, this fails, our new request is not registered and
the I/O request stalls.  This is fixed by patch 6.

Patch 7 makes us check for curl_multi_add_handle()=E2=80=99s return code,
because if we had done that before, debugging would have been much
simpler.


On the way to fixing it, I had a look over the whole cURL code and found
a suspicious QLIST_FOREACH_SAFE() loop that actually does not seem very
safe at all.  I think this may lead to crashes, although I have never
seen any myself.  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1744602#c=
5
shows one in exactly the function in question, so I think it actually is
a problem.

This is fixed by patch 5, patches 1, 2, and 4 prepare for it.

(Patch 3 is kind of a misc patch that should ensure that we always end
up calling curl_multi_check_completion() whenever a request might have
been completed.)


v2:
- Patch 2: Remove the socket from the list only add the end of the
           function (yielding a nicer 5+/5- diff stat)
- Patch 3: Added
- Patch 4: Rebased on patch 3, and s/socket/ready_socket/ in one place
- Patch 5: Rebased on the changed patch 4
