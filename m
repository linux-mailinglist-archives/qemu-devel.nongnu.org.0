It was ok for me:
qemu-system-aarch64 -cpu cortex-a53 -display none -serial stdio \
  -machine virt -kernel zephyr-64.elf -net none \
  -icount 
shift=6,align=off,sleep=off,rr=replay,rrfile=record.out,rrsnapshot=rrstart 
  \
  -drive file=record.qcow2,if=none,id=rr -s -S

I don't know anything about sleep, but qemu_icount_bias is saved in 
vmstate when icount is enabled.

However, I noticed a strange condition at cpus.c:855
Shouldn't we check !sleep here instead of !icount_sleep?

     } else if (!icount_sleep) {
         error_setg(errp, "shift=auto and sleep=off are incompatible");
         return;
     }

     icount_sleep = sleep;
