OK, so you mean just noting everywhere explicitly how many children can
get a specific flag, and not just in some cases?  That is, make a note
for DATA and METADATA that they can be given to an arbitrary number of
children, and COW only to at most one.

Another argument is that right now, bs->file points to x-raw, and
.is_filter is set.  So x-raw is already treated as the filtered child.

Good point.  It would work if filters are just skipped for functions
that read/query stuff, which I think is the case.  I don=E2=80=99t think we=
 ever
skip filters when it comes to modifying data.

In any case, I wouldn=E2=80=99t lose too much sleep over blkverify whatever=
 we
do.  It=E2=80=99s a driver used purely for debugging purposes.

I wonder why blkverify decides that.  This should be up to the user, and
if the user wants to keep the verification image around, blkverify
shouldn=E2=80=99t prevent that.

That too.

blkverify is just a bit weird, and I personally don=E2=80=99t mind just tre=
ating
it as something =E2=80=9Cspecial=E2=80=9D, considering it=E2=80=99s just a =
debugging aid.

Regardless of blkverify, I don=E2=80=99t think FILTERED children must be th=
e
only children, though, because I can well imagine filter drivers having
metadata children on the side, e.g. config data or bitmaps (not just
dirty bitmaps, but also e.g. what to cache for a hypothetical cache driver)=
.
