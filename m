Well it's not that hard to abort a migration (I'm not sure we've got a
convenient wrapper to do it - but it shouldn't be hard to add).

Oh, so it is.

No!
Avocado has a migration+reset test, so it's worth trying.
Certainly in a cloud setup migrations happen often and no one knows
what the guest is doing;  aborting the source isn't acceptable.

It surprises me a bit that the region sizes would change due to guest
actions - I thought they were determined by the set of virtual hardware;
not sure if a hot-unplug/plug followed by reset would trigger it or not.
