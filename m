Candidates are any commands that perform I/O. You don't want to hold the
BQL while doing I/O. Probably most block layer commands fall into this
category.

In fact, even the commands to start a block job could probably make use
of this infrastructure because they typically do some I/O before
returning success for starting the job.

My understanding is that this is just an internal change and commands
still aren't processed in parallel.
