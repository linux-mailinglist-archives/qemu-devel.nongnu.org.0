OK. How about adding below before returning -1 (for the overflow case):

...
xbzrle_counters.bytes += TARGET_PAGE_SIZE;
return -1;

Example: if we have 2 pages encoded as below:
4KB--> after normal encoding: 2KB
4KB--> after overflow: 4KB (will be sent as non-encoded page)
then the encoding rate is 8KB / 6KB = ~1.3
(if we skip the counting of the overflow case,
the encoding rate will be 4KB/ 2KB=2. Users may think that's
good to go with xbzrle, unless they do another calculation with
checking the overflow numbers themselves)

Best,
Wei
