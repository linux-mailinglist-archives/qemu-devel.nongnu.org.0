Will it?  cpus.o is compiled only on CONFIG_SOFTMMU.

I agree with Igor's goal, but let's do it one step at a time.
Replacing the smp_* globals with qdev_get_machine() is a step in
the right direction, IMO.

I don't see why it should precede -smp refactoring.

We have a very specific user-visible goal here: making one extra
CPU topology option (CPU dies) available on PC only.  Asking the
author to refactor some code while implementing that is
reasonable.  Requiring the author to touch every single place
where a CPU object is created in QEMU just to avoid a
qdev_get_machine() call doesn't seem reasonable.

I believe we need a better CPU creation API that all machines can
use, otherwise all of them will have to duplicate the same code
between object_new() and object_propert_set_bool("realized", true).

But I really don't think designing and implementing this new API
should be a requirement to get useful work done.
