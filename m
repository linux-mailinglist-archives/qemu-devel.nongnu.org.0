Is 'appliance' a qcow2 file?  If so, another way to accomplish this 
could include:

nbdkit streaming --run 'qemu-img convert --image-opts 
driver=raw,size=256,file.driver=qcow2,file.file.driver=file,file.file.filename=appliance 
"$uri"' | file -

which says to use qemu-img to open a length-limited view of the file, 
and stream the entire thing to an NBD server, where nbdkit then provides 
a way to convert that to a pipeline to feed into file (since qemu's NBD 
server doesn't directly like writing into a pipe).

I'm also wondering if the 'nbdcopy' program (not yet released in a 
stable version, but available in libnbd.git) could be put to use on this 
front, with some way to quickly combine it with qemu-nbd serving 
appliance.qcow2.

'qemu-img dd' _should_ be merely syntactic sugar for 'qemu-img convert', 
but it isn't yet.  Until we rectify that feature parity (there are 
things that dd can't do like better output control and skipping, and 
there are things that convert can't do like length limiting and offset 
selection), hacking up 'qemu-io' (which is for debugging use only) is a 
tolerable short-term solution; but qemu-io was NEVER intended for stable 
use cases.  If adding this makes debugging qemu easier, then go for it; 
but if the real problem is that qemu-img is missing functionality, we 
should instead be focusing on fixing qemu-img.
