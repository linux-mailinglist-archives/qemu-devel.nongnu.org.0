It is fine for multiple writable disks too, if they're all qcow2 backed.

External snapshots can be made to work today if you're willing to pause
the VM CPUs while you take the external snapshots, and run the migration
to capture VM state. The main reason apps like Boxes / Virt-manager don't
use external snapshots is that they require more complicated decision
making. For each type of storage you're dealing with you have a potentially
different way to manage the external snapshot. Boxes took the view that it
would only support qcow2 to avoid making those decisions. virt-manager has
support for all types of storage and simply doesn't want to add the complex
logic to deal with non-qcow2.

Saying it is the first configured disk was not that crazy. This has been
a pretty well defined semantic historically, as disks are usually added
to QEMU in a predictable order, because that in turn controls how QEMU
assigns addresses, and thus the order in which guest OS detect them.

The introduction of use of the block layer for UEFI storage really
threw a spanner in the works from QEMU's side. Even then the semantics
aren't bad from a app's POV - first disk is still well defined as a
concept, as UEFI vars isn't really considered a disk from an app POV.

That part of the commit message is referring to the original reason for
not porting loadvm/savevm when QMP was first created 10+ years ago, which
was primarily due to its blocking nature. The issues around disk selection
post-date that. I'll modify it to describe both issues

As implemented in this series, the commands always succeed with the
errors only ever reported via query-jobs. So for error detection
you are already forced to use  the job framework.

If you want to see some examples, take a look at the very last patch
in the series which introduces I/O test 310. The test covers various
success and failure scenarios, so you can see the behaviour we are
currently generating with this series.

query-named-block-nodes isn't friendly as a way to lookup node names,
as it doesn't include the "id" value for the original -drive, so
correlating block nodes to drives is not straightforward.  query-block
does seem a bit better in respect.

So if an app is currently using loadvm/savevm with human_monitor_command,
and is using -drive, they have to go through a mapping process to figure
out node names. Not especially friendly if they were happy with the
current choice of disks QEMU makes by default.

Both parameters have the same issue wrt needing to have the blockdev
node names. So once you have to specify one parameter, you might as
well specify both. IOW, either we make both optional with defaults, or
both mandatory with no default. I don't think it makes sense to mix.

Yep, this is likely another thing that should be documented for the QMP
commands. The VM frontend config must be identical across load/save
otherwise VM state will fail to restore. DIsk backends should be the
same too unless you're specifying an explicit list of node names.

I think it would be reasonable to make the existance of multiple
vmstates on different disks be a hard error both for QMP and for
the existing HMP commands, if not specifying an explicit device,
as its almostly certainly a admin/mgmt app screw up.
