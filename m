Can you explain what you mean by 'stage 2'?

This is the first report I've seen for it.  How did you conclude that
4c011c3 caused it?  While I can see it might have some effect on the
bandwidth management, I'm surprised it has this much effect.

What size huge pages are you using - 2MB or 1GB?
I can imagine we might have a problem that since we only do the sleep
between the hugepages, if we were using 1GB hugepages then
we'd see <big chunk of data>[sleep]<big chunk of data>[sleep]
which isn't as smooth as it used to be.

Can you give me some more details of your test?

Dave
