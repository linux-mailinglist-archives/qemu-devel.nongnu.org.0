Currently the tooling creates a union of recipients based on the set of
files changed by the patchset and then sends the whole series to
everybody.

That is to ensure that the recipient has the full context.

No, we don't care about that. We care about changes to the
'docs/system/deprecated.rst'. In this very specific instance we usually
don't even care about the context of the other patches and can look them
up manually if necessary.

The problem is that the tooling currently doesn't really allow this
usage. The next best thing is to send more emails rather than forget to
send the notification.

Feel free to fix the git-publish tool. IMO asking
maintainers/contributors to just CC patches which change
'docs/system/deprecated.rst' to libvirt-list would create too
complicated rules and is in general not worth doing. Just if we can do
it programatically.

If this ever becomes a problem for libvir-list I'm sure that we'll drop
ourselves from the CC if we reach such consensus.

Please don't question this approach any more if you don't plan to fix
the tooling.
