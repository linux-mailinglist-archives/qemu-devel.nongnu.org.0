yes that's correct

Sorry I don't get your point. My understanding is in
vfio_listener_region_add() we detect the addition of an IOMMU MR and
init a notifier that covers the input AS it translates (GVA). When the
guest sends an IOTLB invalidation on its first stage, this is trapped,
we notify the UNMAP notifier and this eventually produces a stage1
invalidation at physical level (through VFIO/IOMMU kernel path). This
piece is not yet implemented: see below.

Yes the UNMAP notifier implementation is definitively different. It
calls a VFIO iotcl that eventually produces a physical IOMMU stage1
invalidation. See ttps://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10962721/.

Maybe the confusion comes from the fact this patch is *not* an
integration for nested SMMUv3 with VFIO. SMMUv3/VFIO still does not
work. It just allows the guest to boot by bypassing the replay function.
If things are clearer maybe I should simply assert() in case we detect a
VFIO device protected by an SMMUv3.

Sorry it is in this commit message. Reference to
