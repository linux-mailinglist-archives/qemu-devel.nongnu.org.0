yes，the cpu model is indeed used with kvm.

There is a situation where the host cpu model is Cortex-A72 and
a 'custom' cpu mode is used to keep insrtuction set compatible between
the source and destination host machine when doing live migration.
So the host physical machine cpu model is Cortex-A72 but
host-passthrough model is mode used here.

In the above scenario, the cpu mode is Cortex-A72 but maybe only a 
subset of cpu feature is presented to the guest.

Since the cpu model is not 'host' here, the kvm-adjvtime is not enabled 
by default. The guest virtual time will not be adjusted.
