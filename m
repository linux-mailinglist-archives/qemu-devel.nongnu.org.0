Thank you for checking this issue.

I looked at the ptimer code, like you said. Just one question: isn't this u=
sed by other hw as well?
Maybe this problem is more general...

I also tried (basically) the same example on a aarch64 (raspberry pi3),
and I don't find any problems there. Maybe could be helpful to look how
this problem is solved there.

Just trying to help

Title:
  arm9 clock pending (SP804)

Status in QEMU:
  Confirmed

Bug description:
  Hello all,

  I'm using the versatilepb board and the timer Interrupt Mask Status
  register (offset 0x14 of the SP804) does not seem to be working
  properly on the latest qemu-2.12. I tried on the 2.5 (i believe this
  is the mainstream version that comes with Linux) and it works
  perfectly.

  What happens is that the pending bit does not seem to be set in some
  scenarios. In my case, I see the timer value decreasing to 0 and then
  being reset to the reload value and neither does the interrupt is
  triggered nor the pending bit is set.

  I believe this is a matter of timing since in the "long" run the
  system eventually catches up (after a few microseconds).

  Thank you
