All the evidence we have is that developers generally do not do a good
job at maintaining infrastructure in their spare time. This is largely
unavoidable since a developer is always going to treat sysadmin tasks as
a part time thing to spend as little time as possible on, prioritizing
their coding work. So we end up either with unreliable services that
continuously break (look how many times has Patchew died from ENOSPC
this year), or the service happens to work reliably but is unmaintained
becoming increasingly out of date and thus vulnerable, or the service
simply ends up lagging behind state of the art offered by alternatives.

Clearly the ideal situation would be 100% free software infrastructure
we can use at zero cost, while still being state of the art in terms
of services available to support our workflow. This doesn't exist, so
we have to figure out the most effective tradeoff to make that supports
QEMU's needs in an effective manner.

GitLab's open core model means we're at least partially using open
source infra, even if some features are closed. The basic GitLab CI
features are actually open source AFAIK, so we're not relying on the
closed source infra part of GitLab in that area. IOW, joining the
open source program there is simply about getting an increased grant
of free hardware resources to use.

This is certainly preferrable to us making more use of Travis or
Cirrus CI, or GitHub Actions, all of which are 100% closed CI
systems AFAIK.

Some projects have deployed their own GitLab instances (GNOME,
FreeDesktop), but that is not without significant challenges in
terms of deploying and maintaining the software as well as
providing sufficient hardware to go along. eg See the surprising
effect this self-hosting had on FreeDesktop costs:

  https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2020-February/041232.html

It has been a long tedious road merely to bring up a small number
of CI runners on hardware sponsored by Red Hat, let alone get
enough hardware to replace everything that we and our contributors
currentl get for free via various public services. 

There's ultimately a big gap that exists in terms of a publically
host Git Forge that offers state of the art features, based on
100% open source infra. I'm not seeing anyone being able to solve
that in the forseeable future, and it doesn't seem like a sane use
of QEMU's limited contributor time to divert resources away from
development into infrastructure. We need to make a pragmatic
tradeoff, certainly favouring open source where possible, but if
we need to use other services too that's acceptable.

Our switch to increasingly use GitLab for CI is certainly an
improvement over our historical use of Travis, Shippable and
Cirrus, and better for our contributors than our reliance on
a handful of machines that only the QEMU Git maintainer can
access, or the patchew system that breaks multiple times a
year.
