Yes, exactly. And I know even less about what happens if a child is
neither bs->file nor bs->backing. Imagine a qcow2 image with an external
data file that is a qcow2 image with a backing file itself. :-)

Actually, just having two qcow2 layers nested with bs->file probably
already fails.

I'm not sure yet if this means that these interfaces are wrong, but it
might. But in any case, I think we depend on special-casing in more
places than we should.

Yes, because that's where it's reading the data from.

Hm... Now I wonder what this means for DATA... In theory it would have
to be set for backing files, but that would make it completely useless.
We can distinguish the cases by looking at *file, but how does the
generic block layer know which child should be counted as "allocated"
and which shouldn't?

Maybe. I think I need to draw a bit on the whiteboard before I can
really say anything. It would probably be a pretty fundamental change to
the model how block_status works.
