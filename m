I've not looked at the patch series above in detail, but I'm thinking
that even if the file is 64 MB in size, it should never read all 64 MB
of data. The block layer APIs have ability to detect and report holes,
so it ought to be possible to only read the data which is non-zero,
and thus avoid dirtying more than 3 MB of useful

With regards,
Daniel
