Hi, I will add it to my queue. I intended to take over Python 
maintenance but I have been busy refactoring the QAPI python code and 
haven't been reading my mail as regularly.

I'm volunteering, since I am doing so much work in Python. I could use a 
dedicated reviewer to help me, however. I prefer a maintainer policy 
where all patches get at least ONE review by someone other than the 
primary author.

In the case that I am writing so much Python, I still need a 
co-maintainer to help review *my* patches.
