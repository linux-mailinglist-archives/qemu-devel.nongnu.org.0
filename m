Lets say the lpa2 feature was tied so it only gets enabled in the
new 7.0 machine type version, even if KVM/QEMU could supports it
fine with any machine type version. If someone runs a VM with
Linux 5.6 with

  -cpu max -machine virt'

it is going to break.

Our choice is then between telling them to change their QEMU config to

   -cpu max,-lpa2 -machine virt

vs telling them to use

   -cpu max -machine virt-6.2

there's not much practical difference in those scenarios, for someone
deploying a new VM instance.

It would, however, benefit people who had already previously deployed
a VM with QEMU using a explicit versioned machine type. This would
be the case for anyone using libvirt, as libvirt always expands the
user's config to be fully versioned.

With regards,
Daniel
