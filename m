Public bug reported:

This is quite odd, and I'm not sure about how to get around it. I'm writing=
 an OS in Rust and require APIC support. When I boot my kernel with qemu-sy=
stem-x86_64, however, it dumps out a [lot] of warnings; it claims that TCG =
doesn't support FMA, X2APIC, AVX, F16C, AVX2, RDSEED, SHA-NI, FXSR-OPT, mis=
alignsse, 3dnowprefetch, osvw, topoext, perfctr-core, clzero, xsaveerptr, i=
bpb, nrip-save, xsavec, and xsaves, but prints these warnings over 80 times=
 before finally doing what I told it to do. Running QEMU 5.0.0 (unknown com=
mit hash), as follows:
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=3Draw,file=3Dtarget\x86_64-kernel-none\deb=
ug\bootimage-kernel.bin -serial stdio -no-reboot -hdb disk.img -s -m 4G -us=
b -rtc base=3Dutc,clock=3Dhost -cpu EPYC-v3,+acpi,+apic,+rdrand,+rdseed,+ss=
e,+sse2,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+sse4a,+ssse3,+syscall,+x2apic -smp cpus=3D8 -sound=
hw all
I would run using HAXM, but my kernel requires RDRAND, and QEMU does not, t=
o my knowledge, automatically support RDRAND (and I don't know how to enabl=
e it).
