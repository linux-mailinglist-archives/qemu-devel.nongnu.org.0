Sounds good.

This is what I tried, when I was putting together the patch-series, and
it raised an error when I was testing it in the oss-fuzz
docker-containers. I blamed it on Docker, originally, but I just took a
closer look, and the problem was that "qemu-fuzz-i386" isn't on the same
file-system as $DEST_DIR in the oss-fuzz Docker. If I copy
qemu-fuzz-i386 to $DEST_DIR/lib, and do 
    ln "$DEST_DIR/lib/qemu-fuzz-i386" \
       "$DEST_DIR/qemu-fuzz-i386-target-$target"
everything works :)
Thanks
