Fair enough. And anyway, if we really need to address that, it can be done
later.

"proxy" is a backend where all I/O accesses are performed by a separate
process running the virtfs-proxy-helper command. It runs with root
privileges, which provides the same level of functionality as "local"
with security_model=passthrough. It also chroot() into the shared
folder for extra security. But it is slower since it all requests
still go through the virtio-9p device in QEMU. This would call
for a vhost-9p implementation, but it's yet another story.

"synth" is a software pseudo-backend, currently used to test 9pfs
with QTest (see tests/virtio-9p-test.c).
