Title:
  Regression: SIGSEGV running Java

Status in QEMU:
  Expired

Bug description:
  I have a build script that bootstraps a Debian armhf image. Part of
  the process involves running a Java program while inside a chroot. I
  am using Debian's qemu-user-static package to run the armhf Java
  binary on an amd64 system.

  qemu-user-static version 1:2.7+dfsg-3~bpo8+2 works fine. Version
  1:2.8+dfsg-1~bpo8+1 always causes Java to crash with a SIGSEGV. The
  location of the crash appears to be random and hasn't been the same
  twice.

  I am using the Azul Systems Zulu Embedded Java runtime, rather than
  the regular OpenJDK runtime, because the Zulu runtime has an arm32 JIT
  whereas OpenJDK is interpreter-only on arm32.

  I can reproduce the problem easily by mounting the image created by my
  build script and executing "java -XshowSettings -version" in a chroot.
  I can give you the image if that would help debug the problem.
