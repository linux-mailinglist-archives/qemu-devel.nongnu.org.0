Also doesn't describe why we need to explicitly set the array length
upfront, rather than inferring it from the set of elements that are
specified, auto-extending the array bounds as we set each property.

If we consider that our canonical representation is aiming to be QAPI,
and QAPI has unbounded arrays, then by implication if we want a mapping
to a flat CLI syntax, then we need some mechanism for unbounded arrays.

It would be valid to argue that we shouldn'be be trying to map the full
expressiveness of QAPI into a flat CLI syntax though, and should just
strive for full JSON everywhere.

Indeed every time we have these discussions, I wish we were already at
the "full JSON everywhere" point, so we can stop consuming our time
debating how to flatten JSON structure into CLI options. But since
these array props already exist, we need to find a way out of the
problem...

With regards,
Daniel
