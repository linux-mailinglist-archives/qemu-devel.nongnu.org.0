That's okay, but the commit message could be clearer.  Perhaps:

    tests/qapi/doc-good.json: Prepare for qapi-doc Sphinx extension

    doc-good.json tests doc comment parser corner cases.  We're about to
    largely replace it by a Sphinx extension, which will have different
    corner cases.  Tweak the test so it passes both with the old parser
    and the Sphinx extension, by making it match the more restrictive
    rST syntax:

     * in a single list the bullet types must all match
     * lists must have leading and following blank lines
     * indentation is important
     * the '|' example syntax is going to go away entirely, so stop
       testing it

    This will avoid the tests spuriously breaking when we tighten up the
    parser code in the following commits.

Ah, now I remember.

Remind me, how is messed up doc comment indentation reported in the
brave new Sphinx world?

The test's purpose is to be mean to the doc parser, not pleasant to the
reader's eye ;)

The doc before the patch tests the (less than ideal) handling of a
mistake that is easy to make, namely forgetting the ':' after the member
name.

Your change is okay.

Thanks!

Preferably with an improved commit message
