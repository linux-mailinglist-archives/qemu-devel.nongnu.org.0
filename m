Even though I disagree and it would waste ~256Mb 4Gb of RAM,
I think I should be able to replace #43 with
  "hppa: allow max ram size upto 4Gb"
as it still removes fix up at mapped address space level,
removes fix up of global ram_size variable and adds max size check,

which lets hppa board get out of the way of re-factoring
generic RAM allocation and making what board does with
provided RAM its own business.

whichever way I read it
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg667855.html
states user convenience as a reason.

As for correctness wrt real hardware questions are:
 * is one able to stuff hardware with unsupported 4Gb or more DIMMs,
   will system even work?
 * what real hardware does with top 256Gb of 4Gb RAM if present?
   Is it addressable/accessible in some way by CPUs or devices?
 * how does real firmware discovers amount of installed RAM
