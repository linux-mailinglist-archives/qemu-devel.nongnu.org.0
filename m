Hi; thanks for the bug report. This is a duplicate of LP:1805913. It requir=
es a host kernel change to fix this bug (which is being discussed but hasn'=
t been written yet). Otherwise the only known workarounds are:
 * downgrade the guest (arm) glibc to 2.27 or earlier
 * use a filesystem on the host which is not ext3/ext4 (often not practical)

Title:
  svn checkout fails with E000075 "Value too large for defined data
  type"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  I try to autobuild for ARM7 with qemu-arm-static. Part of this is
  downloading source via SVN.

  Whenever I try to download a SVN repository I get the following
  output:

  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0svn: E000075: Can't read directory '...': Value t=
oo large for
  defined data type

  This is the repository I'm trying to check out:
  https://svn.baycom.de/repos/vdr-mcli-plugin/

  qemu-arm-static version is 4.2.0

  I've also tried older versions without change.

  Platform I try to emulate is armv7h (Arch Linux ARM for Raspberry Pi
  2)

  Host system is AMD64

  This can be reproduced 100% of the time. Here I have the issue
  happening on Travis CI:

  https://travis-ci.com/github/VDR4Arch/vdr4arch/jobs/304839747#L9944
