On the topic of scrubbing, it would actually be nice to have a
"secure delete" for QEMU block driver formats that can do some
level of scrubbing in software and/or calling out to hardware support.

Similarly to prealloc a choice of 'metadata' or 'full'. Wwith LUKS
you can do well by just scrubbing the image header (which kills the
master decryption key rendering payload useless).
