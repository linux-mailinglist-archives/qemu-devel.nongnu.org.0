x86 has only one static CPU model, called "base", just to make
type=3Dstatic expansion work.  Having multiple "<model>-base" CPU
models would help make the extra feature list shorter, yes.

But we would still need to decide how to handle the
accel-specific code in x86_cpu_load_model(), including:
* kvm_default_props/tcg_default_props;
* x2apic special case for !kvm_irqchip_in_kernel();
* host vendor ID special case for KVM.

If we include that in static expansion, it would be a large
number of user-visible side effects for something that was
supposed to just add/remove a tiny set of CPU features to an
existing configuration.  If we don't, we are breaking the rules
of static expansion (aren't we?).

We can still try to address this and make
"query-cpu-model-expansion type=3Dstatic ...,recommended-features=3Don"
work on x86, and see it is usable by libvirt in x86.  I'm just
worried that the interface may become complex, easy to get wrong,
and hard to validate until full libvirt support is implemented.
query-cpu-model-expansion is very extensible and flexible, but
hard to explain and reason about.

Understood.  When exactly would all-features=3Don be useful for
management software?
