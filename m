I think the problem is knowing whether this is sufficient or whether you
definitely need to do it for other cases of removal/readd.

However, assuming we need to do it during reset, how do we know this is
the right point to do it, and not something further inside the reset
process?  Is this just on the basis that vcpus are stopped?
