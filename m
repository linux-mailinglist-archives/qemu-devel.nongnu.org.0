So the problem of adding DTB overlays is it's not that much easier than
the current options of using -machine dumpdtb and then hand hacking the
magic values and rebuilding, for example:

  https://medium.com/@denisobrezkov/xen-on-arm-and-qemu-1654f24dea75

Unless we come up with some sort of template support that allows QEMU to
insert numbers like address and size while processing the template. But
that seems a little too over engineered and likely introduces complexity
into the system.

Given the generic-loader is so simple I'm leaning towards another
approach of just c&p'ing generic-loader into a new "magic" device (maybe
guest-loader) and stripping out the bits we don't need (data, data-len,
be etc) and making the options more tuned what we are trying to achieve.
For example:

  -device guest-loader,kernel=3Dpath/to/Image,args=3D"command line",addr=3D=
0x47000000,hyp=3Dxen
  -device guest-loader,initrd=3Dpath/to/initrd,addr=3D0x42000000,hyp=3Dxen

And then we can embed the smarts in the loader to set either DTB or ACPI
entries as required and if we need additional magic to support different
hypervisors (which hopefully you don't but...) you can modulate the
hyp=3DFOO variable.

There may be an argument for having a -hypervisor as a sugar alias for
-kernel (which maps to machine.kernel) but currently I see no practical
differences you need to launch it except maybe forcing the
virtualisation property to true if it exists - but that seems a little
ARM focused.
