I agree. Currently we don't get anywhere close to allowing mixed XLEN systems.

Allowing 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs on a system is a useful goal, as for
example that is what the HiFive 1 has. As richard said though the main
interest at this point is the boot CPU, which the board can specify
different harts depending on what it is doing.

This is just the first step to making RISC-V more flexible with XLEN,
there will be more patches in the future to continue improving this.

I'm going to apply this series today.
