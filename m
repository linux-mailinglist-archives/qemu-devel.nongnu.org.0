I understand, that we can somehow assign ids from the QMP interface but
above will not push vcpus into "peripheral" container. They will appear
in "unattached" container but with specified names and as-far-as I can
see in the code 'device_del' can only delete objects/devices from the
'peripheral' container?

Plus, having those many ids specified for over large number of vcpus
does not looks very practical solution. We need interface like auto
Generation of ids even at the boot time. I could see from the link you
have shared that it is already being used by ID_BLOCK subsystem. Can we
create a new subsystem for cpus under this and do the auto Generation
of vcpu ids as well?


> Question is:

Idea is to be able to use 'device_del' interface to unplug vcpus
both for the cold-plugged and hot-plugged cases using the standard
'device_add' interface.

Plus, there is another unique requirement specifically for realizing
vcpu hotplug for ARM64.

Summary:
Right now ARM architecture does not allows reinitializing the GIC
after VM has booted. Therefore, we are planning to pre-size the GIC
interfaces at init time by initializing all of the possible vcpus
and keep them in 'realized' but 'unavailable' state to the Guest
VM. They shall be made available as-and-when vcpus are hot-plugged
later-on. Therefore, current efforts are to be able to plug and
unplug from the qemu QOM without destroying the existing state of
the devices/objects representing vcpus. These all possible vcpus
shall be created once at the boot time of the VM. The vcpus which
are not available to the Guest VM can be Parked.=20

Once the vcpus are hot-(un)plug'ged only the (pre-)plug/unplug(-request)
interfaces are used to convey this even information to the Guest
VM.

I have tested this solution and it works but I wanted to make sure
that I am not doing anything which breaks any of the existing Qemu
QOM interfaces and basic fundamental idea behind being able to attach
and detach from the Qemu QOM is okay?

Any suggestion are welcome in this regard?


NOTE: I plan to share the patches with the community which includes
both the changes of the Linux Kernel and the QEMU in near future.

Ok, sure. I did see the qdev_set_id() interface. Infact, earlier I was actu=
ally
trying to play with it by making it more generic and adding even the 'unatt=
ached'
container handling to it(which is missing right now) and calling it inside =
the
device_set_realized()  instead of below code:

        if (!obj->parent) {
            gchar *name =3D g_strdup_printf("device[%d]", unattached_count+=
+);

            object_property_add_child(container_get(qdev_get_machine(),
                                                    "/unattached"),
                                      name, obj, &error_abort);
            unattached_parent =3D true;
            g_free(name);
        }

Idea of above dabbling was to have common interface for 'unattached' contai=
ner
and call it from virt.c from machvirt_init() where possible vcpus are being
created. Force them to be located either inside 'unttached' or 'peripheral'
container akin to the example you had given.

If we look at qdev_device_add() function, after setting dev->id using
qdev_set_id() (which would also result in parenting of an object under
'peripheral' container), it calls the function to 'realize' the device/obje=
ct
which would end up in hitting above shared code excerpt and now because
it will have the parent already set, the object won't go into 'unattached'
container.

Currently, later cannot be controlled for the cold-lugged vcpus. Therefore,
before this discussion my initial thought process was to either make
qdev_set_id() universal (i.e. include handling for all type of containers
unattached/peripheral/anonymous in qdev_set_id()). Then call it from
machvirt_init() just before the vcpus have been 'realized' so that
cold-plugged cpus could get into 'peripheral' container. This would help
in hot-unplugging using the standard 'device_del' interface.

Earlier, I was not sure if there was any special significance to the
'unattached' container - which by the discussion it looks there is not
any and we could actually choose to place all of the cold-plugged vpus
as well in the 'peripheral' container. Please correct me here if I
have mis-understood anything here?

Now, assuming we are allowed to push all of the vcpus in the 'peripheral'
container then I could simply call unmodified qdev_set_id() just before
the 'realization' of the cold-plugged vcpus. And maybe we could generate
the cpus-ids using auto generate function which has been mentioned in the
link you shared and just like it is being done for the block devices.

Thoughts?
