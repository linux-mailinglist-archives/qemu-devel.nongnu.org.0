Hi, I'm running 5.5.

I've been playing around with some of the options, and if I run the
below, I end up with 2 files.

qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o
adapter_type=3Dlsilogic,subformat=3DmonolithicFlat -p "c:\test\AppD-
VM01.vmdk"

The files I get are:
AppD-VM01.vmdk (which is always 12kb)
AppD-VM01-flat.vmdk (which is the full size of the disk, eg 30GB).

If I then upload both of these files to the datastore, they somehow
merge into 1 and I can attach and power on the VM. If you dont upload
both files into the datastore, VMware does not recognise it.

This is the only method that seems to work for me.

Title:
  qemu-img created VMDK files lead to "Unsupported or invalid disk type
  7"

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Using qemu-img version 3.1.50 (v3.1.0-13607-geb2db0f7ba-dirty) on a
  Windows 10 machine.

  Converting a VHD to VMDK.
  qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=3Dbu=
slogic -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

  I have also tried:
  qemu-img.exe convert "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vhd" -O vmdk -o adapter_type=3Dbu=
slogic,hwversion=3D6 -p "c:\test\AppD-VM01.vmdk"

  Attaching the VMDK to a VM in VMware produces the following error when
  powering on.

  Power On virtual machine:Failed to open disk scsi0:1: Unsupported or inva=
lid disk type 7. Ensure that the disk has been imported.
  Target: MyVM1
  vCenter Server: VCENTER
  Error Stack
  An error was received from the ESX host while powering on VM MyVM1.

  If I do not specify the adapter type, it creates an IDE VMDK which works =
perfectly.
