I agree that it isn't possible in the MAINTAINERS file, as the level
of granularity is a very poor match for what we want to express.

My high level thought would be that we should ultimately be able to
have a build flag to request only security-critical code is built
into the binaries.

This is probably a bit too much of a stretch goal right now, but it
at least points towards maintaining the information on a per-file
level of granularity. There might be some individual files which
currently contain a mix security-critical/not-security critical
code. Either they can be split eventually, or we can simply declare
that the entire file is none the less security critical.

We could perhaps have a magic comment at the top of each file that
is security critical. eg

 /* @security: maintained */

we don't need any comment in files we consider non-maintained from
a security POV.  Eventually we could do some (insert hand waving)
magic in meson to pull out this list of comments and use it to
exclude build of files that are not security critical. Maybe we
find out that using a magic comment isn't the best option, but
at least if we start now by keeping a per-file comment, we can
probably do an automated transformation to any other data storage
later.
