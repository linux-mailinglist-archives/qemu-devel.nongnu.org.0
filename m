One already exists.  This patch would just make insertion way, way
faster by memoizing the subqueue heads.

Whoops, my bad, will fix the commit message for v2.

Sure, I'll do that in the v2 patch in the next mail.

I was trying to avoid churning the file more than absolutely
necessary.  There are 18 QTAILQ_FOREACH() loops in savevm.c right now.
Making ~15 of them double-loops doesn't make the code easier to read.

I think incurring slight complexity on insertion/removal to make
insertion fast is well worth the conceptual simplicity of addressing
one big list of elements for every other operation.

Yes, insertion becomes extremely obvious: you just append the element
to the tail of its priority queue, which must already exist.

But see above for the cost.

At maxmem=8T I'm seeing about 40000 elements in that list.  At
maxmem=64T I'm seeing around 262000.  The vast majority of these
elements are "spapr_drc" objects, each of which (IIRC) corresponds to
a 256MB chunk of address space.
