I use this thing maybe once a month at most, more likely once
every three months, and the documentation is notoriously
impenetrable. I really really don't want to have to start looking in it
and guessing about how the original author ran the script, when
they could have just told me.

So I need to now look in the git log for the script to find the commit
message? Why not just put the command in the file and save steps?

Yep, that command line would be great to see in the script file.

    // Usage:

    //        --macro-file scripts/cocci-macro-file.h \
    //        FILES ...

I think that should be about the minimum. I think every
.cocci file should say how it was used or is supposed to be used.
The least-effort way for the author of the script to do that is to
simply give the command line they used to run it.

How 'basic' is basic? I think that being specific is useful for
anybody who's at my level or lower (ie, can write a script, doesn't
do so often enough to be able to write a script or run spatch
without looking at documentation and cribbing from other scripts
as examples). How many people do we have at a higher level
than that for whom this is noise? 2? 3? And people who do
know Coccinelle well should have no difficulty in quickly
looking at a command line and mentally filtering out the options
that they don't feel they need.
