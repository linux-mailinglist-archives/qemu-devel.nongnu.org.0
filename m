Well, yes.  I generally put that under the idea of =E2=80=9CWe set
bs_opaque->stop, so we shouldn=E2=80=99t issue any further requests=E2=80=
=9D (which I
find implied by =E2=80=9Chas already dropped all permissions=E2=80=9D in =
your commit
message).

Yes, I do.  It makes immediate sense because of the bs_opaque->stop
concept.  As you explain yourself, mirror_top_bs dropped all
permissions, it mustn=E2=80=99t perform any further requests.  As such, i=
t must
be drained.

The problem for me is that we don=E2=80=99t actually care about whether t=
he
target is drained or not, do we?  Anyone can access it at basically any
point[1], we don=E2=80=99t care.

The point is that mirror must not perform any further requests.  Thus it
should be mirror_top_bs that=E2=80=99s drained.

[1] Maybe not during bdrv_replace_node(), even though I don=E2=80=99t qui=
te know
why.  Why do we care about other users of target accessing it while we
attach more parents to it?

That might be broken, but there could be a throttle node between src and
to_replace.  Not sure whether draining src would drain that, too.

But we don=E2=80=99t, actually, because bdrv_replace_node() already takes=
 care
of keeping @from drained.
