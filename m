I'm sorry it took me so long, I was expecting these patches to be picked
up by other maintainers but everybody is very busy. I know you'll need
to rebase and it might be painful. But I did that believing it is the
best I could give to the project with my current capacity. Also I don't
want to overlap (too much) into other (sub)maintained areas.
If you are stuck with a rebase, I can try to help.
We'll get to the end of PIIX, if this isn't this release, it will be
the next one. I've been waiting for these cleanups since 4 years
already, before Herv√© Poussineau pushed toward that direction during
3 years. We always hit problems due to PC world inheritance which,
as a production system, can not regress.

Also I don't want to compete with you guys, I'd really love to work
together as team, but I have other responsibilities and sometime I
can't spend the time I'd like here.

What blocks the PIIX changes is the "q35/ich9/-device piix3" broken
config. I'll explain elsewhere why it is broken. The problem is I
don't know how to suggest alternative.

Bernhard sometimes it is easier to share visions in a 30min call,
rather than on a such thread. If you want I'm open for one.
