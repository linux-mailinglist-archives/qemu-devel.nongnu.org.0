Thanks for v1 feedback.=0A=
=0A=
v2:=0A=
- Moved size+sign+endianness attributes from TCGMemOp into MemOp.=0A=
  In v1 TCGMemOp was re-purposed entirely into MemOp.=0A=
- Replaced MemOp MO_{8|16|32|64} with TCGMemOp MO_{UB|UW|UL|UQ} alias.=0A=
  This is to avoid warnings on comparing and coercing different enums.=0A=
- Renamed get_memop to get_tcgmemop for clarity.=0A=
- MEMOP is now SIZE_MEMOP, which is just ctzl(size). =0A=
- Split patch 3/4 so one memory_region_dispatch_{read|write} interface=0A=
  is converted per patch.=0A=
- Do not reuse TLB_RECHECK, use new TLB_FORCE_SLOW instead.=0A=
- Split patch 4/4 so adding the MemTxAddrs parameters and converting=0A=
  tlb_set_page() to tlb_set_page_with_attrs() is separate from usage.=0A=
- CC'd maintainers.=0A=
