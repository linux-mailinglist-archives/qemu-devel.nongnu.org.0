I haven't seen another response, but I just noticed a 'last call' for =
5.1.  If this means something is going to get excluded from regular =
build tests, that seems important - I for one have no objection to =
simply reverting this - 1b7157be3a8c4300fc8044d40f4b2e64a152a1b4 <-- my =
"fix."

I will try to send a better fix along sometime soonish, but I probably =
won't get to that before 5.1.  If the nuisance of the trace-<pid> files =
is causing real-world problems for someone actually doing regular =
development, that seems more important than the command line issue, to =
me.  Just my $0.02.

Cheers, and sorry if your build dirs do end up littered again.=
