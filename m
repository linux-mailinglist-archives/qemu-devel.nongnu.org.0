Hi Paolo,

I implemented what you proposed using VMX-preemption timer in Pin-based
controls and regular hv_vcpu_run(). It works fine without noticable
regressions, I'll send that in v2.

hv_vcpu_run_until() was also evaluated on macOS 10.15.5 but it degrades
VM performance significantly compared to explicit setting of
VMX-preepmtion timer value and hv_vcpu_run(). The performance issue was
observed on Broadwell-based MacBook Air and Ivy Bridge-based MacBook
Pro.

macOS 11.0 Beta deprecated hv_vcpu_run() and introduced a special
declaration for hv_vcpu_run_until(), that's not available 10.15 -
HV_DEADLINE_FOREVER (UINT64_MAX, which is bigger than maximum value of
VMX-preeemption counter). Perhaps the performance issue is addressed
there.

Regards,
Roman
