I.e. you mean that this should simply be stateful instead of
re-affirming the current state with a parameter?

The problem I see is that transferring states in different phases of
migration will require specialized implementations.Â  So running
SET_DEVICE_STATE_FD in a different phase will require support from the
back-end.Â  Same in the front-end, the exact protocol and thus
implementation will (probably, difficult to say at this point) depend on
the migration phase.Â  I would therefore prefer to have an explicit
distinction in the command itself that affirms the phase weâ€™re
targeting.

On the other hand, I donâ€™t see the parameter complicating anything. The
front-end must supply it, but it will know the phase anyway, so this is
easy.Â  The back-end can just choose to ignore it, if it doesnâ€™t feel the
need to verify that the phase is what it thinks it is.

Well, it would rather be `set_state_send_fd` and `set_state_receive_fd`.
We always negotiate a pipe between front-end and back-end, the question
is just whether the back-end gets the receiving (load) or the sending
(save) end.

Technically, one can make it fully stateful and say that if the device
hasnâ€™t been started already, itâ€™s always a LOAD, and otherwise always a
SAVE.Â  But as above, Iâ€™d prefer to keep the parameter because the
implementations are different, so Iâ€™d prefer there to be a
re-affirmation that front-end and back-end are in sync about what should
be done.

Personally, I donâ€™t really see the advantage of having two functions
instead of one function with an enum with two values.Â  The thing about
SET_DEVICE_STATE_FD is that it itself wonâ€™t differ much regardless of
whether weâ€™re loading or saving, it just negotiates the pipe â€“ the
difference is what happens after the pipe has been negotiated.Â  So if we
split the function into two, both implementations will share most of
their code anyway, which makes me think it should be a single function.

Iâ€™m not sure what you mean (because I donâ€™t know the VFIO code, I
assume).Â  Are you saying that using a more finely grained
migration_set_state() model would conflict with the rather coarse
suspend/resume?

> BTW, is there any usage for *reply_fd at this moment from the backend?

No, virtiofsd doesnâ€™t plan to make use of it.
