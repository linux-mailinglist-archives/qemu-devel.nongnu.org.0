OK, that's easy then.

Hmm 'when' during an incoming migration; I ask because of userfaultfd
setup for postcopy.  Also note those things can combine - i.e. a reboot
that happens during a migration (we've already got a pile of related
bugs).

I guess for a memory listener it just sees a new layout after the commit
and then can figure out what changed.
