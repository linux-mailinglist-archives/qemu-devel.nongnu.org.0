It shouldn't make a difference actually because deprecation in 4.1 means
that 4.2 (in December) will be the last release that must still support
Python 2, and we can switch to Python 3 for 5.0.

Actually I seem to remember I suggested that we should make 3.5 the
minimum Python 3 version, and I thought a patch to this effect had been
merged, but now I can't find any such check in configure. Maybe I should
find the old thread again to see if there was any reason not to do this.

Personally, I would have preferred 3.6 because it brings in variable
annotations, but I think last time the conclusion was that it would be
3.5 indeed.
