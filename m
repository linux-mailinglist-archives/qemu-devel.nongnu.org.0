I feel like I already considered that, maybe even tried it, a few months
ago when I first looked at this. I must have decided against it for some
reason at the time, but I don't recall what. Now I can say the reason is
because we only do this save/restore when we transition to/from paused
state, though.

per-VM would make sense, because the counters should be synchronized
among the VCPUs. KVM does that for us, though, so whichever VCPU last
restores its counter is the one that will determine the final value.

Maybe we should have a VM ioctl instead, but ATM we only have VCPU ioctls.

Thanks,
