May have a look but first sight it might work for sam460ex but not for the 
mac_oldworld problem as described above without duplicating size checks in 
board code that I'd like to avoid and have it only in spd_data_generate 
for clarity and avoiding mistakes in duplicated copies. What the above 
could be good for is to avoid unused RAM area but that's not related to 
spd_data_generate and if it returns error some way or asserts.

I think the problem with fix up was that memdev will allocate mem region 
and it does not have a callback for the board to apply fixup or any other 
way to specify constraints so by the time board code runs the memory 
region is already allocated with the user specified size so all the board 
code can do is use that or abort (or not use and waste some amount). Maybe 
s390x wasn't converted to this or using it differently?
