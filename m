That would help if you answer all questions (so I don't have to guess)
and explain why you decide to say "no", so I don't have to ask you
for details.

So I don't understand why you treat "upstream" as only owned by MIPS
enterprise. Aurelien put me here to represent the hobbyist users.
You can not simply say "no", we have to discuss and get a consensus
for the best of all the community, not only your company/employer.
This is not always easy, but this is open source, you have to work
in the open with other contributors, and can not only dictate.
