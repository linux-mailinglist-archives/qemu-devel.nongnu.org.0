The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting the bug state to "Incomplete" now.

If the bug has already been fixed in the latest upstream version of QEMU,
then please close this ticket as "Fix released".

If it is not fixed yet and you think that this bug report here is still
valid, then you have two options:

1) If you already have an account on gitlab.com, please open a new ticket
for this problem in our new tracker here:

    https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues

and then close this ticket here on Launchpad (or let it expire auto-
matically after 60 days). Please mention the URL of this bug ticket on
Launchpad in the new ticket on GitLab.

2) If you don't have an account on gitlab.com and don't intend to get
one, but still would like to keep this ticket opened, then please switch
the state back to "New" or "Confirmed" within the next 60 days (other-
wise it will get closed as "Expired"). We will then eventually migrate
the ticket automatically to the new system (but you won't be the reporter
of the bug in the new system and thus you won't get notified on changes
anymore).

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  User mode networking not working properly on QEMU on Mac OS X host

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Steps to reproduce:

  1. Install QEMU using homebrew on Mac OS X (I tried on Catalina and Big S=
ur)
  2. Spin up a guest VM (say) Cent OS 8 using user mode networking.
  3. Install podman inside the guest
  4. Run podman pull alpine

  The result is:

  [root@localhost ~]# podman pull alpine
  Resolved "alpine" as an alias (/etc/containers/registries.conf.d/shortnam=
es.conf)
  Trying to pull docker.io/library/alpine:latest...
  Getting image source signatures
  Copying blob ba3557a56b15 [=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D] 2.7M=

  =C2=A0=C2=A0unexpected EOF
  Error: Error writing blob: error storing blob to file "/var/tmp/storage85=
1171596/1": error happened during read: unexpected EOF

  This is happening because QEMU is telling the guest that the TCP
  connection is closed even before reading all the data from the host
  socket and forwarding it to the guest.

  This issue doesn't happen on a Linux host. So, that tells me that this
  has something to do with QEMU installation on Mac OS X.

  This could be a slirp related issue. So, QEMU/slirp may need to work
  together on fixing this. Here's the link to the libslirp issue:

  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/-/issues/35
