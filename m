@sanjaybmd

I'm glad to read that it worked for you. In fact, since I posted the XML
I didn't have the time to do benchmarking, now my motherboard is dead
and I have to wait for repair/replacement.

Do you have any data to quantify the performance gain?

As to the number of cores, you will notice that my 3900X has only 12
physical cores, that is 24 threads. Yet I assigned 32 vcpus in total. 8
of them are disabled. This is to align the vcpus to the actual CCX
topology of 3 cores per CCX.

QEMU thinks the cores per CCX should be a multiple of 2, e.g. 2, 4, etc.
cores. So I assign 4 cores =3D 8 vcpus, and disable 2 vcpus to simulate
the actual topology.

If your CPU has more cores, you could scale it up. Be aware that the
3950X should not have this issue as it has 4 cores per CCX, if I
remember correctly.

Note: I took this idea from a Reddit post (see link somewhere above).

Title:
  Cache Layout wrong on many Zen Arch CPUs

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  AMD CPUs have L3 cache per 2, 3 or 4 cores. Currently, TOPOEXT seems
  to always map Cache ass if it was an 4-Core per CCX CPU, which is
  incorrect, and costs upwards 30% performance (more realistically 10%)
  in L3 Cache Layout aware applications.

  Example on a 4-CCX CPU (1950X /w 8 Cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0=C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'8' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  In windows, coreinfo reports correctly:

  ****----  Unified Cache 1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----****  Unified Cache 6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  On a 3-CCX CPU (3960X /w 6 cores and no SMT):

  =C2=A0<cpu mode=3D'custom' match=3D'exact' check=3D'full'>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<model fallback=3D'forbid'>EPYC-IBPB</model>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<vendor>AMD</vendor>
  =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0<topology sockets=3D'1' cores=3D'6' threads=3D'1'=
/>

  in windows, coreinfo reports incorrectly:

  ****--  Unified Cache  1, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64
  ----**  Unified Cache  6, Level 3,    8 MB, Assoc  16, LineSize  64

  Validated against 3.0, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 versions of qemu-kvm.

  With newer Qemu there is a fix (that does behave correctly) in using the =
dies parameter:
  =C2=A0<qemu:arg value=3D'cores=3D3,threads=3D1,dies=3D2,sockets=3D1'/>

  The problem is that the dies are exposed differently than how AMD does
  it natively, they are exposed to Windows as sockets, which means, that
  if you are nto a business user, you can't ever have a machine with
  more than two CCX (6 cores) as consumer versions of Windows only
  supports two sockets. (Should this be reported as a separate bug?)
