So I only followed the discussion loosely, but tried some simple reproducing
to ensure it was an issue independent of some artifacts on Dietmar's setup.

Before that patch I got always a hang before reaching the fifth drive-backup
+ block-job-cancel cycle. With your patch applied I had no hang so far,
currently into >885 cycles (and yes I confirmed stress -d 5 was really
running).

So, FWIW, the patch definitively fixes the issue or at least the symptoms
here, I cannot comment on its correctness or the like at all, as I'm
currently missing to much background.

cheers,
Thomas
