It's not entirely what I was thinking about but it is interesting anyway 
so thanks for writing that.  Sorry it took some time to reply but these 
live migration issues are subtle and I wanted to be sure of what is and 
isn't a problem.

The issue with live migration is that the setup data changes from before 
to after the patches.  This means that a live migration exactly _in the 
middle_ of reading the Linux boot data could fail badly.  For example, 
you could migrate in the middle of reading the DTB, and it would be 
shifted by the ~50 bytes of the setup_data and seed.  The size would 
also not match so, even though probably things would mostly work if you 
place the seed last, that's not really optimal either.

Now I understand that this would be exceedingly unlikely or downright 
impossible, but the main issue is that, roughly speaking, we try to 
guarantee unchanged guest ABI on every execution with the appropriate 
command line options.  So the solution is to add a machine property 
(e.g. "-M linuxboot-seed=...") that allows enabling/disabling it, and 
then making it default to off with machine types like pc-i440fx-7.0 that 
never had the seed.

In turn this means that the "shape" of the linked list changes a bit and 
it's better to abstract the creation of the setup_data struct in a 
separate function.  And then you've got to move the various local 
variables of x86_load_linux into a struct for sharing.  As I said, it 
snowballs a bit, but I should be sending out patches later today.

As an aside, QEMU tends to only include code after Linux supports it, 
but it's in your rng tree so the timing is right; I'll queue the FDT 
ones for 7.1 since it's nice to have feature parity across all FDT boards.

Paolo
