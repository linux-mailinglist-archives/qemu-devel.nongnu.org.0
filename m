Sure the runtime check should be quick so likely the approach would be to 
write detailed tests to profile different FPU implementations then only 
include one quick check to tell at runtime if we're running on a known 
good host. Maybe if someone knows the different FPUs can tell this without 
tests but I don't know and finding out from docs seems more work than 
determining it empirically by testing. Does someone have some hints on 
what operations should be tested to check for different inexact handling 
in different FPUs?

Only if inexact is set which may be common but still not using softfloat 
ar all if host's implementation is good for guest could be even faster.

I think that's an additional optimisation that could be done once the 
simple case of just rerunning last op if flags are accessed works. Just to 
keep complexity low first then try more complex solution. (Although I'm 
not planning to try to do this so whatever complexity can be handled by 
whom will implement it is fine but less complexity means less bugs so I'd 
go for simple first.)

Is checking for those exceptions beforehand really needed? Wouldn't it be 
easier to install an exception handler and let the hardware do those 
checks? It this is again done because of FPU implemenation differences but 
inexact is determined by looking at the FP status (that's why it's cleared 
on PPC) then that means that we always use the hosts inexact semantics and 
don't emulate guest correctly anyway, so we can skip the tests above. Then 
why can't we install an exception handler and set guest bits whenever 
that's raised?
