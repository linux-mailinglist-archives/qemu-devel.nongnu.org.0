I'm worried that SIGEV_THREAD could be a bit heavyweight (if it fires
up a new thread each time). On the other hand, as you said, SIGKILL
makes it harder to debug.

Also, asking the kernel to defer the SIGKILL (ie. updating the timer)
needs to come from Qemu itself (eg. a timer in the main loop,
something we already ruled unsuitable, or a qmp command which
constitutes an external dependency that we also ruled undesirable).

What if, when self-fencing is enabled, Qemu kicks off a new thread
from the start which does nothing but periodically wake up, verify the
heartbeat condition and log()+abort() if required? (Then we wouldn't
need the kernel timer.)

This qmp approach is slightly different than the external dependency
that itself kills Qemu; if it doesn't run, then Qemu dies because the
kernel timer is not updated. But this is also a heavyweight approach.
We are talking about a service that needs to frequently connect to all
running VMs on a host to reset the timer.

But it does allow for the customisable heartbeat: the logic behind
what triggers the command is completely flexible.

Thinking about this idea of a separate Qemu thread, one thing that
came to mind is this:

qemu -fence heartbeat=3D/path/to/file,deadline=3D60[,recheck=3D5]

Qemu could fire up a thread that stat()s <file> (every <recheck>
seconds or on a default interval) and log()+abort() the whole process
if the last modification time of the file is older than <deadline>. If
<file> goes away (ie. stat() gives ENOENT), then it either fences
immediately or ignores it, not sure which is more sensible.

Thoughts?
