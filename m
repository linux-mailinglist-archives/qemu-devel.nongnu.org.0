Yep sorry for that. I was trying to fix the issue quickly for unblocking
the series for 4.1.

Actually it looks really weird as the test is passing on some hosts
(Igor is currently experiencing it). At the beginning I was not able to
reproduce Peter's issue and eventually after many various tweaks in the
environment I was able to. I used the script to regenerate the DSDT and
this definitively fixes the issue for me. Now we are not sure this isn't
an issue in the test itself.

Thanks

Eric
