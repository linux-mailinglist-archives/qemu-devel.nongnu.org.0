I'm not sure I get what you mean.

Most headers failing the test fail it in the first #include: they fail
to conform to 2. Headers should normally include everything they need
beyond osdep.h.

The only way to fail in the second #include is a missing header guard.
If it's missing intentionally, it's "_meant_ to be included many times",
and you propose renaming to .inc.h.  Else, easy fix.

I think I'll make a list of headers that fail in the second #include,
and try to sort them into "intentional" and "bug" buckets.
