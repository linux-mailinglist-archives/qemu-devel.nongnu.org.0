The section on date based versioning continues with

  A key advantage of date based versioning is that it is
  straightforward to tell how old the base feature set of a
  particular release is given just the version number.

  Version numbers for date based projects typically take the form of
  YEAR.MONTH (for example, 12.04, 15.10).

The problem with QEMU's version numbers is that, while they are date
based, they still *look* like semver, so it wouldn't be at all
unreasonable for the user to expect that they also *behave* like
semver.

This is not much of a problem when it comes to the main binary, but
it is certainly much more confusing when you start using the same
version number for a Python library.

The problem comes from the expectations: a Python programmer, who is
used to semver due to its prominence on PyPi, when deciding whether
to move from qemu.core 4.2.0 to 5.0.0 might expect to need code
changes to cope with API-breaking changes - where in fact there are
none, and at the same time might expect upgrading to 5.2.0 from 5.0.0
to be completely straightforward when in reality a feature their
application depends on might have been removed after the usual
deprecation period.
