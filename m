Well, so far, the preference seems to be to go through a more verbose
approach with an explicit table of functions.

What the preprocessor code did was:

- If you build without modules, nothing changes, you get a direct call

- If you build with modules:

 + In the DSO, foo is replaced with foo_implementation
 + Elsewhere, foo is replaced with a function pointer also called foo.
 + The implementation adds constructor code that sets foo to point to foo_implementation

So far, I've only integrated Gerd's workaround for target-specific
modules. Some additional mechanics is needed to name target-specific
modules, e.g. put them in some target directory.

It's probably because the modules you were dealing with already had the
required indirection and module_init calls, i.e. they were only invoked
using QOM already.

The mechanism I was proposing is to quickly add the indirection for
qemu functionality that does not have such indirect calls yet.

The consensus so far seems to be that the syntax I proposed is not nice, and
that it's better to make it more explicit through a table and indirect
calls, even if that means changing the call sites.
