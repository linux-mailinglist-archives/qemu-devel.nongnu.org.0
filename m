I ran out of time, but I was briefly entertaining the idea of hitting
everything else in the iotests folder with the pylint and mypy beam.

This is just a draft of what I had at the time, in case someone gets
around to it before I do.

I forced all of the python scripts in this directory to Python3 and pass
the formatter check imposed by the pylintrc that we make iotests.py
adhere to, but there's no guarantee these scripts actually work. I was a
little rough around the edges.

qed.py and qcow2.py in particular abuse some python features that pylint
really doesn't like to see at all, and forcing these to pass a pylint
check was clearly fighting against the idioms in-use in those files,
with more than a few unsatisfactory hacks employed just to make pylint
shut up. They are not necessarily improvements to those scripts.

I created a Makefile check to hit the iotests themselves with the pylint
checker so we can identify when refactors to the testing infrastructure
invalidate tests we don't get to run that often; but didn't get around
to improving the quality of the tests themselves.

(Whether or not this is even worth our time is debatable, it depends on
how much effort it would take to bring them up to par. Maybe it's a lot,
I don't know.)
