Indeed, but I have to refer to the manual to remind myself of whether = 
or := is what I want in a given situation.

It's more verbose.  My suggestion was more:

GENERATED_QGA_BASENAMES := qga-qapi-types.c qga-qapi-types.h
GENERATED_QGA_BASENAMES += qga-qapi-visit.c qga-qapi-visit.h
...
GENERATED_QGA_FILES := $(addprefix qga/qapi-generated/, 
$(GENERATED_QGA_BASENAMES))

to avoid the reassignment-to-self issue altogether, while still 
remaining concise compared to longhand.
