Ok.

No. The documentation of the function says "Compressed clusters are
always processed one by one but for the purpose of this count they are
treated as if they were divided into subclusters of size
s->subcluster_size".

Let's say we have a compressed cluster at offset 0 (size 64k) and we
perform a read request with offset=32k, size=8k.

qcow2_co_preadv_part() calls qcow2_get_host_offset() and asks "How many
bytes up to 8k can we read in one go at offset 32k?".

The offset is 32k so the first subcluster is #16. And this function
(count_contiguous_subclusters()) is asked "how many contiguous
subclusters do we have starting at subcluster #16?" and the answer is
32 - 16 = 16 subclusters.

qcow2_get_host_offset() only needs 8k/2k = 4 subclusters, so it tells
the original caller (qcow2_co_preadv_part()) "you can read all 8k in one
go and the subcluster type is _COMPRESSED".

Correct.

Not really. The old code had three different cases in the switch()
block:

- Compressed clusters: return always 1.

- Unallocated / zero_plain: count the number of clusters of the exact
  same type (one of the parameters was 'wanted_type').

- Normal / zero_alloc: count the number of clusters of type normal or
  zero_alloc that are contiguous on the image file **but stop** if the
  QCOW_OFLAG_ZERO flag changes. In other words, count contiguous
  clusters of the same type.

The new code simply merges all three cases in the same function. It
could be done even without having subclusters.

Plus, the old function was also returning the cluster type, so it had to
be the same one for the whole region.

Note that the functions in this patch that you're reviewing are
concerned with read requests, not write requests.
