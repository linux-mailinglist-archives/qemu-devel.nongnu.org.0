Well, if you try to build logic like introspection on top for a 
sophisticated hardware, you probably need to have library on top. And 
it's attribute per file is pretty inefficient.

Kernel provides stable ABI for userspace, so it's not something that we 
can't fix.

I believe you can't change sysfs layout which is part of uABI. But as I 
mentioned below, sysfs has several drawbacks. It's not harm to compare 
between different approach when you start a new device management API.
