Minimally, you need to say:
 * this architecture follows version x of the Arm semihosting
   spec [and give URL]
 * specify the equivalent things to the 'The semihosting interface'
   part of the Arm spec:
    - instruction that causes the trap
    - what the OPERATION NUMBER REGISTER, PARAMETER REGISTER
      and RETURN REGISTER are for your architecture
    - what the data block field size is (32 or 64 bit)
 * say whether your SYS_EXIT is doing the silly 32-bit Arm
   thing or the more sensible allow-app-to-specify-exit-status
   64-bit Arm thing (you should choose the latter!)
 * if you want to make either of the 'semihosting extensions'
   (which fix missing features) mandatory, say so here
 * does your architecture need to define some SYS_EXIT
   codes? The Arm ones have a lot of arm-specific stuff
   like "stopped because of prefetch abort"...

It's hard if you don't do it from the start. This is why the
Arm spec's feature-query API is "open a magic filename" --
we couldn't guarantee that existing implementations wouldn't
blow up/crash/etc if the guest code attempted a new "query
feature" semihosting call that didn't exist. If you can
reliably say "all implementations of semihosting for this
arch will fail ENOSYS on unknown semihosting calls", or if
you put in a get-feature-flags call from the start, you don't
have that problem. Otherwise you're stuck with doing it the
way the Arm version does (which requires your implementation
to actually track file handles so it can distinguish "magic
feature-flag file" from "normal host file"; it can't just
pass through host fds/handles to the guest).

Similarly, actually specifying errnos is only easy if you do it
before any implementations.

The problem is if you do "call" and then the implementation
does "kill the VM" or "drop the user into the debugger"...
