Oh, so that=E2=80=99s the way it works.  I thought =E2=80=9Calways=E2=80=9D=
 meant that you can
repeat the backup.  But it just means you keep your partial backup and
pretend it=E2=80=99s a full incremental one.

Now that I think about it again...  Yeah, you can=E2=80=99t repeat a back=
up at a
later point, of course.  If data is gone in the meantime, it=E2=80=99s go=
ne.

So, uh, I was wrong that it=E2=80=99s all good, because it would have bee=
n
wrong?  But thankfully I was just wrong myself, and so it is all good
after all?  My confusion with bitmaps as lifted, now I=E2=80=99m just con=
fused
with myself.

I revoke my R-b and give a new one:

Or something like that.

Again, thanks a lot for clarifying.
