I think you already do, in do_qmp_dispatch():

    assert(!(oob && qemu_in_coroutine()));

Not sure that's the best spot.  Let's see when I review PATCH 3.

I'm asking you not to mix documenting existing code with adding a
new feature to it in the same patch.

Hopefully, that won't lead to the documentation getting dropped for
good.  That would be sad.
