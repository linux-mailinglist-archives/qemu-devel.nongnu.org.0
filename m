Hi,

after a discussion with Igor I'm preparing patches which take the
'props' verbatim and use it for hotplug. It's a fairly simple change in
libvirt. Originally I've opted to reconstruct the props from internal
data since it was simpler as the values were already parsed into
internal structures anyways.

With some persuation we could even get it into libvirt during the freeze
so that with new libvirt the released stuff will not break any more.
