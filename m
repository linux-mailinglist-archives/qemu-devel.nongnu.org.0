| A supposed exploit of QEMU was recently announced as CVE-2019-12928
| claiming that the monitor console was insecure because the "migrate"
| command enabled arbitrary command execution for a remote attacker.
|=20
| To be a security risk the user launching QEMU must have configured
| the monitor in a way that allows for other users to access it. The
| exploit report quoted use of the "tcp" character device backend for
| QMP.
|=20
| This would indeed allow any network user to connect to QEMU and
| execute arbitrary commands, however, this is not a flaw in QEMU.
| It is the normal expected behaviour of the monitor console and the
| commands it supports. Given a monitor connection, there are many
| ways to access host filesystem content besides the migrate command.

filesystem -> file system ?

| The reality is that the monitor console (whether QMP or HMP) is
| considered a privileged interface to QEMU and as such must only
| be made available to trusted users. IOW, making it available with
| no authentication over TCP is simply a, very serious, user
| configuration error not a security flaw in QEMU itself.
|=20
| The one thing this bogus security report highlights though is that
| we have not clearly documented the security implications around the
| use of the monitor. Add a few paragraphs of text to the security
| docs explaining why the monitor is a privileged interface and making
| a recommendation to only use the UNIX socket character device backend.

| +There are aspects of QEMU that can have non-obvious security implicati=
ons
| +which users & management applications must be aware of.
| +
| +@subsection Monitor console (QMP and HMP)
| +
| +The monitor console (whether used with QMP or HMP) provides an RPC int=
erface
| +to dynamically control many aspects of QEMU's runtime operation. Many =
of the
| +commands exposed will instruct QEMU to access content on the host file=
sysystem

filesysystem -> file system ?

| +and/or trigger spawning of external processes.
| +
| +For example, the @code{migrate} command allows for the spawning of arb=
itrary
| +processes for the purpose of tunnelling the migration data stream. The
| +@code{blockdev-add} command instructs QEMU to open arbitrary files, ex=
posing
| +their content to the guest as a virtual disk.
| +
| +Unless QEMU is otherwise confined using technologies such as SELinux, =
AppArmor,
| +or Linux namespaces, the monitor console should be considered to have =
privileges
| +equivalent to those of the user account QEMU is running under.
| +
| +It is further important to consider the security of the character devi=
ce backend
| +over which the monitor console is exposed. It needs to have protection=
 against
| +malicious third parties which might try to make unauthorized connectio=
ns, or
| +perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Many of the character device backen=
ds do not
| +satisfy this requirement and so must not be used for the monitor conso=
le.
| +
| +The general recommendation is that the monitor console should be expos=
ed over
| +a UNIX domain socket backend to the local host only. Use of the TCP ba=
sed
| +character device backend is inappropriate unless configured to use bot=
h TLS
| +encryption and authorization control policy on client connections.
| +
| +In summary, the monitor console is considered a privileged control int=
erface to
| +QEMU and as such should only be made accessible to a trusted managemen=
t
| +application or user.
