Curious.  I could swear I'd already dealt with multiple copies of this
message coming over vhost-user and having to deal with it when it did.
But now I'm confused, isn't vq_index a unique number per queue, so is
this really stopping it happening multiple times, or just making sure it
only happens for the first queue?
