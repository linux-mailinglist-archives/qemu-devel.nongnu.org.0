Isn't the real bug that we keep pointing to a node that isn't a parent
of the node any more? I think this will effectively disable option
inheritance in bdrv_reopen() as long as the filter node is present,
which is certainly not what we intended.

The intuitive thing would be that after inserting a filter, the image
now inherits from the filter node, and when the filter is removed, it
inherits from the filter's bs->inherit_from if that becomes a parent of
the node. (Though I'm not necessarily saying that my intuition is to be
trusted here.)
