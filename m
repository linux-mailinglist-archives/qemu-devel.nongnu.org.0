Perhaps; but I think we're also genuinely disagreeing.

It tells the reader that the original author only tested
the script to work inside block/, which is useful information.
(This is why scripts/coccinelle/cpu-reset.cocci specifies
--dir target in its command.)

I'm a future user; in fact I'm the future user whose needs I have
the best information on. I want to see the whole command, please.

I'm certainly not arguing against having a README which helps
people with onboarding into the world of coccinelle scripts;
I think that would be great. I just don't really see much benefit
to either authors or script readers in asking authors to do more
than quote the coccinelle command line they used in the
comments at the top of their script.
