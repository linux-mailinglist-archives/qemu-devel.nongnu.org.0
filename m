We're not building a home grown SCM as part of a test script, so
this answer is irrelevant.

If someone wants to make git suck less with submodules great, but needs
someone to actually do the work.

Again needs someone to actually make it happen.

Meanwhile  QEMU already has an integrated test harness in the form
of Avocado that does everything needed. If Avocado had just been
used for this biosbits test in the first place, the test would
likely have already been merged to QEMU, instead of us having this
never ending debate on how to re-invent an alternative to what
already avocado does.

Daniel
