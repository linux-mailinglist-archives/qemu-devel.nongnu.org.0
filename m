What do you mean by "read value stops changing values"?

I assume I have to write the CPU index (in incrementing fashion) to
offset 0 in the register block.

- What byte order?
- What offset / width do I need to read back? What endianness? :)
- What is the expected value once I run out of the possible CPU range?

(I tried to figure these out from "docs/specs/acpi_cpu_hotplug.txt", but
I can't find the answers in it. Apologies.)

Other than that, I'm fine with this method. Hopefully the IO port
accesses (on every boot) won't slow down the boot much (esp. in SEV
guests, where they are more costly).

(Done in the subsequent message, but I'll answer here too, below.)

This would be very nice.

For the hotplug use case, the internal structure / topology of the
APIC-ID actually appears irrelevant. What's needed is that the "host
CPU", handling the hotplug SMI, can *somehow* deduce the APIC-ID of the
new CPU. (The edk2 code suggests that, on physical platforms, the RAS
controller passes the new APIC-ID the the "host CPU".) The edk2
infrastructure uses APIC-ID's as the unique key for identifying CPUs.

The topology info was supposed to allow OVMF to calculate the APIC-ID
from scratch, based on the sequential CPU index (retrieved from the ACPI
hotplug register block).

Thanks, that's appreciated :)

Sure, I don't insist.

If the hotplug register block can expose the APIC-IDs as "opaque"
integers, and they match the APIC-IDs read on the actual processors,
things should work.

Thanks,
