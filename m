And maybe even auto-read-only.  As for @writable vs. @read-only, that's 
a choice of spelling, but we don't want both; there's also the question 
of which default is saner (having to opt-in to allowing writes is more 
verbose than defaulting to allowing writes when possible, but arguably 
saner as it is less risk of unintended writes when you forgot to specify 
the option; @auto-read-only can help in choosing nicer defaults).

NBD isn't resizable yet, but extending the protocol to let it become so 
is on my TODO list.
