Makes sense to me. So deprecate nbd-server-add in 5.2, and require 
block-export in 6.1.

Works for me. Keeping the warts backwards-compatible in nbd-server-add 
is more palatable if we know we are going to drop it wholesale down the 
road.

No, I'm fine with the idea of getting rid of nbd-server-add, at which 
point changing it before removal is pointless.
