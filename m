You would think so but unfortunately iOS likes to be "special"

In the original incarnation of this code from a year ago, this was the
chosen path, but we ran into other issues which unfortunately were not
recorded anywhere. I think one issue is that the mirror offset has to
be stored somewhere that can easily be retrieved or otherwise code and
structs have to be modified to take a copy of the value. If we default
to the RW copy, there may be less LOC changes but the changes will be
more significant. This version has also been running by iOS users for
the past year or so without issue and a major change in the logic
would probably require a lot more testing.

Okay, I will do that.
