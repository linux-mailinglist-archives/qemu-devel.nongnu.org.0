Because docstring directives are searched for "gracefully", that is,
if it doesn't match the pattern, it's not considered a docstring
directive.

Also, there's nothing in the jobs that require or check for that
specific machine tag.  The "check-acceptance" rule uses the built
targets, and adds "arch:<$TARGET>" tags to the command line.

Now, if one run this (as exemplified in the commit message):

  $ avocado run -t machine:emcraft-sf2 tests/acceptance

The *tag* failure/limitation would have been noticed.  BTW, it should
be easy to expand the docstring directive pattern and fix this
limitation on newer Avocado versions.

You can also see the parsed key/val tags with:

  $ avocado list -V tests/acceptance

Although only on new Avocado versions (>69.0), you can also see the
parsed key:val tags.

Or ammended it?  It's a minor issue IMO (s/-/_/).

I get your point, and I'd love to have no "no learning wheels" mode
too.  But given that the "safe loader" was a very basic architecture
design, and we probably wouldn't be dropping it, this means twice the
code to maintain.

I'd be interested in collecting more use cases (besides this s/-/_/)
to better justify such an effort.
