I'll probably be working on making sure CI runs in a virtual environment 
with specifically pinned versions.

We don't need mypy to run or build, so I have been less worried about 
requiring bleeding edge versions for development and regression testing.

It is indeed very cutting edge. It wasn't really viable to use until 
Python 3.6.

The pattern we have is roughly correct; it's just that we rely on that 
implicit explosion, which mypy will warn about if I don't disable this 
option.

It's not worth addressing in our first pass, but if you look at 
schema.py's @property ifcond code, that's the type of thing that would 
"fix" this warning -- basically access shims that add a "real" error 
message when it's None, but convert the return type from Optional[T] to T.

It's later stuff.
