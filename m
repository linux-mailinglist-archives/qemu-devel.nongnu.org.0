We are talking about something that probably does not happen, but what
if it calls a callback similar to .set_aio_context that goes through the
whole graph?

Even though the first question is: is there such callback?

Second even more irrealistic case is when a job randomly looks for a bs
in another connectivity component and for example drains it.
Again probably impossible.

What do you mean with "own"?

But the point is then: aren't we re-inventing an AioContext lock?
the lock will protect not only ->parents and ->child, but also other
bdrv fields that are concurrently read/written.

I don't know, it seems to me that there is a lot of uncertainty on which
way to take...
