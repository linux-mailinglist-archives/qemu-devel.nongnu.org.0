So the warnings seem to depend a bit on which chip type we try to be to the=
 guest.
We can ignore them for now.

What stays is the emulation error on this kind of chip.
I'll try to write up some tests to check different qemu and kernel levels t=
o further corner what we are looking at.

  As outlined here:

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
