Prior attempt:
[PATCH 1/1] monitor: increase amount of data for monitor to read
Message-Id: <1493732857-10721-1-git-send-email-den@openvz.org>
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2017-05/msg00206.html

Review concluded that it breaks HMP command migrate without -d.  QMP is
probably okay.  Sadly, no v2.

Next one:
Subject: [PATCH] monitor: increase amount of data for monitor to read
Message-Id: <20190610105906.28524-1-dplotnikov@virtuozzo.com>
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-06/msg01912.html

Same patch, with a second, suspicious-looking hunk thrown in.  I didn't
make the connection to the prior attempt back then.  I wrote "I think I
need to (re-)examine how QMP reads input, with special consideration to
its OOB feature."

This patch is a cleaner variation on the same theme.  Its ramifications
are as unobvious as ever.

I figure the HMP situation is unchanged: not safe, although we could
probably make it safe if we wanted to (Daniel sketched how).  My simpler
suggestion stands: separate f_can_read() callbacks for HMP and QMP
[PATCH 1], then change only the one for QMP [PATCH 2].

The QMP situation is also unchanged: we still need to think through how
this affects reading of QMP input, in particular OOB.
