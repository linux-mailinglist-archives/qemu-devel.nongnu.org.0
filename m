Yes, it shouldn't even need Acked-by since there are other maintainers
that handle this part of the tree:

Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com> (maintainer:X86 TCG CPUs)
Richard Henderson <rth@twiddle.net> (maintainer:X86 TCG CPUs)
Eduardo Habkost <ehabkost@redhat.com> (maintainer:X86 TCG CPUs)
"Michael S. Tsirkin" <mst@redhat.com> (supporter:PC)
Marcel Apfelbaum <marcel.apfelbaum@gmail.com> (supporter:PC)
