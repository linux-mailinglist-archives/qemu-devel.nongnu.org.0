Yes, it could be used in the case of a successful live migration:
[started] -> vhost_dev_suspend() [suspended] -> vhost_dev_stop() [stopped]

Yes, in the case of a failed live migration:
[started] -> vhost_dev_suspend() [suspended] -> vhost_dev_resume() [started]

VHOST_USER_GET_VRING_BASE itself isn't really enough because it stops a
specific virtqueue but not the whole device. Unfortunately stopping all
virtqueues is not the same as SUSPEND since spontaneous device activity
is possible independent of any virtqueue (e.g. virtio-scsi events and
maybe virtio-net link status).

That's why I think SUSPEND is necessary for a solution that's generic
enough to cover all device types.

Yes, and that sounds like what Hanna is proposing for b) plus our
discussion about SUSPEND/RESUME in order to achieve a).
