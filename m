Hmm, that is a bit late for the final qemu 4.2 release (see
https://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/4.2).  But seabios 1.13 in qemu hasn't
seen any real testing so far: the update landed in -rc2 (tagged
yesterday) not -rc0 due to the lchs patch series issues (late merge of
the qemu patches and ahci test failure).  So having a tested 1.13-final
in -rc3 is pretty much impossible, even -rc4 is ambitious and requires
tagging the seabios release on Dec 1st or 2nd (less than two weeks from
now).  Which would be nice from qemu point of view, but if this doesn't
work out sky isn't falling either.  We can also release qemu 4.2 with
the snapshot and update to 1.13-final in 4.2.1 ...

cheers,
  Gerd
