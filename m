There are 3 invalid states:
  *  101b => Invalid state
  *  110b => Invalid state
  *  111b => Invalid state

why only 110b should be used to report error from vendor driver to 
report error? Aren't we adding more confusions in the interface?

Only 3 bits from 32 bits are yet used, one bit can be spared to 
represent error state from vendor driver.

Thanks,
Kirti
