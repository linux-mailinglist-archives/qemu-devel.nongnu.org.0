There's one more mention of TCG_REG_R2 in tcg-target.inc.c 
tcg_target_init() function where it's set as call clobber but then later 
in same func again as reserved if _CALL_SYSV or 64 bits. Not sure if the 
later tcg_regset_set_reg overrides the first one or that should be removed 
or put in an #else of the later conditional call. (Still don't know what 
I'm talking about just trowing random ideas.)
