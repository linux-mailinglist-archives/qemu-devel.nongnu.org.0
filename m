Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue
with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  Latest Installer (qemu-w64-setup-20190807.exe) for windows immediately
  deletes installed files at the very end of the installation

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  This happens on Windows 10 with the latest installer for 64 bit
  Windows: qemu-w64-setup-20190807.exe

  On install it will create the files and go through all the typical
  functions of installing the software, at the very end step it will
  then delete all files the installer created.

  I looked for logs to see when was going on so I ran the installation
  in Sandboxie and was able to retain all the installed files but I
  couldn't find a log for the installer.

  Here is a screenshot of it deleting all the files at the end of the
  process.

  If goes too fast for me to see what is written in the text console
  otherwise I would post more information but this is all I have. It
  does not give any error or any other information at completion.

  This error does not occur in the earlier release:
  qemu-w64-setup-20190731.exe
