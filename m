I tweaked qboot a bit to make it work with microvm (basically, if it
can't identify a PCI vendor, it assumes it's running in a microvm, and
avoids PCI and ACPI initialization, writing an minimal mptable instead)
and I've just got some numbers:

Average boot time:
 qemu_init_end: 64.502199
 linux_start_kernel: 66.644311 (+2.142112)
 linux_start_user: 116.279127 (+49.634816)

To avoid having to scroll up, these are the numbers with the direct PVH
boot version:

Average boot time:
 qemu_init_end: 64.043264
 linux_start_kernel: 65.481782 (+1.438518)
 linux_start_user: 114.938353 (+49.456571)

So starting from qboot is just a bit over 1ms slower, which I think it's
quite reasonable. And, as you said, the only additional device is
fw_cfg:

address-space: I/O
  0000000000000000-000000000000ffff (prio 0, i/o): io
    000000000000007e-000000000000007f (prio 0, i/o): kvmvapic
    0000000000000510-0000000000000511 (prio 0, i/o): fwcfg
    0000000000000514-000000000000051b (prio 0, i/o): fwcfg.dma

If people feel more comfortable keeping QEMU on x86_64 starting on Real
Mode and having the firmware writing mptables, I'm fine with taking this
approach.

That said, to avoid confusing users, I think it'd be better to drop the
legacy mode for SeaBIOS, and support just qboot. That would mean having
to add a binary from the latter to "pc-bios" with some descriptive name
("qboot-microvm.bin"?) and making microvm look for that one by default.

Does this sound like a reasonable plan?
