(=E2=80=9Cmirror: Do not dereference invalid pointers=E2=80=9D)


Hi,

We have this function bdrv_is_first_non_filter(), and I don=E2=80=99t kno=
w what
we have it for exactly.  It=E2=80=99s used in three places:
1. To allow snapshots only on such nodes,
2. To allow resizing only on such nodes,
3. For check_to_replace_node().

In none of these places it=E2=80=99s clear why we=E2=80=99d want it.

For (1), snapshots should just work for every node that supports backing
nodes.  We have such checks in place, so we don=E2=80=99t need to call
bdrv_is_first_non_filter(); and it should be fine to snapshot nodes
somewhere down a backing chain, too.

For (2), bdrv_truncate() should work on any node.  There is no reason
why we=E2=80=99d prevent the user from invoking block_resize only on the =
first
non-filter in a chain.  We now have the RESIZE permission, and as long
as that can be taken, any node can be resized.

For (3), it is just wrong.  The main reason it was introduced here was
to replace broken Quorum children.  But Quorum isn=E2=80=99t actually a f=
ilter,
and that is evidenced precisely here: The user wants to replace a child
that *does not* match the overall quorum.  We need something else
entirely here, namely a special bdrv_recurse_can_replace() function.

That the current approach doesn=E2=80=99t actually work can be seen by at=
taching
some other parent to a Quorum child, and then trying to replace that
child; Quorum will happily agree, but nobody asked that other parent
what they think of suddenly changing the data on their child.

It isn=E2=80=99t wrong to let a node be replaced when there are only filt=
ers
between it and the source node (because then they must have the same
data).  What=E2=80=99s wrong is that Quorum calls itself a filter.

In the new .bdrv_recurse_can_replace(), Quorum can be more aware of all
of this.  So it verifies that there is noone else who might care about
sudden data change by unsharing CONSISTENT_READ and taking the WRITE
permission.


The second problem is that mirror never checked whether the combination
of mirror command (drive/blockdev), sync mode, and @replaces asks for a
loop.  While bdrv_replace_node() was fixed in commit
ec9f10fe064f2abb9dc60a9fa580d8d0933f2acf to never create loops, mirror
should still reject such a configuration because it will probably not
achieve what the user expects.


Other things this series does:
- Fix Quorum=E2=80=99s permissions: It cannot share WRITE or RESIZE permi=
ssions
  because that would break the Quorum
- Drop .is_filter =3D true from Quorum
- Add some tests


(In case you=E2=80=99re wondering, yes, this 22-patch series does replace=
 a
single patch from my 42-patch series =E2=80=9CDeal with filters=E2=80=9D.=
)
