QMP command handlers are guaranteed to run in the main thread with the
BQL held, so there is no concurrency. If you want to change this, you
would have much more complicated problems to solve than in this handler.
I'm not sure it's fair to require thread-safety from one handler when
no other handler is thread safe (except accidentally) and nobody seems
to plan actually calling them from multiple threads.

Anyway, what I really wanted to add:

This should be easy to solve by having a CoQueue instead of a single
Coroutine pointer. The coroutine would just call qemu_co_queue_wait(),
which adds itself to the queue before it yields and the update
completion would wake up all coroutines that are currently queued with
qemu_co_queue_restart_all().

qemu_co_queue_wait() takes a lock as its second parameter. You don't
need it in this context and can just pass NULL. (This is a lock that
would be dropped while the coroutine is sleeping and automatically
reacquired afterwards.)

This works, too, but it requires an additional struct. I think the queue
is easier. (Note there is a difference in the mechanism: Your patch
waits for the specific update it triggered, while the CoQueue would wait
for _any_ update to complete. I assume effectively the result is the
same.)
