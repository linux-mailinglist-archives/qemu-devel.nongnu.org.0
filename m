Public bug reported:

Hello,

After setting up COLO's primary and secondary VMs,
I installed the vncserver and xrdp (apt install tightvncserver xrdp) inside=
 the VM.

I access the VM from another PC via VNC/RDP client, and everything is OK.
Then, kill the primary VM and issue the failover commands.

The expected result is that the VNC/RDP client can reconnect and resume
automatically after failover. (I've confirmed the VNC/RDP client can
reconnect automatically.)

But in my test, the VNC client's screen hangs and cannot be recovered no
longer. (I need to restart VNC client by myself.)

BTW, it works well after killing SVM.

Thanks.

Regards,
Derek
