You could say it lies because in FIFO mode it clearly isn=E2=80=99t a fil=
ter for
all of its children.

There is a reason for lying, though, which is
bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter(), which is necessary to use the whole
to_replace mirror stuff.

(You mirror from a quorum with a failed child and then replace the
failed child.  mirror needs to ensure that there are only R/W filters
between the child and the mirror source so that replacing it will not
suddenly change any visible data.  Which is actually a lie for quorum,
because the child is clearly broken and thus precisely doesn=E2=80=99t sh=
ow the
same data...)

Maybe we should stop declaring Quorum a filter and then rename the
bdrv_recurse_is_first_non_filter() to, I don=E2=80=99t know,
bdrv_recurse_can_be_replaced_by_mirror()?

Well, it doesn=E2=80=99t.  It isn=E2=80=99t an R/W filter.

Maybe what we actually need to rephrase is the definition of .is_filter.
 (Namely something along the lines of =E2=80=9CFulfills these guarantees =
(same
data, etc. pp.), *and* should be skipped for allocation information
queries etc.=E2=80=9D.

Not precisely because it=E2=80=99s useful, but because qcow2 does not hav=
e
=2Eis_filter set.  :-)
(And it doesn=E2=80=99t have it set because that wouldn=E2=80=99t be usef=
ul.)

That=E2=80=99s correct.  But that=E2=80=99s not a fundamental problem, of=
 course, we
could make it a per-BDS attribute if that made sense.

But just arguing that I=E2=80=99m incapable of giving a good definition w=

=2Eis_filter is for R/W filters.  COW filters have .supports_backing for =
that.

I think the problem appears because you restrict the process to a single
step where there=E2=80=99s actually two.

Drivers can be either
(1) R/W filters (e.g. throttle)
(2) COW filters (e.g. qcow2)
(3) None of the above (e.g. vhdx, curl)

This choice is made on the driver level, not on the node level (for good
reason, see below*).

And then we derive the node=E2=80=99s filtered children from what the dri=
ver is.
 If it=E2=80=99s an R/W filter, bdrv_filtered_child() will return the R/W=

filtered child.  If it=E2=80=99s a COW filter, bdrv_filtered_child() will=
 return
the potentially existing COW backing child (or NULL, if there is no
backing child).


*
What is clear to me is that it isn=E2=80=99t useful to treat nodes of a s=
pecific
driver sometimes as R/W filter nodes and sometimes not.  R/W filter
nodes are handled differently from other nodes, and it would be
confusing if a certain driver sometimes behaves this and sometimes that
way.  (For example, if you put a raw node on top of a qcow2 node,
sometimes it would stop the backing chain, sometimes it wouldn=E2=80=99t.=
  That
makes no sense to me.)

OTOH, for COW filters, we do exactly that.  Sometimes they have a
backing file, sometimes they don=E2=80=99t.  That=E2=80=99s completely fi=
ne because
their overall behavior doesn=E2=80=99t change.


That makes me agree that there is indeed too much of a difference
between R/W filters and COW filters to lump them together under the
=E2=80=9Cfilter=E2=80=9D label.

I=E2=80=99ll see how that looks overall, but why not.  Sounds good to me.=
