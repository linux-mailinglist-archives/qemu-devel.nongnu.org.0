Red Hat supports Docker on RHEL 7 and above.

Docker solved all my problems, as long as a host can install Docker, I
can build on old or edge images. I don't install plenty of dependencies
on my testing hosts, but in trashable docker images. For regular testing
I use image snapshots.

You need a sysadmin (or root access) to install the docker daemon however.
