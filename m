It's a well-defined order, but it doesn't actually help in a
lot of cases, because often the thing you care about ordering
on is not a device or is not in the same tree as the thing
it depends on. (For instance, there's an annoying ordering
issue between the rom-loader's "reset" function which copies rom
blob contents into RAM, and the Arm M-profile CPU reset method,
which needs to read the starting PC and SP out of RAM. [*])
It's also still an implicit ordering, in the sense that if
there's a dependency between device A (in subtree A') and device
B (in subtree B') then this will all work fine up until somebody
at the top level innocently reorders A' and B' in the list of
children of their mutual parent for some reason and then finds
they've broken an implicit dependency.

[*] aside: this one would actually be fixed by the multi-phase reset
proposal, since the definition of the reset phases is such that
the rom-loader should write to memory in phase 2 ('hold') and
the CPU should read from it in phase 3 ('exit').

Yes, absolutely. Also we should qdevify the non-qdev devices.
This part is something where we have a clear path forwards
for making cleanups (no tricky design decisions/debate required),
it just requires somebody to write the actual code.

If you get "CPU reset" and "built in bootloader sets the PC to the
initial address specified by the -kernel file" the wrong way around
then we break booting :-)

It's mostly just logically neater -- you could imagine a future
QEMU version that supported one simulation which had models
of more than one machine simultaneously, in which case there
ought to be two system buses, one per machine. And it's
logical that vl.c has to create the machine that the user
asked for, but it's a bit odder that it also has to create the
system bus specially extra, even though it's really just part
of the machine. But as I say, because Machine isn't a subtype of
Device you can't make buses be children of Machine anyway.
Fixing that is more effort than would be warranted for "it looks
slightly nicer this way around".
