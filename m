Hi,

Some protocol drivers do not really support file truncation but still
implement .bdrv_co_truncate(): They just don=E2=80=99t do anything when a=
sked to
shrink a file.  This is reflected by qemu-img, which warns if you resize
a file and it has the exact same length afterwards as it had before.

We can just do that generically.  There is no reason for some protocol
drivers to act ashamed and pretend nobody notices.  The only thing we
have to take care of is to zero everything in the first sector past the
desired EOF, so that format probing won=E2=80=99t go wrong.

(RFC: Is it really OK to just do this for all block drivers?)

Similarly, we can add a fallback file creation path: If a block driver
does not support creating a file but it already exists, we can just use
it.  All we have to do is truncate it to the desired size.


This is an RFC because it feels weird and I don=E2=80=99t want people to
associate me with weird stuff too closely.

Well, patch 1 isn=E2=80=99t really an RFC.  It=E2=80=99s just a fix.


I was inspired to this series by Maxim=E2=80=99s patch =E2=80=9Cblock/nvm=
e: add support
for image creation=E2=80=9D (from his =E2=80=9CFew fixes for userspace NV=
ME driver=E2=80=9D
series).
