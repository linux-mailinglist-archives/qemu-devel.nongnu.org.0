Looking through old bug tickets... can you still reproduce this issue
with the latest version of QEMU? Or could we close this ticket nowadays?

Title:
  vfio bug with all no VGA card

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hello,

  I whant to report to you a realy big bug.

  vfio passthrough work only with VGA card ! When i try to use vfio with
  any other PCI or PCI-E card it does not work.

  When i use vfio for VGA i can reboot (or shutdown and start again) my
  VM with out problem, but for any other PCI card the VM refuse to
  reboot.

  In dmesg i have this error :

  dmar: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
  dmar: DMAR:[DMA Read] Request device [xx:xx.x] fault addr 2affde000
  DMAR:[fault reason 06] PTE Read access is not set

  and some time the same but for Write and not Read.

  I found a kind of work around but it's ugly. Just detach your devices
  from vfio, re-atach to his normal driver and bind again to vfio.

  For information i use an Asrock Z87 Extrem 6 with a CoreI5 4570S
  My kernel is 3.12 and Qemu is 1.7-rc0
