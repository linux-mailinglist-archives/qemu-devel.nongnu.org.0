I think it is feasible to use QAPI to declare the QOM object type,
QOM parent type, list of QOM interfaces and QOM properties in a
declarative manner. From that generate all the tedious boilerplate
code. The dev then just has to provide the "interesting" code for
the object.

I'd really like to do a PoC of this but never have free time :-(
Perhaps an interesting task for someone who wants to delve into
some new work...

We certainly won't apply the suggested replacement as in many cases
it is not going to be a functionally equivalent drop-in.

If QEMU logs it to stderr, it will end up in the per-VM log file
libvirt has under /var/log/libvirt/qemu/$GUESTNAME.log.  If QEMU
doesn't log it to stderr, then libvirt would just write it to
that same log file itself.

If libvirt gains some API or event for notifying apps of deprecation
we might bubble it up to the mgmt app that way.

I still feel it is useful to have the suggested replacement in the
logs, rather  than only leaving it in qemu-deprecated.texi.  This
way the info is immediately visible to both app developers and any
support person dealing with bugs.

If the app dev see the suggested replacement upfront they're more
likely to make an immediate decision to update their code if the
suggestion is trivial. If they need to go find the QEMU docs to
lookup what action is required I feel they'll more likely just
put the item on their long todo list where it will languish.

Daniel
