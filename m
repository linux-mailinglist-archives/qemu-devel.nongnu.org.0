It doesn't look weird in the surface, but it doesn't change the
fact that "NewModel-orig" is the version of NewModel that was
shipped in in QEMU 4.2.  Why would we want to hide that fact?

What's the advantage of:

  "-machine pc-i440fx-4.1 -cpu NewModel" will use "NewModel-orig",
  which is the version of NewModel added in QEMU 4.2.

in relation to:

  "-machine pc-i440fx-4.1 -cpu NewModel" will use "NewModel-4.2",
  which is the version of NewModel added in QEMU 4.2.
