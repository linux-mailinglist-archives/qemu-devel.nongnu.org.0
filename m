FWIW, I've given this a spin, and it manages to boot my growing
collection of problematic images, along with all the previously-working
images I had lying around.

For both patches, feel free to take that as:

Having these in 4.1 would be nice. AIUI the logic is correct, and this
seems low risk to me, but it is your call.

If you decide to hold off for a release, I can apply these patches
locally without too much pain.

Thanks for dealing with this, anyhow!

Mark.
