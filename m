The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  windows's paint software cross-shadped cursor offset a pixel in guest
  windows which is generated by qemu-kvm

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  I have already tested lots of versions of QEMU. Since qemu-2.3.0 -- qemu-=
3.0.0. I find weird phenomena about windows's paint software cross-shaped c=
ursor offset a pixel since qemu-2.10.0, but it is ok before the version of =
qemu-2.10.0. Only spice agent and service are running in guest windows sinc=
e qemu-2.10.0, windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor offset a pixel =
is the same as the windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor focus point=
 is the same as the true windows machine instead of virtual windows machine.
  What does QEMU change since qemu-2.10.0? It is the changes that result in=
 windows's paint software cross-shaped cursor is not accurate with true win=
dows machine for comparison.  =

  The following is the full command line used to launch the QEMU guest:
  # /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -M pc -name win7-6904 -hda /=
home/win7_kvmgt.img -bios /usr/bin/bios.bin -enable-kvm -k en-us -vga qxl -=
display egl-headless -spice disable-ticketing,port=3D6904,streaming-video=
=3Dall -machine kernel_irqchip=3Don,usb=3Don -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s3=3D=
1 -global PIIX4_PM.disable_s4=3D1 -cpu host -device usb-tablet

  BTW, guest windows display card is QXL driver.
  But the following full command line used to launch the QEMU guest is OK. =
For comparison, I pasted it below (Just add vdagent and spicevmc in the com=
mand line to make sure spice service and agent is running in the guest wind=
ows):
  # /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -smp 2 -M pc -name win7-6904 -hda /=
home/win7_kvmgt.img -bios /usr/bin/bios.bin -enable-kvm -k en-us -vga qxl -=
