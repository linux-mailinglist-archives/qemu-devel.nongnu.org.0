I took a look and didn't find out why. I checked that in the ELF specification some
file headers can indicate a sign extension. E.g. R_X86_64_32S for example is described as
"Direct 32 bit zero extended". Note that the use of the tags are dependent on how the
ELF was built, so we would need the exact ELF to check for that. All I can say is that
there is a sign extension going on, in the 'lowaddr' field, and that translate_fn()
wasn't enough to filter it out. I can't say whether this is intended or a bug.


But going back a little, this whole situation happened in v5 because, in the next
patch, riscv_load_initrd() started to receive an uint64_t (kernel_entry) instead of
receiving a target_ulong like it was doing before. This behavior change, which was
accidental, not only revealed this sign-extension behavior but also potentially changed
what riscv_load_initrd() is receiving from load_uimage_as() the same way it's
impacting load_elf_ram_sym(). The third load option, load_image_targphys_as(), is
already using a target_ulong (kernel_start_addr) as return value so it's not
impacted.

I believe Alistair suggested to clear bits instead of just doing a target_ulong
cast for a reason (I guess we're trying to gate all 32/64 bit CPU logic using a
direct approach such as checking the CPU directly), but I also think we should
clear bits for all 'kernel_entry' possibilities, not just the one that comes from
load_elf_ram_sym(), to be consistent in all three cases. We might be even avoiding
a future headache from load_uimage_as().



Thoughts?
