Ah, well, right. I should have mentioned that... but we've hit that
problem in the past so often that my mind apparently sorted it into the
well-known category and did not came up with the idea that it would be
good to mention it ;-)

The problem is that libssh is very much broken in Bionic. Ubuntu
backported some patches into that version so that QEMU's configure
script thinks that it is a newer version, but they did not backport some
other important patches so that compilation later fails. Since it's
rather a bug in the distro and not in QEMU, we never "fixed" this issue,
so libssh can not be used in Bionic. See also:
