Wrong too, because I can:) for example, chaining two rules, catching the
positions of definition and check that they are different.. Or, some
cheating with python script.. That's why I wrote "not trivial",

So, most correct would be "(can't figure out how to simply match several de=
finitions regardless
 > of control flow)".

But again, coccinelle is for matching control flows, so its probably imposs=
ible to match such thing..

I'll check this thing soon. And resend today.

Yes, still interesting, can coccinelle do more smart inheritance to match
exactly same object... I think, I need to CC coccinelle mailing list
to the next version
