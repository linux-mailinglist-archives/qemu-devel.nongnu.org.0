I doubt this is as easy as it may seem at the first sight. To remind
everyone, the way internal snapshots with VM state work today is:

1. Write VM state to VM state area inside the image (in qcow2, this is
   essentially the same as disk content, except at offsets higher than
   the image size).

2. Create the qcow2 snapshot, which means that the current disk content
   (including the VM state at higher offsets) becomes COW and the
   snapshotted copy becomes read-ony.

3. Discard the VM state in the active layer again, we don't need it
   there.

The implication is that either 1. has to be completed before 2. can
happen, or that 2. must be able to write into an already taken snapshot
rather than to the active layer (which in turn implies that the snapshot
must have completed).

So a naive implementation with a transaction might not give the right
result. It's not just independent operations, but some ordering between
them is required.

I feel having a single block job that covers both parts gives us more
flexibility in how we want to synchronise writing the VM state and
taking the disk snapshot - or in your words, avoids boxing us into a
corner.
