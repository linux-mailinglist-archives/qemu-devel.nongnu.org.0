No, the very reason that we split this file off of blockdev.c is that 
transactions are NOT needed in qemu-img.  You have to have separate .o 
files for what qemu-img needs, vs. what the rest of qemu proper needs, 
and transactions are only needed in qemu proper at the moment.  If we 
ever need transactions in Kevin's qemu-storage-daemon but not all of 
blockdev.c, then we'd need yet another .c file independent from either 
blockdev.c or this patch's new bitmap-qmp-cmds.c.

Copy-and-paste from blockdev.c, tweaked by adding one word.  Your 
wording is also fine.

When splitting a file, the safest course of action is to preserve ALL 
copyright from the original file into the new file.

Adding additional copyright lines is okay as part of submitting new 
functionality, but in this case, I don't feel comfortable adding Red Hat 
copyright (my split isn't adding new functionality), and I don't have 
authorization to add Virtuozzo copyright (as that is not my employer).

Thanks. I blame rebase; an earlier version used a different header in 
patch 4/9; when I moved things to block_int.h in that patch, I didn't 
realize that this patch could be improved.
