Title:
  After upgrade qemu to 5.0.0-0.3.rc2.fc33 the virtual machine with
  Windows 10 after a while starts to work very slowly

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Description of problem:

  After upgrade qemu to 5.0.0-0.3.rc2.fc33 the virtual machine with
  Windows 10 after a while starts to work very slowly

  I created the virtual machine with Windows 10 with the following config:
  - 1 CPU
  - 2GB RAM
  - With network access

  I launch there a web browser there with flash content. =

  And usually, the system (Windows 10) does not work there for more than an=
 hour.
  When the system starts to work very slowly it doesn't respond to "Reboot"=
 and "Shut Down" commands. Only works "Force Reset" and "Force Off". But wh=
en I reboot the system with "Force Reset" it usually stuck at boot at the W=
indows splash screen. https://imgur.com/yGyacDG

  The last version of qemu which not contain this issue is
  5.0.0-0.2.rc0.fc33
