Before I answer the question, let me provide a bit of background.

The tests we're discussing exercise QMP command device-list-properties.
We're trying to catch two kinds of bugs:

* device introspection crashes or hangs outright, and

* device introspection has unwelcome side effects.

We're vulnerable to such bugs since device introspection has to create
and destroy an instance (consequence of QOM's design), and the device
code that gets run on creation and destruction can do anything.

To catch crashs or hangs, we execute one introspection, throwing away
its result.

Catching general side effects is impossible, so we instead catch special
side effects that (a) have a history of actual bugs, and (b) are easy to
observe: changes to the qdev tree visible in info qtree, and changes to
the QOM composition tree visible in info qom-tree.

Now I'm ready to answer the question.

test_device_intro_none() covers introspection of nonexistent device type
"nonexistent".  device-list-properties is expected to fail without
creating a device instance, let alone run device code.

test_device_intro_abstract() covers introspection of abstract device
type "abstract".  device-list-properties is again expected to fail
without creating a device instance.

The test neglects to cover "type exists, but is not a device" (my
fault).  Same thing.

In all these cases, side effects on "info qtree" and "info qom-tree" in
the (tiny amount of) generic code they run are theoretically possible,
but vanishingly unlikely.  If generic code ever gets confused enough to
somehow create an instance, all bets are off, of course.

Daniel's patch loses us some insurance against this kind of confusion.
Do we care?

I guess the insurance is nice to have when it costs basically nothing.
