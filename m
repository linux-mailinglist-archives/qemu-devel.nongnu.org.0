>=20

No, I've said that whenever possible we could use containers and thus
shared runners.  For instance, testing QEMU running on the x86 CentOS 8
KVM is not something we could do with shared runners.=20

>=20

Short answer is no.  The original scope and goal was to have the same or
very similar jobs that Peter runs himself in his own machines.  So it
was/is not about just x86 hardware, but x86 that can run a couple of
different OSs, and non-x86 hardware too.  We're basically scaling down
and changing the scope (for instance adding the s390 machine here) in
an attempt to get this moving forward.

>=20

Sure, this is actually an extrapolation/extension of what we're
proposing to do here with the unique "staging" branch.  I see no issues
at all to have more than one (one per subsystem/maintainer) staging
branches.

>=20

This is very much aligned to some previous discussions, I believe, at
the RFC thread.  But for practical purposes, the general direction was
to scale down to the bare minimum to replicate Peter's setup and
workflow, and then move from there to possibly something very similar
to what you're describing here.

Thanks a *whole lot* for the feedback Daniel!
