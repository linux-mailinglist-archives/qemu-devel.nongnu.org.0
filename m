The upcoming capstone 5.0 drops support for the old way
of including its header, due to this change:
https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/commit/6656bcb63ab4e87dc6079bd6b6b12cc8dd9b2ad8
The official way is to use <capstone/capstone.h>

This change has already been proposed before, see
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/20180215173539.11033-1-f4bug@amsat.org/
but it didn't find its way into qemu at that time.

On current systems, using <capstone/capstone.h> works
now (despite the pkg-config-supplied -I/usr/include/capstone) -
since on all systems capstone headers are put into capstone/
subdirectory of a system include dir. So this change is
compatible with both the obsolete way of including it
and the only future way.

I dunno how relevant this is for 7.2, it's probably too
late already to test it on everything, but at the same
time, once capstone-5 will be released, there will be many
user questions about how to build qemu. This has already
been asked in #qemu - gentoo already have capstone-5.0-rc
and qemu fails to build with that one, but works fine
with this change.
