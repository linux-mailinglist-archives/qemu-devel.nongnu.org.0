hi Alex
after porting gvt/i40e vf migration code to kernel/qemu v23, we spoted
two bugs.
1. "Failed to get dirty bitmap for iova: 0xfe011000 size: 0x3fb0 err: 22"
   This is a qemu bug that the dirty bitmap query range is not the same
   as the dma map range. It can be fixed in qemu. and I just have a little
   concern for kernel to have this restriction.

2. migration abortion, reporting
"qemu-system-x86_64-lm: vfio_load_state: Error allocating buffer
qemu-system-x86_64-lm: error while loading state section id 49(vfio)
qemu-system-x86_64-lm: load of migration failed: Cannot allocate memory"

It's still a qemu bug and we can fixed it by
"
if (migration->pending_bytes == 0) {
+            qemu_put_be64(f, 0);
+            qemu_put_be64(f, VFIO_MIG_FLAG_END_OF_STATE);
"
and actually there are some extra concerns about this part, as reported in
[1][2].

[1] data_size should be read ahead of data_offset
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg02795.html.
[2] should not repeatedly update pending_bytes in vfio_save_iterate()
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg02796.html.

but as those errors are all in qemu, and we have finished basic tests in
both gvt & i40e, we're fine with the kernel part interface in general now.
(except for my concern [1], which needs to update kernel patch 1)

so I wonder which way in your mind is better, to give our reviewed-by to
the kernel part now, or hold until next qemu fixes?
and as performance data from gvt is requested from your previous mail, is
that still required before the code is accepted?

BTW, we have also conducted some basic tests when viommu is on, and found out
errors like 
"qemu-system-x86_64-dt: vtd_iova_to_slpte: detected slpte permission error (iova=0x0, level=0x3, slpte=0x0, write=1)
qemu-system-x86_64-dt: vtd_iommu_translate: detected translation failure (dev=00:03:00, iova=0x0)
qemu-system-x86_64-dt: New fault is not recorded due to compression of faults".

Thanks
Yan
