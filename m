Valid point.  Still, I believe we should at least try to predict how the
pieces we create now would fit with the pieces we plan to create later
on.

Note that full QAPIfication of -machine isn't necessary to make QAPI
feature "deprecated" work for machine types.  Turning MachineInfo member
@name into an enum, so we can tack "deprecated" onto its values, would
suffice.

Such a QAPIfication of machine types is still hard: QOM types are
defined at compile time just like the QAPI schema, but their definition
is distributed, and collected into one place only at run time.  I
discussed this on slide 39 of my "QEMU interface introspection: From
hacks to solutions" talk (KVM Form 2015).  Just for device_add, but it's
just a special case of QOM.  Choices listed there:

* Collect drivers at compile time? Hard...
* Make QAPI schema dynamic? Hard...
* Forgo driver-specific arguments in schema?
  Defeats introspection...

I'd like to add to the last item:

  Provide QOM introspection on par with QAPI schema introspection

The QOM introspection we have (qom-list-types etc. is not on par.

Back to exposing machine type deprecation.

I'm doubtful your proposed solution can be applied widely.  It relies on
adding @support-status to something that provides information on
whatever is deprecated.  The initial use is with a something that is an
ad hoc query, namely query-machines.  To use it, the management
application needs to understand what query-machines' @support-status
applies to.  Certainly feasible.  But I fear every use will be a special
case.  Furthermore, a suitable ad hoc query need not exist.  What then?
Create suitable ad hoc queries just for communicating deprecation?

Instead, I'd like us to think about a more genral solution.  Or perhaps
two: one for properly QAPIfied stuff, and one for QOM.

I agree we should point to a preferred replacement whenever we deprecate
something.

We have to do it in documentation.  And we generally do, in
qemu-deprecated.texi.

How useful would doing it in QMP as well be?  Depends on what management
applications can do with the additional information.

I'm confident we can come up with *something*.  It might kill the neat
and simple "use QAPI features to communicate deprecation" idea, though.
