Shipping them as pre-built binaries in QEMU is not a viable option
IMHO, especially for grub as a GPL'd project we need to be extremely
clear about the exact corresponding source and build process for any
binary.

For this kind of thing I would generally expect the distro to provide
packages that we consume. Looking at biosbits I see it is itself
bundling a bunch more 3rd party projects, libffi, grub2, and including
even an ancient version of python as a submodule.

So bundling a pre-built biosbits in QEMU appears to mean that we're in
turn going to unexpectedly bundle a bunch of other 3rd party projects
too, all with dubious license compliance. I don't think this looks like
something we should have in qemu.git or qemu tarballs. It will also
make it challenging for the distro to take biosbits at all, unless
those 3rd party bundles can be eliminated in favour of using existing
builds their have packaged for grub, python, libffi, etc.

With regards,
Daniel
