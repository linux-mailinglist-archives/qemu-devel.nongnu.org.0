You right, 
I even had an alternative impl. earlier that used string property
instead of link, but later I forgot about this complication
and simplified it to link property which works fine but only
for -m case.

It's necessary to rewrite patches 2-4/80 to use string property
for memory-backend which will be used for delayed backend access
at machine_run_board_init() time.

I'll CC you on relevant patches for reviewing when I post v4.
