Why introduce it now and not only when someone would like to add legacy 
mode? I guess nobody needs legacy mode so we can avoid complexity 
modelling that unused detail now and only add it when needed.

Then qdev is probably overly complex for simple things.

I still think what you propose is more complex than my patch and does not 
achieve any cleaner model. If you object to using isa_get_irq here I can 
go the piix way and embed the PIC array as well (or set a pointer to that 
with a property somehow) so I can use isa_irq[n] rather than adding 
non-existing pins for this. I won't do anything though until IDE and QEMU 
maintainers indicate what their preference is.

I think you did not like emulating the interrupt selection in via-ide that 
decides which irq to raise (which is really just one if() ) and would like 
to push it out to board code instead connecting it via gpios. But that's 
also not quite correct and would not even get rid of the feature bit you 
also disliked. In fact we don't actually have a qdev model for the 
VT82C686B where all this probably belongs but I don't plan to make a 
detailed qdevified model for that now (could be done later in a clean up 
patch maybe when I'll clean up pegasos2 patches for inclusion) and since 
via-ide is considered part of that southbridge (and reused in similar 
VT8231 model) we can include the interrupt controller emulation (this one 
if() ) as well for now and not worry about PCI specs that don't really 
apply to a "chip" that's not a standalone PCI IDE controller but part of a 
bigger southbridge chip. It's just reuses PCI IDE emulation from QEMU 
where appropriate.

The datasheet (of the IDE function) says that PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE selects 
the ISA interrupt that's raised in native mode for both channels and 
guests work if we emulate that. Since via-ide is part of the southbridge 
that also includes the PICs they are somehow connected inside and 
something selects the interrupt line within the chip but I don't know how 
exactly that's implemented in hardware. If not the ide part directly as 
you propose then some other interrupt controller part has to do this and 
we need to do the same somewhere in our model. Since we don't emulate the 
southbridge in more detail I've just put it in via-ide which seems to be a 
good place as it's only used in these southbridges and this could be 
changed later if via-ide were used elsewhere. No need to be more complex 
now than that I think.

It's not incorrect. It follows what the datasheet says at least for 
VT8231, the 686B does not detail this but the Linux driver also works on 
fulong2e with this so I think it's correct for that as well.

I don't get this. My patch emulates that already, what do you want to be 
changed here?

Why do you think so? You base this on PCI docs but those don't necessarily 
apply to via-ide which is not a standalone PCI device but embedded in 
integrated southbridges whose datasheets say what I've implemented and 
guests are happy with that. So I don't think it's incorrect maybe just not 
to your taste.

Then please do that and submit alternative patches. I don't understand all 
of your proposals so it's easier if you can do it in less than an hour. It 
would probably take me more time. I'll test them with the clients if you 
provide patches or I've pushed my working version now to

https://osdn.net/projects/qmiga/scm/git/qemu/tree/pegasos2/

so you can try as well.

I also think we're not getting anywhere so I hope John and Peter can give 
some advice here what is needed to get these patches merged. I've run out 
of time for now so I won't have time to make extensive changes to these 
patches and can only make reasonable changes or test what you provide.

You seem to want to force me again to qdevify everything now which I don't 
have time for. You did the same to my OpenBIOS patches too where you 
wanted me to clean up PCI code and implement handling of multiple PCI 
buses when I just wanted to include a simple workaround to get MorphOS 
running until the bigger clean up is eventually done. Even though some 
years have passed you did still not come around to do the OpenBIOS PCI 
clean up but also not accepted my workaround in the meantime so I need to 
use patched OpenBIOS for MorphOS ever since. I think we'd end up in the 
same situation with these patches. (It would be OK if OpenBIOS were 
otherwise very clean but it's full of other workarounds like patching 
device tree and installing QEMU VGA driver to any VGA card it sees and 
others that are much worse than what I've proposed and you don't seem to 
mind those which come from you just those that someone else propose.) 
Don't get this wrong, we don't have any personal problem with each other, 
at least I don't have anything against you but your habit of forcing 
people to do much more additional work just to satisfy your pedantry is 
not something I have time to comply with. If you propose changes that make 
the patches simpler or in some way better I'd do that but otherwise I'll 
only do what QEMU maintainers also think is necessary.
