Title:
  ARM: singlestepping insn which UNDEFs should stop at UNDEF vector
  insn, not after it

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  ARMv7a has lot of undefined instruction from its instruction opcode
  space. This undefined instructions are very useful for replacing
  sensitive non-priviledged instructions of guest operating systems
  (virtualization). The undefined instruction exception executes at
  <exception_base> + 0x4, where <exception_base> can be 0x0 or
  0xfff00000. Currently, in qemu 0.14.0 undefined instruction fault at
  0x8 offset instead of 0x4. This was not a problem with qemu 0.13.0,
  seems like this is a new bug. As as example, if we try to execute
  value "0xec019800" in qemu 0.14.0 then it should cause undefined
  exception at <exception_base>+0x4 since "0xec019800" is an undefined
  instruction.
