This is a tangent, but I was a bit too harsh in my previous message (at
least it made you laugh rather than angry!) so I think I owe you an
explanation.

Given there are hardware implementation of virtio, I would refine that:
virtio is a silver bullet whenever we want a mature ring buffer
interface across architectures.  Being friendly to virtualization is by
now only a detail of virtio.  It is also not exclusive to virtio, for
example NVMe 1.3 has incorporated some ideas from Xen and virtio and is
also virtualization-friendly.

In turn, the ring buffer interface is great if you want to have mostly
asynchronous operation---if not, the ring buffer is just adding
complexity.  Sure, we have the luxury of abstractions and powerful
computers that hide most of the complexity, but some of it still lurks
in the form of race conditions.

So the question for virtio-mem is what makes asynchronous operation
important for memory hotplug?  If I understand the virtio-mem driver,
all interaction with the virtio device happens through a work item,
meaning that it is strictly synchronous.  At this point, you do not need
a ring buffer, you only need:

- a command register where you write the address of a command buffer.
The device will do DMA from the command block, do whatever it has to do,
DMA back the results, and trigger an interrupt.

- an interrupt mechanism.  It could be MSI, or it could be an interrupt
pending/interrupt acknowledge register if all the hardware offers is
level-triggered interrupts.

I do agree that virtio-mem's command buffer/DMA architecture is better
than the more traditional "bunch of hardware registers" architecture
that QEMU uses for its ACPI-based CPU and memory hotplug controllers.
But that's because command buffer/DMA is what actually defines a good
paravirtualized interface; virtio is a superset of that that may not be
always a good solution.
