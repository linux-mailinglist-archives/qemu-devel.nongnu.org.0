I've seen something similar on s390x with virtio-ccw-blk under
protected virtualization, that made me wonder about how virtio-blk in
particular but also virtio in general handles shutdown and reset.

This makes me wonder if bus-mastering disabled is the only scenario when
a something like vdev->disabled should be used.

In particular I have the following mechanism in mind 

qemu_system_reset() --> ... --> qemu_devices_reset() --> ... --> 
--> virtio_[transport]_reset() --> ... --> virtio_bus_stop_ioeventfd()
--> virtio_blk_data_plane_stop()

which in turn triggesrs the following cascade:
virtio_blk_data_plane_stop_bh --> virtio_queue_aio_set_host_notifier_handler() -->
--> virtio_queue_host_notifier_aio_read() 
which however calls 
virtio_queue_notify_aio_vq() if the notifier tests as
positive. 

Since we still have vq->handle_aio_output that means we may
call virtqueue_pop() during the reset procedure.

This was a problem for us, because (due to a bug) the shared pages that
constitute the virtio ring weren't shared any more. And thus we got
the infamous  
virtio_error(vdev, "virtio: zero sized buffers are not allowed").

Now the bug is no more, and we can tolerate that somewhat late access
to the virtio ring.

But it keeps nagging me, is it really OK for the device to access the
virtio ring during reset? My intuition tells me that the device should
not look for new requests after it has been told to reset.

Opinions? (Michael, Connie)
