Few months ago Klaus sent a bomb series with ~80 patches, we asked
him to split in digestible series of ~20 patches.

Earlier in this cover Klaus provided a link to his git repository
with all the patches sorted [2]:
https://github.com/birkelund/qemu/tree/for-master/nvme

This seems enough to get the big picture.

Niklas Cassel, it would be helpful if you or Dmitry can review
Klaus patches. I see Klaus is already reviewing Dmitry ones.

Both Keith and Kevin are quite busy recently.

To help them I suggest once you reviewed your patches each other,
one of you could send the big series with all patches together.

Anyway soft-freeze is next week, so you have to decide what is
critical.

What I see doable for the following days is:
- hw/block/nvme: Fix I/O BAR structure [3]
- hw/block/nvme: handle transient dma errors
- hw/block/nvme: bump to v1.3
