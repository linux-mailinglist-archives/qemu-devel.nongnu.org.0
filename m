It may be we need to work around some incomplete modelling of devices in 
QEMU, e.g. we only model the native mode of these IDE interfaces so 
anything involving legacy mode is out of scope. To also emulate legacy 
mode we'd need changing common ISA code and maybe PIC code as well. As 
those parts are also used by other more commonly used machine models I'd 
avoid breaking those and rather implement it confined to these machines 
that are not yet finished or complete anyway than try to change all 
dependent devices that would need even more testing. These "hacks" could 
be cleaned up later and this would not be the only hack in QEMU, I don't 
have time to fix everything and it's unreasonable to demand it I think. 
I'd suggest to take this patch as it is now and if you don't like it you 
can submit patches that clean it up the way you think is correct or submit 
an alternative patch now that shows how do you think it can be done in a 
cleaner way because I don't see it and don't have more time for it now.

I think that would involve changing parts which could break other machines 
so I'd rather go with a featute bit only affecting pegasos2 and fulonge2 
than touch i8259 or ISA emulation basing that on some guess how the real 
chip may be implemented. Is it possible to implement what you propose 
without changing common IDE, ISA and PIC emulation only in via-ide and 
fulong2e code?

Yes, this is a Linux term and Linux also uses a feature bit to enable this 
workaround. If that's good enough for Linux why isn't it good enough for 
you?

You're misunderstanding the comment. The via_ide_config_read function is 
needed to restore value in interrupt line that common PCI reset code 
deletes. Linux depends on this value to be the same as on real hardware so 
this is needed to work around QEMU and Linux pecularities.

I've tried using PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN in place of the feature bit but setting 
that to 0 breaks Linux and MorphOS on pegasos2 because these apparently 
expect this to be set to 1 corresponding to native mode. (Firmware only 
sets native mode enable bits in prog-if but datasheet says this reg should 
be 1 by default and other PCI docs say 0 here means no interrupt used so 
maybe that's why Linux and MorphOS don't like it.)

Please go ahead and do it but if you don't submit an alternative patch 
before the freeze I'd ask John and Peter to make a judgement here and tell 
if my series is acceptable or not in its current form and if it is then 
please merge it and leave clean ups for subsequent patches. This is 
blocking my further patches to implement pegasos2 emulation.
