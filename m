Thanks for the explanation, but I'm not sure what to do with this patch now.
Should I amend the commit msg to reflect what you explained, mentioning that
we're missing a handful of places where the FDT is updated? We can then come
back at a later time and update ms->fdt in those places as well. This would
be a good follow-up to do after we get rid of spapr->fdt_blob and use ms->fdt
only.

Another alternative is to drop this patch and do spapr in separate later on.
I can live with that, but I'd rather have something for spapr even under the
disclaimer that "this might be not the most up to date FDT the guest is
using".


Thanks,


Daniel
