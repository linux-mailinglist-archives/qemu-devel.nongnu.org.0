Well, depends what you mean by "glue".  What I have in mind is that
setting the host-trust-limitation machine property will change the
defaults for cpu features in include the necessary feature for s390,
just as the draft code already changes the defaults for the relevant
virtio properties.  My intention is that if you explicitly put feature
properties on the cpu, that will override those defaults.

Is that acceptable?  I'm aware that this property affecting things in
distant devices is kinda weird and ugly, but I don't see how else we
can make configuring this not horribly complicated and differently so
for each platform.
