Is this standby= option only valid for Network/Ethernet class code
devices?  If so, perhaps vfio-pci code should reject the option on any
non-ethernet devices.  The option is also non-intuitive for users, only
through examples like above can we see it relates to the id of the
secondary device.  Could we instead name it something like
"standby_net_failover_pair_id="?

Also, this feature requires matching MAC addresses per the description,
where is that done?  Is it the user's responsibility to set the MAC on
the host device prior to the device_add?  If so, is this actually not
only specific to ethernet devices, but ethernet VFs?

Finally, please copy me on code touching vfio.  Thanks,

Alex
