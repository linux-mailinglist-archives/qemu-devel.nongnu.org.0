Hmm.  The idea of reconnect-delay in qemu is that if the connection to 
the server is dropped, we try to reconnect and then retry the I/O 
operation.  Maybe what we want is an nbdkit filter which turns EIO 
errors from the v2v plugin into forced server connection drops, but 
leave nbdkit up and running to allow the next client to connect.  That's 
different from the existing --filter=retry behavior (where we try to 
keep the client connection alive and reopen the plugin), but has a 
similar effect (because we force the connection to the client to drop, 
the client would have to reconnect to get more data, and reconnecting 
triggers a retry on connecting to the plugin).  And it's different from 
--filter=exitlast (that says to quit nbdkit altogether, rather than just 
the current connection with a client).

Then this patch is no longer 5.0 material.  We may still want to improve 
shutdown handling in qemu (both in the client and in the server), but 
doing it correctly will be bigger than just one patch, based on 
Vladimir's response.
