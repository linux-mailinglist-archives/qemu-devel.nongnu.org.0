Is dlclose() really that important ? libnbd is such a small
thing that i doubt anyone will even notice the space being
consumed if you mark it nodelete, and if an app is repeatedly
doing an op that triggers dlopen+dlclose many times, then
dlclose is especially useless.

Personally I think removing memory leaks on thread exit is
more important than honouring dlclose, as some apps can do
pathelogical things creating *many* very short lived
threads.
