Was this test 147?  If so, see:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-02/msg01469.html

because that failure matches what I was seeing.

That's a secondary failure, I assume if the initial bug is fixed we are=20
less likely to hit the secondary one; but the secondary one may still be=20
worth fixing.

In libnbd, we recently improved the testsuite by switching over to=20
systemd-style fd passing: instead of asking qemu-nbd to open a random=20
port (and hoping it is available), we instead pre-open the port (where=20
failure is under our control) and then pass in that fd with environment=20
variables to qemu-nbd, which in turn guarantees that qemu-nbd won't hit=20
failures in trying to use the port.  Maybe we should utilize that more=20
in qemu's own testsuite.

Also, I need to revisit my proposed patches for letting qemu-nbd support=20
TLS over Unix sockets, as that's another way to avoid TCP contention=20
(right now, qemu has an anachronistic prohibition against the=20
combination of TLS and Unix sockets).

Ah, so we did notice the same problem.

Except then it will fail on machines configured for IPv6-only.
