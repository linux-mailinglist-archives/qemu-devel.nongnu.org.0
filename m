The problem is whether userspace can just sync GPA1 instead of both GPA1=20
and GPA2. If userspace can sync through GPA1 only, the dirty pages was=20
lost. Paolo has pointed out that userspace can not have that assumption.

It's not about reality, it's about possibility. Again, we don't want to=20
leave any corner case that is hard to debug or fix in the future.
