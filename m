To support live migration, we need the set of features seen by
the guest be determined only by the input given to QEMU, not host
capabilities.  It can be via:
(1) explicit "-cpu ...,+feat,feat=..." flags;
(2) through data in the CPU model table; or
(3) by hardcoding the same value for all configurations.

The current solution is (3).  (2) is probably the best solution,
with the assumption that the host can always emulate features
from an older CPU in a newer CPU.  If there are features that
can't be emulated if migrating to a newer CPU, a more explicit
configuration mechanism (1) might be better, because not being
able to migrate a VM to newer hardware is inconvenient.

None of those approaches prevent us from implementing passthrough
mode for "-cpu host".  Wouldn't that be preferred instead of
removing support for live migration?
