This seems a lot of flags; users aren't going to know what to do with
all of them; I don't see what will set/control them.

That's what I meant; stick to the old machine-type unless you know it's
safe to use a newer one.

> I don=E2=80=99 think it=E2=80=99s the right approach though. As there i=

I don't have an easy answer.  The users already have to make sure they
use a machine type that's old enough for all the QEMUs installed in
their cluster; making sure it's also old enough for their oldest
kernel isn't too big a difference - *except* that it's much harder to
tell which kernel corresponds to which feature/machine type etc - so
how does a user know what the newest supported machine type is?
Failing at startup when selecting a machine type that the current
kernel can't support would help that.
