Absolutely. I was mostly focused on fixing all the cases first.
I usually refactor such ugly code at the end, but this time I forgot
to do so.

Plus I need to pick a place where to put such function (it can be useful =
in any place in qemu),=20
and first check if maybe glib already has such free+scrub function implem=
ented somewhere.
