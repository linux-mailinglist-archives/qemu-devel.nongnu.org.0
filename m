This is true, but even without the repeated keys (e.g. in a syntax that
would use brackets), it would still be unnecessarily verbose and
probably hard to remember:

    id=3Dbar,backend=3D{type=3Dfile,data=3D{out=3D/tmp/bar.log}}

Well, first of all: Do we need compatibility? If we don't, then we can
just make the change.

Much of this threads plays with the though that maybe we don't need any
compatibility and make the radical conclusion that we don't need any
human-friendly interface at all. Keeping full compatibility is the other
extreme.

There might be some middle ground where we break compatibility where the
old way can't easily be maintained with the new infrastructure, but
don't give up on the idea of being used by humans.
