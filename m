Very useful, thanks.

Yes, but often you can leverage something (e.g. JSON, XML, etc)

We could decide that the new QAPI language is a custom implementation
of Python ;-) Or more seriously, we could have some part of the JSON
schema that are =E2=80=9Cescapes=E2=80=9D to C code that we put in some gen=
erated file.
I used {{ }} below for this escape, in which case the semantics would be
that of C plus some specific macros we insert in it.

{ 'option': '--add-fd',
 'data': { 'fd': 'int', 'set': 'int', '*opaque': 'str' },
 'help': [
"-add-fd fd=3Dfd,set=3Dset[,opaque=3Dopaque]",
"                Add 'fd' to fd 'set'=E2=80=9D]=20
 =E2=80=98validate=E2=80=99 : {{
    error_if(QOPT.fd < 0, =E2=80=9Cfd option cannot be negative=E2=80=9D);
    error_if(QOPT.fd <=3D STDERR_FILENO, =E2=80=9Cfd cannot be a standard I=
/O stream=E2=80=9D);
 }},
 =E2=80=98exec=E2=80=99 : {{
    if (do_add_fd(QOPT.fd, QOPT.fset, QOPT.opaque) < 0) {
        exit(1);
    }
 }},

I=E2=80=99m not necessarily saying this is a good idea, mind you.

I meant what you pointed out wrt. options, that this =E2=80=9Clanguage=E2=

know about the qemu configuration. There is =E2=80=98if=E2=80=99 today, you=

another =E2=80=9Clanguage=E2=80=9D with its own semantics=E2=80=A6 which JS=

nothing about.

Agreed too. The meta-schema would need to be extended.

Well, =E2=80=9Ckeeping things simple=E2=80=9D is a complicated thing.

If we do it, yes. If we delegate to an existing language (I showed C above)=
,
maybe it adds clarity without too much of an additional cost.

Hmmm, I guess I have not understood what you meant by
"QOM could not be covered easily by QAPI" then.

We don=E2=80=99t want the QAPI to let arbitrary fields of a QOM object
be modified, do we?

As for the =E2=80=9Cpublic=E2=80=9D aspects of a QOM object, that is static=
 if it
comes from QAPI, so why couldn=E2=80=99t we define it there?

I really don=E2=80=99t understand that point. To me, all these operations
seem relatively simple to generate.

I think that what confuses me is when you write =E2=80=9Csomething that has=
 a
dynamic structure=E2=80=9D. I understand that as referring to the structure
defined in the schema. But the schema itself is static. So you can
generate static code from it, and it=E2=80=99s already done today.

Another hypothesis on my side is that we don=E2=80=99t want, ever, to
have the API provide for example the option to create its own
arbitrary QOM classes, or to tag arbitrary properties to an object,
where by =E2=80=9Carbitrary=E2=80=9D I mean not explicitly mentioned somewh=
ere in
something like the schema.

So I suspect you are talking about something else.

But back to the original discussion about management tools,
do we let upper layers tag their own arbitrary stuff in QOM objects?

I=E2=80=99m sure you are right, but it=E2=80=99s hard for me to evaluate, g=
iven how
many ways there are to access an object. Naively, grepping for
set_prop and for new_with_prop does not give me that many hits.

You know that I positively hate this ;-)

Well, I guess we can expand the schema. #ILoveJSON.
