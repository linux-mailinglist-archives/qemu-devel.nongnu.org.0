What if we modify backing_bs() as something like this
(to work around braking a backing chain):

static BlockDriverState *child_file_bs(BlockDriverState *bs)
{
     return bs->file ? bs->file->bs : NULL;
}

static BlockDriverState *skip_filter(BlockDriverState *bs)
{
     BlockDriverState *ret_bs =3D bs;

     while (ret_bs && ret_bs->drv && ret_bs->drv->is_filter) {
         ret_bs =3D child_file_bs(ret_bs);
     }

     return ret_bs;
}

static BlockDriverState *backing_bs(BlockDriverState *bs)
{
     BlockDriverState *ret_bs =3D skip_filter(bs);

     if (!ret_bs) {
         return NULL;
     }

     return ret_bs->backing ? ret_bs->backing->bs : NULL;
}

--=20
