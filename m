Why would old guests assume that?

At least in v4.1 the kernel will calculate the max address by using
increment size * increment number and then test if *each* increment is
available with tprot.

I'm confused. The kernel currently only uses diag260(0x10). How is
diag260(0xc) relevant here?

That doesn't make sense to me: either support memory hotplug via
sclp/standby memory, or with your new method. But trying to support
both.. what's the use case?
