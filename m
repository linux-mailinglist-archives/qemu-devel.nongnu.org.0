Yes, but part of the problem is that what does get run as part of make
check currently does not help much.

So this doesn=E2=80=99t really defend the iotests from problems.

Deciding the subset is difficult.  My stance was that it=E2=80=99s better=
 to not
choose an arbitrary subset here but ensure that really everything gets
run as part of CI, that is asynchronously so it doesn=E2=80=99t block any=
one and
can take as long as it wants.

If we decide to get pull requests based on that, then that=E2=80=99d brin=
g even
more pain, but at least it=E2=80=99d be honest.  But just running half of=
 the
qcow2 tests to me seems only like we want to pretend we ran the iotests.
 So for me, iotests still break, and we need to deal with make check
failures on top.  I=E2=80=99d at least prefer one or the other.


I voted for dropping make check, because running all iotests doesn=E2=80=99=
t
seem feasible to me.

Hm, but make check also serves other purposes.  I would suppose e.g.
distributions generally require make check to pass when building packages=
=2E

I assumed our CI included more things than just make check, so we could
move the iotests from out of make check but keep them as part of CI.
