Out of curiosity, how does this compare to existing Arduino simulators?

How likely is it that these dependencies will be merged by May 18th
(start of the coding period)?  If they are not merged then the intern
will not be able to get their own patches into qemu.git.

This (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) Java program?  Please add
links to relevant code bases, hardware specs, file formats, etc so that
someone considering the project idea can research it.

I also see Python mentioned in this project idea.  Does the intern need
to be fluent in C, Python, and Java?  Please include skill/language
requirements in the text.

The tasks above could already take 12 weeks.  Especially the new QMP
commands and the UI code could be non-trivial.

I think newcomers will have a hard time designing QMP commands.  It
would help to provide the QMP command documentation so the intern
doesn't need to make design decisions in a space they are unfamiliar
with.

When Steffen G=F6rtz experimented with similar things using the micro:bit
emulation I remember emulation timing issues were a little tricky.
Emitting LED/PWM output and displaying it without timing glitches is
non-trivial since QEMU is not very precise and guest software might be
bit banging.

The scope of the project seems large for 12 weeks.  It could scare off
applicants or be unrealistic for an intern without lots of experience.
You could remove some tasks from the project idea and if the intern is
really quick then you can always give them additional tasks later.

"Arduino IDE" and "QEMU" are clear.  Is the "Arduino board" component
the Python UI application?
