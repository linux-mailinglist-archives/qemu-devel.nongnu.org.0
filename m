Where did you see that? What I got from trying to look this up in the 
schematics was that VT8231 has two pins named IRQ14 and IRQ15 (but 
described as Primary and Secondary Channel Interrupt Request in doc) where 
the interrupt lines of the two IDE ports/channels are connected but how 
they are routed within the chip after that was not clear. The chip doc 
says that in native mode the interrupt should be configurable and use a 
single interrupt for both channels and in legacy mode they use the usual 
14 and 15 but this is not what guest drivers expect so I think not how 
really works on PegasosII. It is true however that connection to PCI 
interrupts aren't mentioned so it always uses ISA IRQ numbers, it just 
depends on legacy vs. native mode which line is raised. But that was never 
really a question for VT8231 and maybe only CMD646 could have such 
interconnection with PCI interrupts. (Proabable reason is that via-ide is 
part of a southbridge chip where it has connections to ISA bus while 
CMD646 is a PCI IDE controller but I could be wrong as my knowledge is 
limited about these.)

I'm not sure that it makes much sense that the firmware configures the 
chip one way then puts info about a different way in the device tree. 
There could be bugs but this is not likely. Especially because I see in 
traces that the firmware does try to configure the device in native mode. 
These are the first few accesses of the firmware to via-ide:

pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x9 <- 0xf
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x40 <- 0xb
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x41 <- 0xf2
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x43 <- 0x35
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x44 <- 0x18
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x45 <- 0x1c
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x46 <- 0xc0
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x50 <- 0x17171717
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x54 <- 0x14
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x0 -> 0x5711106
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x0 -> 0x5711106
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x8 -> 0x1018f06
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0xc -> 0x0
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x2c -> 0x11001af4
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x3c -> 0x10e
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x4 -> 0x2800080
pci_cfg_read via-ide 12:1 @0x3c -> 0x10e
pci_cfg_write via-ide 12:1 @0x3c <- 0x109

The very first write is to turn on native mode, so I think it's not about 
what the firmware does but something about how hardware is wired on 
Pegasos II or the VT8231 chip itself that only allows legacy interrupts 
instead of 100% native mode for IDE.

Linux does try to handle both true native mode and half-native mode. It 
only uses half-native mode if finds IRQ14 on Pegasos, otherwise skips 
Pegasos specific fixup and uses true native mode setup. I don't know what 
MorphOS does but I think it justs knows that Pegasos2 has this quirk and 
does not look at the device tree at all.

I don't have direct access to real hardware and would also need to come up 
with some Forth to verify that but given the above trace that the firmware 
does before we can enter any Forth we would likely find @0x9 = 0x8f and 
@0x3c = 0x0e because after booting Linux we see 0x8a and 0x0e and Linux 
only touches the two mode bits.

So I don't know the ultimate reason why it works that way but I'm quite 
sure that this emulation is close enough and guests are happy with it too.
