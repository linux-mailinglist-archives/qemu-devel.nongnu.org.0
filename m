But it is not a filter.  If you limit the data by using an offset, that
precisely makes it not a filter.

I don=92t get what you mean because raw is not a filter.

If it were a filter, it=92d be clear: Regarding allocation information, w=
e
skip it.  But it isn=92t.  Hence we cannot skip it.

I don=92t see why you=92re trying to make the point with raw, when it sim=

is not a filter.

This sounds like it=92d be difficult to special-case filter nodes.  It is=
n=92t.

Whenever the user specifies some node that should refer to a backing
chain element, all you do is call bdrv_skip_rw_filters() and you land at
the corresponding COW node.

I simply do not see your point.

For two reasons:

(1) I don=92t think anyone should use is_allocate on nodes that are not
COW nodes.  They are likely to be doing something wrong then.

You don=92t seem to agree, because you say this makes the callers
complicated.  What I think is that we don=92t have that many callers, and=

it=92s probably a good thing when they have to think about the backing
chain structure.

But anyway.

(2) What I understand is that you propose adding some way to find out
the next element in the COW chain if is_allocated returns false.  Well,
my =93Deal with filters=94 series adds two ways to do that:

- bdrv_filtered_cow_bs(bdrv_skip_rw_filters(bs)) will return the first
child behind the COW node, but that may be another filter.

- bdrv_backing_chain_next(bs) will return =93the first non-filter backing=

image of the first non-filter image.=94.  It=92s just
bdrv_skip_rw_filters(bdrv_filtered_cow_bs(bdrv_skip_rw_filters(bs))).

So the thing is, we don=92t need to modify block_status to return that
information.  If is_allocated returns that something is not allocated,
the caller can just call one of these and thus get the next node where
to look.

When it comes to bdrv_is_allocated_above(), my series fixes that anyway,
no?  (In the sense that it does not choke on filters.)


So I cannot see how it does not come down to the callers.
