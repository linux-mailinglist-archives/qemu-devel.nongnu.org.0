There are two fw_cfg paths

  - etc/edk2/https/ciphers
  - etc/edk2/https/cacerts

The first sets the cipher algorithms that are permitted and their
priority, the second sets the CA certificate bundle.

There's some recently merged code in QEMU to simplify the setup
of the ciphers data via the "tls-cipher-suites" object, but
ultimately libvirt is responsible for passing suitable -fw_cfg
args to QEMU to populate both.

I'd suggest that iPXE needs to support the equivalent kind of
concept, both CA certs, and the cipher priority.

The rationale is that the OS vendor defines CA certs and cipher
priority for the host OS, with optional local administrator
override. Any firmware QEMU runs needs to honour the host OS
settings in this area, so we should have a mechanism for pass
in the relevant data from the host for iPXE IMHO.

Daniel
