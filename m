IMO it should be realistic if you look at it from a "CI related
angle".  The pull request could still be revised and disable a single
test because of a known failure, but this would not be necessarily
related to the CI.

I certainly acknowledge the issue, but I don't think this (and many
other issues that will certainly come up) should be a blocker to the
transition to GitLab.

Even so, I have the impression that the following workflow:

 - Look at Merge Results Pipeline for MR#1
 - Merge MR #1
 - Hack on something else
 - Look at *automatically updated* Merge Results Pipeline for MR#2
 - Merge MR #2

Is better than:

 - Push PR #1 to staging
 - Wait for PR #1 Pipeline to finish
 - Look at PR #1 Pipeline results
 - Push staging into master
 - Push PR #2 to staging=20
 - Wait for PR #2 Pipeline to finish
 - Push staging into master

But I don't think I'll be a direct user of those workflows, so I'm
completely open to feedback on it.

I am not sure GitLab "Specific Runners" can be used from other
accounts/forks.  AFAICT, you'd need a MR to send jobs that would run
on those machines, because (again AFAICT) the token used to register
those gitlab-runner instances on those machines is not shareable
across forks.  But, I'll double check that.

The most important tool we'd have at the CI level is to "allow
failures" indeed.  GitLab CI itself doesn't provide the concept of
different tiers, so effectively we'd have to mimic that with jobs that
will not be blocking.  What I think we should use is, have a well
defined methodology, and tools, to either promote or demote
failing/passing jobs.

For example, a newly introduced job will always be in "allow failure"
mode (similar to Tier 2), until it proves itself by running reliably
for 100 runs or 2 months, whatever comes last.  Likewise, a job that
is not allowed to fail (similar to a Tier 1) would be demoted if it
fails twice and is not repaired within 24 hours.

Yes, the idea is to close the gap as much as possible, and make what
we already have on qemu.git available to CI/gitlab-runner and
vice-versa.

Cool, thanks for the pointer and feedback!
