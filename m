So without unrestrict guest the mainline is this:
KVM set guest's rflag bit X86_EFLAGS_VM, so when the guest enter guest
mode, it is in vm86 mode.
In this mode, the CPU will access the address like in real
mode(seg*4+offset), this address is linear address. And in fact, the vm86
is still
in protected, so the linear address will be translated to gpa by the
identity mapping table. Then goes to EPT table?

Is this understanding right?

Could you please explain this situation more detailed? Why this happen?
