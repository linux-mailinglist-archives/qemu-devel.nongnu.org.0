Thank you very much for the clarification!

I found tlb_set_page with size != TARGET_PAGE_SIZE makes the translation
way too slow; the Linux doesn't seem to boot.

If that's the only way to reduce PMP granularity to less than
TARGET_PAGE_SIZE,
Can we just set the PMP default granularity to TARGET_PAGE_SIZE as it did
before?

OR

Can we bypass the partial match violation when size is unknown? (check the
starting address only)

I think both of the options does not exactly match with the ISA
specification,
but given that size=0 always causes the problem, I want it to be fixed as
soon as possible.

Any thoughts would be appreciated!
