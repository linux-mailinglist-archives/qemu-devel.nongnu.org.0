So yeah. The resons is that there is actually no bug at this point
because the controller only supports PRPs. I actually thought there was
a bug as well and reported it to qemu-security some months ago as a
potential out of bounds access. I was then schooled by Keith on how PRPs
work ;) Below is a paraphrased version of Keiths analysis.

The PRPs does not cross page boundaries:

    trans_len = n->page_size - (prp1 % n->page_size);

The PRPs are always verified to be page aligned:

    if (unlikely(!prp_ent || prp_ent & (n->page_size - 1))) {

and the transfer length wont go above page size. So, since the beginning
of the address is within the CMB and considering that the CMB is of an
MB aligned and sized granularity, then we can never cross outside it
with PRPs.

I could add the check at this point (because it *is* needed for when
SGLs are introduced), but I think it would just be noise and I would
need to explain why the check is there, but not really needed at this
point. Instead I'm adding a new patch before the SGL patch that explains
this.
