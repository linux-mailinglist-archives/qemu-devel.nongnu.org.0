So I looked at the simplest of all cases (discard) and I am not convinced yet
that this is the right approach. I can understand why it looks like this fits
into the MemoryListener, but I am not sure if gives us any real benefits or
makes the code any clearer (I'd even say it's the contrary).


+void memory_region_notify_discard(MemoryRegion *mr, hwaddr offset,
+                                  hwaddr size)
+{
+    hwaddr mr_start, mr_end;
+    MemoryRegionSection mrs;
+    MemoryListener *listener;
+    AddressSpace *as;
+    FlatView *view;
+    FlatRange *fr;
+
+    QTAILQ_FOREACH(listener, &memory_listeners, link) {
+        if (!listener->region_discard) {
+            continue;
+        }
+        as = listener->address_space;
+        view = address_space_get_flatview(as);
+        FOR_EACH_FLAT_RANGE(fr, view) {
+            if (fr->mr != mr) {
+                continue;
+            }
+
+            mrs = section_from_flat_range(fr, view);
+
+            mr_start = MAX(mrs.offset_within_region, offset);
+            mr_end = MIN(offset + size,
+                          mrs.offset_within_region + int128_get64(mrs.size));
+            mr_end = MIN(mr_end, offset + size);
+
+            if (mr_start >= mr_end) {
+                continue;
+            }
+
+            mrs.offset_within_address_space += mr_start -
+                                               mrs.offset_within_region;
+            mrs.offset_within_region = mr_start;
+            mrs.size = int128_make64(mr_end - mr_start);
+            listener->region_discard(listener, &mrs);
+        }
+        flatview_unref(view);
+    }
+}

Maybe I am missing something important. This looks highly inefficient.

1. Although we know the memory region we have to walk over the whole address
    space ... over and over again for each potential listener.

2. Even without any applicable listeners (=> ! VFIO) we loop over all listeners.
    There are ways around that but it doesn't make the code nicer IMHO.

3. In the future I am planning on sending populate/discard events
    without the BQL (in my approach, synchronizing internally against
    register/unregister/populate/discard ...). I don't see an easy way
    to achieve that here. I think we are required to hold the BQL on any
    updates.

memory_region_notify_populate() gets quite ugly when we realize halfway that
we have to revert what we already did by notifying about already populated
pieces ...
