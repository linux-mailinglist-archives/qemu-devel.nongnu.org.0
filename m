Adding a ditto to this.

$ qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -hda mydisk.vdi -accel hvf -vga std
qemu-system-x86_64: warning: host doesn't support requested feature: CPUID.=

This is for a customized Ubuntu install.

Guest window repeatedly alternates between the desktop, then flickers to
terminal with the following text:

/dev/sda4: recovering journal
/dev/sda4: clean, 93356/1264800 files, 1076062/5056592 blocks
[  OK  ] Started xrdp session manager.

=3D=3D Host system =3D=3D

- macOS 10.14.6
- Bluetooth mouse and keyboard


Also, the workaround of using -cpu host,-mmx,-sse doesn't work (the guest a=
ppears to never even boot).

Title:
  MMX emulation is missing on HVF Acceleration

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Robs-MacBook-Pro-2:~ robmaskell$ qemu-system-x86_64 --version
  QEMU emulator version 3.0.0

  Host: MacOS - 10.13.6
    Model Name:	MacBook Pro
    Model Identifier:	MacBookPro14,3
    Processor Name:	Intel Core i7
    Processor Speed:	2.8 GHz
    Number of Processors:	1
    Total Number of Cores:	4
    L2 Cache (per Core):	256 KB
    L3 Cache:	6 MB
    Memory:	16 GB

  Guest OS: Elementary Linux Loki 0.4.1, patched up to date

  Command used to start QEMU:

  qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -name ElementaryLokiDev \
    -machine pc,accel=3Dhvf \
    -cpu max \
    -smp cpus=3D2,sockets=3D2,cores=3D1,threads=3D1,maxcpus=3D2 \
    -numa node,nodeid=3D0 \
    -numa cpu,node-id=3D0,socket-id=3D0 -numa cpu,node-id=3D0,socket-id=3D1=
 \
    -m 8G \
    -vga vmware \
    -hda e4.qcow2

  Symptoms: Started without the -smp / -numa commands to install the OS,
  then added -smp / -numa and the machine boots and lscpu reports extra
  cpu as expected. Restart VM and it hangs on startup. Remove -smp /
  -numa and machine starts again.
