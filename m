Oh, I didn't realize that was the case. And of course it already
takes a number of quadwords as argument, I suppose? That's pretty
unfortunate :(

Perhaps we could consider deprecating it in favor of a user-friendly
variant that's actually suitable for regular humans, like the one I
suggest above?

I thought about it a bit more and perhaps the simplified design is
better after all.

Whatever the interface looks like on the QEMU side, we're going to
want to offer libvirt users two options for configuring vector
lengths: listing all desired vector lengths explicitly (basically
sev-vl-map but more verbose and readable) and providing just the
biggest desired vector length (like in sev-max-vq).

In the latter case, we'll want to expand the user-provided value
into an explicit list anyway in order to guarantee guest ABI
stability, and doing so when a single bitmap has been obtained via
QMP seems like it would be more manageable.

Sorry for the flip-flop, but after all isn't this exactly what
upstream design discussion is supposed to be all about? :)

I'm probably missing something entirely obvious, but couldn't you
just have a single, possibly fairly massive (up to 128 hex digits if
I'm not mistaken) value on the command line and just work with that
one, no arrays necessary?
