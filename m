Because many people might be using this option without ever reading the docs, 
e.g. because of being suggested by copy & paste tutorials or any stack*.com 
forum.

No, it is not a feature. It is still a fix. :) I cannot use 9p without this 
fix at all, so it is not some optional "feature" for me.

x-remap would just make things unnecessarily more complicated without adding 
anything useful.

A warning/info log could be used to motivate people providing feedback and 
make them clearly aware about their current version still being an 
experimental fix in their specific qemu version. That warning/info is just a 
one line change that can easily be dropped at some point in future after this 
qid fix proofed to be reliable (i.e. from users' feedback and test cases).

Most people are using libvirt xml configs instead of calling qemu directly 
with command line options. So of course I will suggest a libvirt patch as soon 
as this patch set is pulled on qemu side.
