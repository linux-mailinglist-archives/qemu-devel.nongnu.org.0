The only reason I used these slots is that I know sadly that I'll have to resend and
rebase this patchset for a while, and every time a test with the number I use is added,
this causes relatively hard to fix conflict (or at least I don't know how to fix these conflicts effectively)

Thus I used safe numbers, but at the rate this task progresses I won't be surprised that when this is merged,
these will be test numbers to use...

TL;DR - these are placeholders, and once the patch set is blesssed for merging upstream I'll update this next
available numbers.

Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
