This "chip" is part of an integrated southbridge/superio/everything chip 
the also includes the two PICs and how they are internally connected is 
not known so we would be guessing here anyway. I don't see a need to make 
it more complicated than it is now by modeling internal pins but how would 
I wire up gpio to the i8259 model and where should I connect the PCI irq?

The 82C686B says this reg can be 0 or 1, where 0 is legacy interrupt 
routing and 1 is native mode. Given that we only model native mode of the 
chip it does not make sense to set it to anything else than 1 and setting 
it to 0 confuses MorphOS and Linux on pegasos2 while setting it to 1 works 
with everything I've tried both on pegasos2 and fulong2e even if that may 
not completely match how it's implemented in hardware.

Guests distinguish by looking at the parent device (function 0) which is 
the chip this IDE device is part of (on function 1).
