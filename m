After reading change logs, I believe USB support for raspi2/raspi3 is
not added yet. Which means host internet network can't be accessed by
emulated machine.

I would be glad to help in documentation of differences between real
Raspberry Pi devices and QEMU emulated raspi2/raspi3 since I have seen a
lot of tutorials on internet trying to use QEMU for emulating raspberry
pi. These tutorials most of the times are just hacks, like using
versatilepb or using custom kernel instead of the Raspbian OS.

I have gathered as much info as possible over the last week through
these tutorials, QEMU raspi code and change logs, and believe a good
documentation of this info could help future users trying to emulate
raspi.

Finally, I am able to run latest Raspbian OS (2019-07-10) lite version
on raspi2 using the following command where I have extracted kernel
image and dtb file from second partition:

qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -kernel bootpart/kernel7l.img -dtb
bootpart/bcm2709-rpi-2-b.dtb -drive file=3D2019-07-10-raspbian-buster-
lite.img,format=3Draw,if=3Dsd -append "rw console=3DttyAMA0 loglevel=3D8
root=3D/dev/mmcblk0p2 fsck.repair=3Dyes rootwait memtest=3D1" -serial stdio

I am not able to connect network devices, not able to use images other
than lite image (https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1837347) and
unsure why this command is showing Hardware name as BCM2835 when the
QEMU raspi code has BCM2836 associated with raspi2
(https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/59c58f96b270f5edd4ad10954c3a96556cb3a728=
/hw/arm/bcm2836.c#L31).

I highly appreciate the support provided for raspi2 and raspi3 till now.

Thank you.
