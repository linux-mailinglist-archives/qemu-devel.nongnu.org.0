I'm not sure that auto ids was actually merged.
(I thought it wasn't)

Anyway auto IDs are not directly related to enabling CPU hotplug for ARM,
if you feel they should be generated you can try to propose patches.

As far as CPU devices in QEMU are created with help of -device/device_add
with 'id' provided it should work with current code.

From discussion with Drew [CCed], I got that kvm/arm isn't designed
to support vCPU hotplug (and it would require heavy refactoring to
separate GIC and VCPUs, which probably won't be welcomed by maintainers).

But that's only KVM side of the equation. Assuming that we don't
touch KVM much, the only QEMU side is left.

Further lets call
 * vCPU - a kvm's part of CPU
 * CPU - QEMU object which is linked to vCPU via file descriptor.

In QEMU we have CPU devices which optionally might create vCPUs
during device realize time (if QEMU runs with KVM accelerator).

So from design point of view, I'd suggest to dynamically
create/remove CPU devices on demand using existing
 -device/device_add/device_del interface
like we do for other architectures.

But in case of running with KVM accelerator, to accommodate
current non dynamic ARM/KVM, I'd move vCPU creation to "kvm_init()"
time or board init time, so it would pre-create vCPUs in
KVM early in parked state and put them in 'kvm_parked_vcpus' list
but won't create CPU devices for them.

Then later when management adds CPU device either with
'-device' or 'device_add', a new CPU device will pick up
pre-created parked vCPU file descriptor and re-use it.

Parked vCPU infrastructure is already exists in QEMU as we use it
for hot-unplugged CPUs for the same reasons (it needs too much
refactoring on KVM side to really remove vCPU).

So when CPU is hot-unplugged, we put linked vCPU file descriptor
into kvm_parked_vcpus (see: kvm_destroy_vcpu) and completely delete
CPU device on QEMU side. Then when the same CPU is hot-plugged again,
we reuse previously parked vCPU file descriptor (see: kvm_get_vcpu).

I think we understand cold-plugged vcpus differently.
From QEMU point of view there are 2 kinds of cold-plugged CPU devices.

Ones that are currently created by board directly following pattern

 object_new()
 set properties
 relalize

these are created (lets call them builtin) in amount specified by -smp X
and are not manageable by external applications.

The second kind of cold-plugged CPUs are the ones created on command
line with help of:

 -device cpu-type-foo

these are created by management applications and could be hot-removed
if management supplied 'id'. For example libvirt starts qemu with 1
built-in cpu in paused mode (-s) QEMU, then it hotplugs via QMP N cpus
and lets VM run (it's essentially the same as using -device on CLI).
This way it can remove all CPUs except of 1st one which is good enough
in almost all the cases.

In ARM case, I'd consider to implementing -device/device_add support first.
So it would be on par with other architectures in QEMU that support cpu hot=
plug.

Then try to implement id auto-generation on top and discuss if making
built-in CPUs hot-removable is worthwhile, as it's a separate issues
and could be done later.

Separating feature on distinct self-sufficient chunks usually makes
reviews/merging easier comparing to trying to do everything at once.
