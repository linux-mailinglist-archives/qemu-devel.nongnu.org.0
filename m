This is an instance of QemuOpts features undermining each other.

error_report() uses the "current location".  A few judiciously placed
loc_FOO() ensure many error_report() just work.  For instance, anything
within main()'s two loops over argv[] has the current location point to
the current option or argument.

= QemuOpts feature #1: capture option location =

A struct QemuOpts stores a complex option for later use.  Since many
such later uses call error_report(), it captures the option's location,
so you can make the current location point to it again.  It's even
automatic with qemu_opts_foreach().

= QemuOpts feature #2: option merging =

You can request multiple options to be merged[*] by putting .merge_lists
= true into the QemuOptsList.  qemu_machine_opts does.  -machine a=b
-machine x=y gets merged into -machine a=b,x=y.

= The two feature don't want to play with each other =

With option merging, we can have any number of *actual* option
locations, but QemuOpts can capture just one, so we arbitrarily capture
the first one.  In your example, that's "-machine virt", which is
misleading, because the offending location is actually "-M 8G".

By the time we realized the features don't play with each other, we were
too deeply invested into both features to say "either feature is fine,
but we can't have both".

To make them play, we'd have to capture locations at the struct QemuOpt
level instead.  Looks like an awful lot of work just to make a few error
messages less confusing.  Makes me sad, because I do value decent error
messages.



[*] Multiple options with the same ID.  A detail that isn't relevant
here, I think.  Can explain if you're curious.
