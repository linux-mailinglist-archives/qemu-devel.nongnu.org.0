Yes.

CLI, config file and QMP are differently convenient for different use
cases.

When you want to tweak just a few things for a single run, or a few in a
row, nothing beats the CLI.

A bespoke, long-lived configuration you really want to keep in a file.

When you use a program to run QEMU, and that program does QMP anyway,
doing *everything* in QMP can be just what you want.

If we could afford just one of the three, we'd probably want to pick
QMP, because it's the most flexible (it's supports queries naturally),
and because picking something else can't eliminate QMP.  Fortunately, we
don't have to pick just one if we base on initial configuration on QAPI.

A QMP command is "send an instance of a QAPI type to QEMU, get an
instance of a QAPI type or an error back".

A CLI option or configuration file entry is the same with the return
type constrained to "nothing".

The hard part is designing the QAPI type and putting it to use in QEMU.
Wrapping it in a QMP command is utterly trivial.

Wrapping it in a CLI option is no harder (we've done it a few times).
Right now, it takes some boilerplate.  We can eliminate the boilerplate
the exact same way we did for QMP commands: generate it.

Wrapping a bunch of QAPI types in a configuration file format is a bit
more work, mostly because the bikeshed will need a coat of paint.

object-add and device-add are the last two genuine users of 'gen': false
(query-qmp-schema does it out of laziness, and my "Configurable policy
for handling deprecated interfaces" series makes it stop).

I'd like to take a serious swing at QAPIfying them, with a loose schema.
Good enough for QAPI-based initial configuration interfaces.  Not good
enough for introspection, but a better QOM introspection could fill that
gap.
