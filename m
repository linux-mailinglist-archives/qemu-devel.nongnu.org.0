You don't say anything about the kernel image you're trying to boot, but
"nothing happens" is the expected result of trying to run a kernel which
is not correctly configured to run on QEMU. You can debug in the same
way you would debug "my kernel didn't boot on real hardware": try the
gdb debugstub, try looking at the kernel config and comparing against a
working version, etc.

https://translatedcode.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/installing-debian-on-
qemus-64-bit-arm-virt-board/ is an example of a working setup of an
aarch64 guest, which is probably a good place to start.
