Pavel,

By "structure", did you mean structure of patches?

Let's say, after the all ISA instruction patches are introduced, we first
introduce one real board of our choice (only infrastructure, with almost
empty content, than devices on that board, than the corresponding SoC/MCU
infrastucture, than device in that SoC.

Additional boards would follow the same pattern, potentially reusing
already implemented devices, or whole SoC/MCU.

One more question:

We already saw that devices within SoC/MCUs for AVR platform exibit great
variation. First, there are around 17 generation of AVR cores (avr1, avr2,
... xmega7). Than, there is, I think 600+ SoC/MCU models (hard to believe,
but true). Each SoC defines its devices, and in potentially different way
(not only its starting address, but real differences in terms of
functionality). I thought that at least for a particular core, the devices
would be defined in a consistent way, but even that is not true - for
example ADC for a SoC having core X can be significantly different that ADC
for another SoC having the same core X.

How to deal with such avalanche of devices? How to organize and maintain 27
significantly different versions of ADC; and 53 significantly different
versions of Watchdogs (the numbers are invented by me, but are likely to
describe the situation well)?

Best regards,

Aleksandar
