Agreed.

Sorry for not catching your point, and I like the virtiofsd to do
READ/WRITE requests and qemu handle metadata requests, as virtiofsd is
good at processing dataplane things due to thread-pool and CPU
affinity(maybe in the future). As you said, virtiofsd is just acting as
a vhost-user device which should care less about ctrl request.

If our concern is improving mmap/write/read performance, why not adding
a delay worker for unmmap which could decrease the ummap times. Maybe
virtiofsd could still handle both data and meta requests by this way.
