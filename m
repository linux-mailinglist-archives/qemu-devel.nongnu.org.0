Are you using host backing on real NVDIMM? Currently, we only support backing image 
file on regular SSD. We have plans to support backing file on real NVDIMM device
as well but this is part of future work.

Can you please try by allocating a raw image file on regular SSD. It is working fine
for me.

Will look at this if it is related.
