Note, there is nothing SVE-specific about this.

Either enabling features on a per-vcpu basis is justified, or it isn't:
if it's justified, then it would be better to have a general way of
specifying per-vcpu properties, rather than it being reinvented per
feature.

Creating mismatched configurations is allowed by the architecture and so
it's useful for testing the kernel, but probably less useful for real-
world use cases today.

So it may be a good idea to get the symmetric support sorted out first
before thinking about whether and how to specify asymmetric
configurations.
