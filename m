>=20

Sure, using ::1 for IPv6 and 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 cases would work. The quest=
ion is whether the behavior is really expected. In migration it was conside=
red dangerous, because you can have 2 VMs starting the migration at the sam=
e time. They both might attempt to get the same port, one would receive IPv=
4 the other IPv6. Then depending on the order of start migrate you might en=
d-up attempting to migrate the other VMs instead of the intended ones.

The same can happen here, you might start 2 nbd exports at the same time, g=
et the same port without any failures and then depending on luck get the ri=
ght or wrong export when attempting to connect. So I think bailing out in c=
ase we fail to get all interfaces would be the most appropriate (note the s=
ame situation is for 0.0.0.0 where you might end-up serving multiple differ=
ent disks on different interfaces). Anyway I leave it to you. If you decide=
 you don't want to fail than using ::1/127.0.0.1 sounds like a good idea. O=
therwise it'd make sense to create a test that especially uses ::1 and then=
 localhost to make sure it bails-out.
