And none of that is an NMI. This is a completely SW-defined mechanism,
and you can't rely on this to inject something that would behave as
a NMI in in a guest. I thought the "pseudo" prefix would give it away 
:-(.

The x86 NMI has no equivalent on ARM, full stop. And the only thing that
the ARM implementation should follow is the letter of the architecture,
without added concepts.

But what architectural concept would you map your KVM_NMI to? The number
of things you can do is pretty limited:

- Reset: we already have this
- Interrupt: you don't get to decide the priority or the group
- SError: Pretty much fatal in all cases

You *could* try something like SDEI [1], but that's a pretty terrible
interface too.
