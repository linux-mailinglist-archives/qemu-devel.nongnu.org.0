Gentlemen,=0A=

Thank you for your input. =0A=

Peter,=0A=
=0A=
I completely understand your concern. Rest assured, this project is entirel=
y internal and requires no code contribution, unit testing, etc. from QEMU =
devs. We simply want to garner as much documentation as possible to ensure =
optimal conversion/compatibility. My team and I have already completed a ma=
jority of our instruction set mapping into TCG. Lately however, we've encou=
ntered issues with floating point operations. =0A=
=0A=
I noticed in the TCG Readme that floating point operations are no longer of=
ficially supported but were previously (per the last paragraph in 4.1).=0A=
=0A=
Can you please provide documentation for implementing the latter?=0A=
=0A=

...and *don't* look at older/less maintained targets (including=0A=
x86), as they have a lot of bad habits you don't want to copy.=0A=
Using 'decodetree' is probably a good idea.=0A=

=0A=
I would also add=0A=
3.  Don't expect getting this implemented and upstream to be easy.=0A=
=0A=
(Apologies if the following sounds pessimistic and off-putting;=0A=
but I would prefer people to have a clear understanding of=0A=
what they're getting into and not assume the chances of=0A=
success are higher than they might actually be.)=0A=
=0A=
"New TCG target" is an unlucky combination of:=0A=
 (1) it's quite a lot of work in pure amount-of-code terms=0A=
 (2) because it is a big feature it is not a good choice as a "first=0A=
   contribution to the project", but new targets often are proposed=0A=
   and written by people who don't have any previous history of=0A=
   writing QEMU code=0A=
 (3) we already have targets for the common CPU ISAs, so=0A=
   anything new is likely to be obscure and not have many people=0A=
   who care about it either in our userbase or in our dev community.=0A=
   (riscv is the obvious recent exception here, as it is clearly relevant=
=0A=
   as a new architecture and has attracted multiple people to work=0A=
   on it and contribute both code and reviews)=0A=
=0A=
1 and 2 mean that code review of a new TCG target is a lot=0A=
of work, and 3 means it's not clear how much return the project=0A=
gets for that investment :-(=0A=
=0A=
There is not a large community of upstream developers who are=0A=
interested in maintaining a lot of obscure guest architectures:=0A=
we essentially rely on the goodwill and not-entirely-work-time=0A=
of just a few people when it comes to reviewing new TCG targets.=0A=
That means that patchsets often hang around on list for a long=0A=
time without getting attention.=0A=
=0A=
Our past historical experience has often been that when people=0A=
contribute TCG targets, we do a lot of work on our end with=0A=
code review and helping to get the code into upstream QEMU, and=0A=
then these people more or less disappear, leaving us with the=0A=
burden of something we have to support and no help doing it.=0A=
If in general people submitting new TCG targets were all=0A=
*helping each other*, passing on what they learned to the=0A=
next person along, contributing code review, updating older=0A=
code as QEMU APIs improve/churn, etc, then I think I'd feel=0A=
differently about this. But to be honest mostly I find myself=0A=
thinking "oh dear, not another one".=0A=
=0A=
We already have two new TCG ports with patches on list=0A=
which are kind of stalled due to not having enough existing=0A=
upstream QEMU devs who can/will code review them (and=0A=
another which hasn't had patches posted but might do soon).=0A=
The odds for your new port having a happier future don't seem=0A=
too great to me :-(=0A=
=0A=
thanks=0A=
