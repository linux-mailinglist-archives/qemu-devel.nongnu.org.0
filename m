+1 on this.

Next thing that will predictably follow is a userspace ABI to
create those aggregators and have them go away if the
process creating it dies. Something to think of...

Yeah there is not really any "standard" GPIO, but if the user is running
e.g. a Versatile Express model, that has a PL061 GPIO, and then
a user would create an "aggregator GPIO" with say 8 lines and
QEMU would pick that up as /dev/gpiochipN and bind it inside
of QEMU to the lines of the virttualized PL061 GPIO controller,
so the machine thinks it is using a PL061 but in reality it is
just 8 GPIO lines on the host computer.

That sounds quite interesting as well.

Then the virtualized machine can just pick this "virtio GPIO" and
some command line switches or config file on the host can
set up and route a GPIO aggregator.
