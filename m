Yes, it does trigger with tcg-on-x86 as well. I've been using

s390x-softmmu/qemu-system-s390x -M s390-ccw-virtio,accel=tcg -cpu qemu,zpci=on 
-m 1024 -nographic -device virtio-scsi-ccw,id=scsi0,devno=fe.0.0001 
-drive file=/path/to/image,format=qcow2,if=none,id=drive-scsi0-0-0-0 
-device scsi-hd,bus=scsi0.0,channel=0,scsi-id=0,lun=0,drive=drive-scsi0-0-0-0,id=scsi0-0-0-0,bootindex=1 
-device virtio-net-ccw

It seems it needs the guest actually doing something with the nics; I
cannot reproduce the crash if I use the old advent calendar moon buggy
image and just add a virtio-net-ccw device.

(I don't think it's a problem with my local build, as I see the problem
both on my laptop and on an LPAR.)
