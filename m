I think you, for some reason, mix and keep mixing two really different
things:

- outline of your changes (as seen as points 1-5 above)

- a patch

None of points 1-5 could be a patch. All of them should be patch series, or
part of patch series.

I am surprised that it seems as if you did not take a look at the previous
cases of platform introductions to QEMU. Or you did, but decided you don't
need to bother creating patch series, you don't need to follow QEMU
submission guidelines - you apparently think you can simply send the
changes as several huge patches.

We in MIPS also have ISA verification software that can be viewed as "gold
standard", but we don't burden QEMU with any imported files - and we
certainly could, using the same rationale as you do.

I am opposed to considering the output (or a part) of an internally
developed simulator more important than (or on the same level as)
documentation, and calling it a "gold standard".

A gold-standard-related question arises here:

If something is called a "gold standard", should it be a constant, by its
very definition?

Also, you did not answer my question from my previous resoonse, which was:

What do you expect to be changing in imported-from-another-simulator code?

And I add another one:

What exactly components of QEMU for Hexagon are contained in
imported-from-another-simulator code?

Thanks,
Aleksandar

&gt; Taylor, if I understood you well, these files don&#39;t confirm to QEM=
U coding standard, because they are imported. But, from where? And what is =
the reason they need to be imported (and not created independently by you o=
r somebody else, but within QEMU code style guidelines) ?<br>
&gt; Their content looks fairly simple to me.<br>
