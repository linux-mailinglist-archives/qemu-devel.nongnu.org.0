It needs a Make target to run those flaky tests (If we ever agree on=20
this idea of flaky tests). Other Avocado flags are passed (e.g. -t for=20
tags) that can happen to fail tests on their absent. One clear example=20
is the spice test on patch 02 of this series...

Side note: check-acceptance seems to get growing in complexity that I=20
worry will end up in pitfalls. is a Make target the proper way to=20
implement complex test runs (I don't think so). Perhaps Avocado runner=20
concept could help somehow?

It seems to me that flaky test is just a case in a broaden scenario: run=20
(or not) grouped tests. You may have tests indeed broken or that takes=20
considerable time (those tagged "slow") which one may fairly want to=20
exclude from `make check-acceptance` as well. Thus some way to group=20
tests plus define run inclusion/exclusion patterns seems the ultimate=20
goal here.

I agree that all flaky test should have a tracking bug. In the end it=20
represents a technical debit that we should address.
