Fully agree with that.

2^27 is the maximum NVME page size, but in theory, but only in theory,
you can have blocks larger that a page size, you will just have to give the controller
more that one page, even when you read a single block.

But like I said in the other mail, Linux doesn't support at all block size > cpu page size which is almost always 4K,
thus 12 is the practical limit for the block size these days, and of course both 27 and 31 is well above this.

So I'll send a patch to fix this today or tomorrow.
