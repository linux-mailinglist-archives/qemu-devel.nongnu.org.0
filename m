The core was incomplete, but running under gdb directly shows that it
is just a bog-standard config space access (first for that device).

The cause of the crash is that nc->peer is not set... no idea how that
can happen, not that familiar with that part of QEMU. (Should the code
check, or is that really something that should not happen?)

What I don't understand is why it is set correctly for the first,
autogenerated virtio-net-ccw device, but not for the second one, and
why virtio-net-pci doesn't show these problems. The only difference
between -ccw and -pci that comes to my mind here is that config space
accesses for ccw are done via an asynchronous operation, so timing
might be different.

Yep, that would be useful... so patchew only builds the complete series?

I think so, as it makes s390x unusable with more that one
virtio-net-ccw device, and I don't even see a workaround.
