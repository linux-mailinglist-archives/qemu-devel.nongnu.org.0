Yup, no problem. I'm actually liking the idea of the single map plus
flags. We won't need two implementations (QEMU and libvirt), we'll
only need one (libvirt). The QEMU QMP side will only need to state
what should be implemented using the flags. Also, as we already
agreed, we need TCG and KVM flags anyway, so we're already in flag
land.

We could, and I like the idea. It just hadn't crossed my mind due to
implementation tunnel vision.

Thanks,
