I don't mind, as long as the CI run doesn't take more than (say)
1h to 1h30 elapsed time to complete from kicking it off to getting
all the results back. The specific set of x86 configs tested don't
really worry me (as long as we do have a reasonable spread):
the thing I really care about is that we get the multiple
host architectures and the BSDs into the test setup. (We already
have about five different ways of doing CI testing of x86 Linux
hosts, which is the least likely setup to break. It's the
other host configs that I'm really keen to see progress on
automation of, because that's what's really blocking us from
being able to move off my hand-coded scripting.)

In the long run we should probably aim for being consistent about
what we test between the pull-request tests and whatever the
'public-facing CI' part is.

If we have a CI setup where KVM reliably works then we should
ideally test a --disable-tcg setup somehow. Right now my pullreq
tests don't test that because I run them on my work desktop box
and (as the config says) sometimes I'm running VirtualBox which
causes KVM to fail -- but that should be irrelevant to our CI
runners...
