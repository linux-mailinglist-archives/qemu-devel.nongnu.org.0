I can see this critique. OTOH, and as Peter has written, it's also a 
fine way to find a list of candidate bugs that we may have forgotten about.

Ideally people still post a link to the patch if they move it to "in 
progress" so we get the benefits of both methods. I usually try to link 
to a mailing list thread whenever I update a BZ/LP like this. I can keep 
that habit alive here.

It might be fine as simply an informational state that we just don't 
treat as authoritative/exhaustive.

Yeah, I don't expect us to do all of our release planning in Gitlab. 
This is merely a convenient way to associate an issue with a release.

I'm personally willing to do SOME of the janitoring here; in that I can 
associate closed issues with a release milestone and -- when preparing 
for rc0 freeze -- punt off any bugs that aren't blockers/in-progress to 
the next milestone.

I don't expect it would become an *exhaustive* list of changes, just 
merely a way to associate the things that DID make it into the issue 
tracker with a release.

It may allow us to publish a nice list in the changelog with links to 
the gitlab issue tracker each release, which might be nice because issue 
tracker bugs are often ones that end-users filed, so it's a way to pay 
very visible attention to that feedback.

Definitely nothing stopping us from adding those labels outside of the 
Workflow scope.

"Regression" might be nice for highlighting issues for inclusion into 
the next stable release.

"Release blocker" could be just as well served by inclusion in the 
upcoming Milestone. (Granted: there would be no difference between stuff 
that's puntable or not-puntable, so there may indeed be some use to a 
"Blocker" label.)

"Important" might be best served by the "weight" fields, and might be a 
bit too subjective.

I think I am rather fond of having the scoped labels for the sake of 
making the "Board" view interesting to look at.

Open --> Triaged --> Confirmed --> In Progress --> Closed

In this view, each column suggests work that can be done to help move it 
along the pipeline. Tagging open bugs will be an important step in 
making this issue tracker useful to everyone.

We *could* move everything to individual labels, but I find a benefit to 
scoped labels is that you can't mis-use them by applying more than one, 
so there's less janitoring to do.

I also like that scoped labels suggest the full lifecycle of the issue, 
so you don't have to dig through the full list of labels.

(Also: if you don't know about ANY of the Workflow labels, the board 
view provides a canonical overview, so it's a fairly discoverable process.)

Thanks for the feedback today, on IRC and now on-list. :~)
