Dead code is always a maintenance burden, even if it's not a very
large one. It means that somebody reading the code and working
on it has to think "maybe I need to do something to cater for these older
versions in my new feature I'm working on, maybe I need to test on
older versions" when they don't. It makes code harder to read when
it's got a bunch of ifdefs in it.

But is anybody actually going to fix pre-10.12 support? They've
had six months so far... If we had a good sized body of developers
taking active care of how well QEMU on OSX works, I would be
entirely happy for them to decide amongst themselves what they
thought was a reasonable version support policy for OSX. But
we just don't.

I wouldn't object to a configure check if anybody wanted to write
a patch to add one.

Indeed, and none of those is the 10.11-and-earlier that this patch
drops attempts to cater for. The patch does still keep 10.12 and
10.13 support alive, even though it's not strictly required by
our support policy, because building for those host versions does
in practice still work.
