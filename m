Not sure; probably the safest is getting the kernel to SIGKILL it - but
that's a complete nightmare to debug - your process just goes *pop*
with no apparent reason why.
I've not used SIGEV_THREAD - it looks promising though.

Yes, you need something to enable it, and some safe way to retrigger
the timer.  A qmp command marked as 'oob' might be the right way -
another qm command can't block it.
