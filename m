IIUC, most of this code is simpy copied as-is from the fuse or linux
git repos. I'm wondering what the intention is for it long term ?

For header files, I would have expected us to be able to compile against
the -devel package provided by the kernel or fuse packages. I can
understand if we want to import the headers if the VSOCK additions to
them are not yet widely available in distros though. If this is the case
we should put a time limit on how long we'd keep these copied headers
around for before dropping them. It would be fine to violate QEMU coding
style in this case as its not code QEMU would "maintain" long term - just
a read-only import.

The source files though, we appear to then be modifying locally, which
suggests they'll live in our repo forever. In this case I'd expect to
have compliance with QEMU coding standards.

I'm surprised we need to copy so much in from fuse though. Is there a
case to be made for fuse to provide a library of APIs for people who
are building fuse daemons to link against, instead of copy & fork ?

Daniel
