now we also can't take bzip2 for granted because that's "too old" for some =
other build OSes? This is ridiculous.

We're not saying bzip2 is too old / missing from the OS. Every OS we care
about has bzip2. The problem is that a minimal installation migt not have
installed it. This kind of problem is increasingly common with use of
minimal container images for example. So we're just ensuring we validate
that what we want is actuall present.
