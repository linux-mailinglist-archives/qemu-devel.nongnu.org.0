The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.
