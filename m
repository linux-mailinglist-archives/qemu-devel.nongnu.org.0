Agreed, but note that we can relax restrictions later if we want, but
enforcing restrictions later is an ABI break.

The only disk format I'm aware of which uses !512 and !4K sectors are
CD ROMs (2K sector size), although libguestfs reads those without any
problems today.  Even if you consider NASes where 64K sectors are
normal, they still use 512 or 4K logical sectors (with lots of
horrible read-modify-write cycles).
