Neither should happen with a correctly written mgmt app in charge.

When launching a QEMU process for an incoming migration, it is expected
that the mgmt app has first queried QEMU on the source to get the precise
CPU model + flags that were added/removed on the source. The QEMU on
the target is then launched with this exact set of flags, and the
'check' flag is also set for -cpu. That will cause QEMU on the target
to refuse to start unless it can give the guest the 100% identical
CPUID to what has been requested on the CLI, and thus matching the
source.

Libvirt will ensure all this is done correctly. If not using libvirt
then you've got a bunch of work to do to achieve this. It certainly
isn't sufficient to merely use the same plain '-cpu' arg that the
soruce was original booted with, unless you have 100% identical
hardware, microcode, and software on both hosts, or the target host
offers a superset of features.

Daniel
