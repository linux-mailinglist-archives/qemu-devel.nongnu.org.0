Read-only for the guest, right. I used the term "user" here and

It does, in fact. This is to allow unprivileged direct access to memory 
regions (as well as the register space), i.e. to enable the guest OS to 
map the regions without overlaps.

That the guest can decide (via BAR) where the resource should show up in 
the physical guest address space. We do not want to support this in 
setups like for static partitioning hypervisors, and then we use that 
side-channel read-only configuration.

Right, that is the behavior. The reasoning is in the second half of my 
short explanation: We want to use for setups like UIO, where the final 
consumer is an unprivileged application. That applicaiton shall not be 
able to cause incoming interrupts at a rate higher than its own 
schedule. And that is achieved by forcing it to re-enable IRQs (via 
directly mapped MMIO regs) when it actually runs again.

Yes, this is no optimization for kick-related vmexits. I would consider 
that an application-level thing, doable - like in virtio - via 
protocol-specific fields in the shared memory.

Which if fine and should actually work as-is when mapping virtio over 
ivshmem. Other ivshmem protocols may implement their own peer-to-peer 
hints for skipping kicks.

The interpretation of addresses in the shared memory is completely up to 
the protocol used on top of ivshmem, thus is out of scope for this spec. 
The protocol may use relative addresses or some other basis. If fact, it 
should use relative addresses because this ivshmem spec does not provide 
means to tell all peers if they see the shared memory at the same guest 
physical base addresses.

Maybe we should clarify the second aspect: If shared memory is described 
via the side-channel, it is still a resource separate from guest RAM. 
That is at least how Jailhouse implements it, and I do not see a use 
case yet for doing it differently.

Well, we are already in incompliance when we allow PBA to be 
non-functional or when we make INTx and edge interrupt. Both is to make 
things virtualization friendly (low overhead for the guest, low effort 
for the host). If compliance has a strong use case, we can allow that, 
but I would like to see the use case first.

Was thought of as "either ... or". No implementation for I/O exists so

In fact, I would then rather consider to drop the (so far unused) I/O 
option to avoid having to implement that even more complex case.

It's a configuration thing of your hypervisor, in practice. The 
hypervisor should allow the system configurator to specify also larger 
sizes of the MMIO region. We just had the case that TI needed 64K for 
the kernel of their J721e SDK (which I suggested them to avoid, but for 
different reasons).

Yes, that is the current model. I didn't consider of per-vector control 
so far. That's probably because UIO does not support multiple vectors, 
and there was no other use case for this register yet. If we added 
per-vector support, we would limit the vector number or would need more 
registers...

ID refers to the ID register. Target is what the doorbell is targeting.

Yes. I think I didn't consistently switch from the former more abstract

It's an optimizing requirement: When the guest does not know if the 
hypervisor uses a synchronizing mechanism to actually submit the 
interrupt, it has to add an unconditional barrier in case it is actually 
needed. In contrast, it is easy for the hypervisor to add a barrier when 
the kick mechanism should in come with an implicit one.

Yes, single-vector INTx is not optimal. But the state table is in RAM, 
and it will only become noteworthy when you have dozens of peers. In 
that case, I would indeed recommend providing an MSI-X implementation.

Markus already asked if we couldn't drop INTx. On the long run, he is 
right as most newer SOCs come with support for MSI-X, thus the guests 
can also handle virtually injected events. Existing SOCs do not always, 
so that's why INTx is here.

One reason is to provide non-virtio "devices" or rather simple 
application-to-application protocols. Many embedded hypervisor offer 
this already today, as it is simple and "flexible" (hacky...). But the 
other reason is to provide the simplest possible transport for virtio 
(from the hypervisor POV) that does not require knowing all the 
countless details of virtio. Such a stack will allow to keep the trusted 
hypervisor core untouched when adding a new virtio device. Try that with 
PCI or MMIO transport. The price of implementating virtio natively into 
a 5-10 thousand LoC hypervisor is simply too high. Or it ends up in 
non-robust, insecure or even worse architectures.

Thanks for the feedback!
