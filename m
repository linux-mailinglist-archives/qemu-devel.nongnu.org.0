I think I've figured it out!

Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge hosts encounter this panic because the
"additional resources" bar size is too big, at 1 << 36.  If I change
this to 1 << 35, no more kernel panic.

Skylake and later are fine with 1 << 36.  In between Ivy Bridge and
Skylake were Haswell and Broadwell, but I couldn't find anybody who was
able to help me test on either of those, so I don't know what they do.

Perhaps related, the hosts that produce panics all seem to have a
physical address size of 36 bits, while the hosts that work have larger
physical address sizes, as reported by lscpu.
