Thank you for summarizing the whole history. To make things clear I do
not put into question this last approach, I just meant the commit
message should justify why this is needed and why the existing
IOMMUMRNotifier approach cannot be used.

vSMMU does not require it at the moment. But in that case, it shall not
provide any implementation for it and that should be sufficient,
shouldn't it?

OK so let me try to rephrase:

"the HostIOMMUContext is an object which allows to manage the stage-1
translation when a vIOMMU is implemented upon physical IOMMU nested
paging (VFIO case).

It is an abstract object which needs to be derived for each vIOMMU
immplementation based on physical nested paging.

An HostIOMMUContext derived object will be passed to each VFIO device
protected by a vIOMMU using physical nested paging.
"

Is that correct?

 Also, if we want, actually we could migrate

So then it becomes contradictory to what we said before because
