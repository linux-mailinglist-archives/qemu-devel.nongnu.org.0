Hi Stefan

Perhaps we were not too clear about our work in the previous email.
Our assumption was that the question that came from KVM Forum was
if muser can be used to achieve the same what we have now.
We should have answered clearly yes to this question.  We have not yet
discovered major road blocks.
At the moment, we are mostly engaged in learning the code and discussing
the design, plus some coding to answer the specific questions.
We understand that the best way to make a progress is to work with the
upstream community on early stages and we agree with this and will present
the proposal shortly for discussion.

Absolutely, that is our plan. At the moment we do not have the patches
ready for the review. We have setup internally a milestone and will be
sending that early version as a tarball after we have it completed.
Would be also a meeting something that could help us to stay on the same
page?

We use IRC (I know Jag got some answers there) and github for issues
(one of which was addressed). We are hoping to get the conversation going over
the email.
