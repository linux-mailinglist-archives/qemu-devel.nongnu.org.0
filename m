This text says that using zlib in the extension is not necessary because
it's the default. But it doesn't say that using zlib in the extension is
illegal.

I agree that there is no good reason to create a compression type
extension if you have zlib. But is there a good reason to forbid it? It
only requires us to add artificial restrictions to code that would work
fine without them.

Either way, if we want to reject such extensions, the spec needs to say
that it's illegal. And if the spec allows such images, we must accept
them.

Increasing the header size is backwards compatible. Older qemu versions
should handle such images correctly. They would store the unknown part
of the header in s->unknown_header_fields and keep it unmodified when
updating the image header.

We would still add the incompatible feature flag for non-zlib, of
course.
