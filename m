It is initialized when QEMU is started, but if it dies, that's not
detected until the first PR command.  The command is retried for 5
seconds, which should give libvirt ample time to restart the PR manager
(and it's an exceptional situation anyway).

This is true.

Note that qemu-pr-helper supports the systemd socket activation
protocol.  Would it help if libvirt used it?
