Hi, Paolo and Michal:

Let me add some details about this problem.


reappear steps:

1. in Host, execute the following command many times quickly:

"ps aux|grep helper|grep -v grep|grep -v qemu-kvm|awk '{print $2}';ps aux=
|grep helper|grep -v grep|grep -v qemu-kvm|awk '{print $2}'|xargs -n1 kil=
l -9"

2. at the same time , execute PR command continuously in Guest

just execute step 1 and 2 for a moment, the problem will appear.


when the problem appeared:

1. qemu will initialize pr-helper and connect to it cyclically, but alway=
s failed because no running pr-helper process to connect.

2. libvirt will always waiting for connected event, but will never to sta=
rt new pr-helper process because not receive disconnect event.


I'm not found the best way to solve this problem, can you give me some su=
ggestion?
