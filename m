Sure, thanks. I did not mean to claim the simple test I've done was 
sufficient but I expect others who have interest in this and more 
experienced in such testing (or even being payed to work on QEMU which I'm 
not) contribute to this so I did not try testing it more throughly than 
just showing it could be considerably faster and still work fot at least 
some workloads so it's worth working on. I'm surprised that in the two 
years since hardfloat was merged nobody even tried this (or those who did 
dropped the idea before any results without letting us know). So I tried 
to make a start with it to explore what would it take to fix this 
eventually but I don't want to do that alone. I hope this inspires others 
to help e.g. in thesting and we can reach a solution together.

I don't have real hardware and testing against QEMU may take longer and 
not sure how useful. There could also be preexisting bugs, although some 
fixes were made to PPC FP implementation recently. Maybe I'll have a look 
if have no better things to do but I have other ongoing QEMU related 
projects as well that I might try to make some progress as well.

It is expected to break inexact exceptions currently until a better way 
can be found to handle those but I think hardfloat is already disabled for 
other than default rounding modes or FPU settings so maybe those should 
not break. According to:

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=fpu/softfloat.c;h=301ce3b537b6c0eee5dbbc358587b66a3a341d2a;hb=HEAD#l235

  235 static inline bool can_use_fpu(const float_status *s)
  236 {
  237     if (QEMU_NO_HARDFLOAT) {
  238         return false;
  239     }
  240     return likely(s->float_exception_flags & float_flag_inexact &&
  241                   s->float_rounding_mode == float_round_nearest_even);
  242 }
  243

and

https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=fpu/softfloat.c;h=301ce3b537b6c0eee5dbbc358587b66a3a341d2a;hb=HEAD#l99

   99 /*
  100  * Hardfloat
  101  *
  102  * Fast emulation of guest FP instructions is challenging for two reasons.
  103  * First, FP instruction semantics are similar but not identical, particularly
  104  * when handling NaNs. Second, emulating at reasonable speed the guest FP
  105  * exception flags is not trivial: reading the host's flags register with a
  106  * feclearexcept & fetestexcept pair is slow [slightly slower than soft-fp],
  107  * and trapping on every FP exception is not fast nor pleasant to work with.
  108  *
  109  * We address these challenges by leveraging the host FPU for a subset of the
  110  * operations. To do this we expand on the idea presented in this paper:
  111  *
  112  * Guo, Yu-Chuan, et al. "Translating the ARM Neon and VFP instructions in a
  113  * binary translator." Software: Practice and Experience 46.12 (2016):1591-1615.
  114  *
  115  * The idea is thus to leverage the host FPU to (1) compute FP operations
  116  * and (2) identify whether FP exceptions occurred while avoiding
  117  * expensive exception flag register accesses.
  118  *
  119  * An important optimization shown in the paper is that given that exception
  120  * flags are rarely cleared by the guest, we can avoid recomputing some flags.
  121  * This is particularly useful for the inexact flag, which is very frequently
  122  * raised in floating-point workloads.
  123  *
  124  * We optimize the code further by deferring to soft-fp whenever FP exception
  125  * detection might get hairy. Two examples: (1) when at least one operand is
  126  * denormal/inf/NaN; (2) when operands are not guaranteed to lead to a 0 result
  127  * and the result is < the minimum normal.
