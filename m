If you're capable of writing a Coccinelle script that actually does what
you want, I bet you dollars to donuts that you can decide which options
actually affect the patch in comparably no time whatsoever ;)

If you prefer to bother your reader with your personal choices, that's
between you and your reviewers.  Myself, I prefer less noise around the
signal.

You don't.  The "just work-flow" options by definition do not affect the
patch.

If you got Coccinelle installed and know the very basics, then the
incantation in the script should suffice to use the script, and the
incantation in the commit message should suffice to reproduce the patch.

If you know nothing about Coccinelle, the README should get you started.

Example:

    commit 4e20c1becba3fd2e8e71a2663cefb9627fd2a6e0
    Author: Markus Armbruster <armbru@redhat.com>
    Date:   Thu Dec 13 18:51:54 2018 +0100

        block: Replace qdict_put() by qdict_put_obj() where appropriate

        Patch created mechanically by rerunning:

          $  spatch --sp-file scripts/coccinelle/qobject.cocci \
                    --macro-file scripts/cocci-macro-file.h \
                    --dir block --in-place

        Reviewed-by: Eric Blake <eblake@redhat.com>
        Signed-off-by: Kevin Wolf <kwolf@redhat.com>

scripts/coccinelle/qobject.cocci has no usage comment.  I doubt it needs
one, but I'd certainly tolerate something like

    // Usage:
    // spatch --sp-file scripts/coccinelle/qobject.cocci \
    //        --macro-file scripts/cocci-macro-file.h \
    //        FILES ...

I'd even tolerate throwing in --in-place.  But --use-gitgrep is too much
for my taste.

Anyone with basic Coccinelle proficiency benefits slightly from the
reduction of noise.

Coccinelle noobs benefit from the more verbose instructions in the
README.  Duplicating those in every script is not maintainable.

Maintainers benefit slightly from less redundancy.
