Makes things a lot easier.

Maybe I should try to move patch 15 earlier. The series is mostly just
in the order that I wrote things, but there were also a few nasty
dependencies in the part the generalises things from NBD to BlockExport.
So I'm not sure if this is a patch that can be moved.

So should I or not? :-)

This makes sense. Nobody likes having to rewrite their RFC series.

But there is one thing I dread even more: Polishing the RFC series for
another week until I can send it out as non-RFC and _then_ having to
rewrite it.

Basically just telling you that I was already interested in your input
for this point specifically when I sent the series.

I usually send RFC patches when I know that I wouldn't consider them
mergable yet, but I don't want to invest the time to polish them before
I know that other people agree with the approach and the time won't be
wasted.

In many cases (and I think this is one of them in large parts), I only
really learn what the series will look like when I write it.

I could have sent a design RFC for the QAPI part, but I didn't expect
this to be contentious because it's just the normal add/del/query thing
that exists for pretty much everything else, too.

I can try. I seem to remember that you had a reason not to do this the
last time we discussed generalised exports, but I'm not sure what it
was.

The obvious one could be that the block export layer doesn't know which
permissions are needed. But it can always start with minimal permissions
and let the driver do a blk_set_perm() if it needs more.
