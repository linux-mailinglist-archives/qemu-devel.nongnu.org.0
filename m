The "configuration parameters" describe variations in the hardware
interface and device state representation. I'll rework this section and
just call them "device parameters" with a fuller explanation of their
purpose.

Yes, the next part that talks about link speed is an example of how to
represent cases where certain aspects of the port do matter.

Based on the feedback I've gotten about this section, I think it was a
confusing example. I will rework this to make it clearer.

Do you mean guest-visible IOMMU groups? In that case the vIOMMU (which
is a separate device) contains that information.

Yes, the example is problematic. I will rework it.

The configuration describes the maximum set of features and device
resources. Some of them may not be utilized at runtime, but the
destination still has to provide them just in case they are used.

It's conservative because it refuses all migrations that could run into
trouble. However, it also refuses some migrations that could succeed.

As mentioned, detecting those cases is too complex and risky. Better
safe than sorry.

Yes, there is some freedom for the device designer to choose whether to
migrate values as part of the device state or to make them configuration
parameters.

Versions are just a shorthand. The configuration parameters are what is
compared to check migration compatibility.

If the configuration parameters differ then migration is not allowed.

Usually two versions specific different configuration parameters, so
migration between versions is not allowed.

You are right. When I wrote the document I assumed the destination will
always be a freshly-instantiated device, but it was pointed out that
devices may be pre-existing (e.g. from a pool of available VFIO
devices).

The sub-thread with Alex Williamson discusses how to set parameters
using mdev and VFIO sysfs attrs. It will be possible to configure an
existing device without creating a new instance.

Thanks. I agree, there needs to be a way to report all available
configuration parameters and device versions.

It could be done either way. The device model is parameterized so it's
not necessary to define a unique URI for each sub-model.

If the device state representation and the hardware interface is similar
then using a single device model URI and expressing the differences
using configuration parameters seems reasonable.

A device model does not necessarily correspond to a single PCI
Device/Vendor ID, just like a Linux driver does can support many PCI
Device/Vendor IDs.
