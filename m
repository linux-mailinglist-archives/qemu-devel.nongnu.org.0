I don't understand what this means, I thought vfio-pci followed a very
standard device model.

So you're looking more for some sort of frontend-backend separation, we
hot-unplug the frontend device that's exposed to the guest while the
backend device that holds the host resources is still attached.  I
would have hardly guessed that's "like all our other devices".  I was
under the impression (from previous discussions mostly) that the device
removal would be caught before actually allowing the device to finalize
and exit, such that with a failed migration, re-adding the device would
be deterministic since the device is never released back to the host.
I expected that could be done within QEMU, but I guess that's what
we're getting into here is how management tools specify that eject w/o
release semantic.  I don't know what this frontend/backend rework would
look like for vfio-pci, but it seems non-trivial for this one use case
and I don't see that it adds any value outside of this use case,
perhaps quite the opposite, it's an overly complicated interface for
the majority of use cases so we either move to a more complicated
interface or maintain both.  Poor choices either way.  Thanks,

Alex
