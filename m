Well, quite often it makes little sense still.

For example, in debian we had to (temporarily) move qemu-system-i386 from
/usr/bin/ to /usr/libexec/, replacing the /usr/bin/ one with a shell wrapper
(to decouple xen hvm build out of main qemu build). It was just by a chance
the directory nesting is the same still, - I wanted to move it to /usr/lib/qemu/
instead.  But at least this one still works.  Ditto for the actual xen version,
the binary is in /usr/libexec/qemu-system-i386-xen now, I was about to move it
to /usr/libexec/xen/qemu-system-i386 instead.

I see absolutely no reason for the binary to look into /usr/libexec/share/qemu/bios.bin
if it is told to get all data files from /usr/share/qemu/.

Quite often I debug issues and have to compare "old" qemu with current one
(exactly like I did in this case), extracting the old binary into /tmp/.
And wonder why it breaks in other ways.

And I still don't see how this turning absolute paths into relative (behind the
scenes) can be useful. If we put qemu into /usr/local/bin for example, it
can be configured to look for data files in /usr/local/share just fine,
there's no need for this "magic". On the other hand, if we really want
to use a different data dir, we can pass a right -L option.

I think I'll just remove this (very questionable) behavior at least from the
Debian package.  I already patched out the previous version of this, when
it looked at ${exe_path}/../pc-bios - this at least made sense when we
needed to find firmware files for just-built qemu, in the source dir. But
it makes no sense (in my opinion) to do that for the installed version.

Thanks,
