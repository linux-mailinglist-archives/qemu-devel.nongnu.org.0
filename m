"json:{}" is basically -blockdev with extra steps. Old -drive usage
didn't have any way to do that apart from rewriting the image. Which is
basically the same since json:{} also needs to be recorded in the image
to take effect.

As I've elaborated in [1] I disagree with the host CVE part. The
insecure part is not probing the format itself, but probing format AND
using the backing file of the image if we probed format.

I agree that mis-probing format leads to data corruption though.

It is not a warning in libvirt though. We just refuse it now because we
don't do probing. Previously we allowed qemu to probe the format and the
only thing that prevented host CVEs was if the host used selinux or any
other security approach which would prevent opening the backing file.
