well with pci each device describes itself. you read
this description dword by dword normally. typical
description is 20-50 words.

if both bios and linux do this, that's twice the amount.

bios also uses two vmexits for each access.

there's also the resource allocation game.

I would say up to 200 exits per device is reasonable.

each bus is scanned for devices. 32 accesses, 256 bus numbers
(that's the lastbus thing). Paolo posted a hack just
for the root bus but whenever we have a bridge the problem
will just re-surface.

pcie is actually link based so downstream buses do not
need to be scanned outside device 0 unless we see
a multifunction bit set. I don't think linux
implements this optimization atm.
But still the case for internal buses.

me neither. I suspect it's not vmexit related at all.  Is ACPI driver in
linux just slow?  It's not been designed to be on any data path...
I'd love to know. I don't feel it's fair to ask someone
interested in writing new performant code to necessary optimize
old non-performant one.

maybe but who is working on this right now?

If it's possible to make PC faster but not enough people
know how to do it, and enough people know how to make microvm
faster, then it does not matter what's possible in theory.

At some level it would be great to have someone do detailed performance
profiling. But it is a lot of work, which also needs to be justified
given there's working code, and it's not bad code at that.

Yes speeding up PC would be nice but if everyone's gut feeling is it
won't get us what microvm is trying to achieve, why spend cycles making
sure?
