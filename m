You can't open the same image twice, so this won't always work.

Yes, replaying bs->file with a Quorum node that has the old bs->file as
one of its children. Or removing a Quorum node so that one of it's
children replaces it.

But this is probably not a very important use case, so I think the
restriction is not a problem. Lifting restrictions later is easier than
adding new ones.
