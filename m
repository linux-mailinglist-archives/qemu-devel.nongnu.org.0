Hi,
I've come back to this after a while and now think all the pre-load or
load-command Ideas we had were in vain.
They would be overly complex and need a lot of integration into different
places to trigger them.
All of that would not be well integrated in the trigger of the issue itself
which usually is a package upgrade.

But qemu already does try to load modules from different places and with a
slight extension there I think we could
provide something that packaging (the actual place knowing about upgrades)
can use to avoid this issue.

I'll reply to this thread with a patch for your consideration in a few
minutes.

There is already a Ubuntu 20.04 test build with the qemu and packaging
changes in [1].
The related Debian/Ubuntu packaging changes themselves can be seen in [2].
I hope that helps to illustrate how it would work overall

&gt; Hi everyone,<br>
&gt; we&#39;ve got a bug report recently - on handling qemu .so&#39;s throu=
gh<br>
&gt; upgrades - that got me wondering how to best handle it.<br>
&gt; After checking with Paolo yesterday that there is no obvious solution<=
br>
&gt; that I missed we agreed this should be brought up on the list for<br>
&gt; wider discussion.<br>
&gt; Maybe there already is a good best practise out there, or if it<br>
&gt; doesn&#39;t exist we might want to agree upon one going forward.<br>
&gt; Let me outline the case and the ideas brought up so far.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Case<br>
&gt; - You have qemu representing a Guest<br>
&gt; - Due to other constraints e.g. PT you can&#39;t live migrate (which w=
ould<br>
&gt; be preferred)<br>
&gt; - You haven&#39;t used a specific shared object yet - lets say RBD sto=
rage<br>
&gt; driver as example<br>
&gt; - Qemu gets an update, packaging replaces the .so files on disk<br>
&gt; - The Qemu process and the .so files on disk now have a mismatch in $b=
uildid<br>
&gt; - If you hotplug an RBD device it will fail to load the (now new) .so<=
br>
<br>
What happens when it fails to load ?=C2=A0 Does the user get a graceful<br>
error message or does QEMU abort ? I&#39;d hope the former.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On almost any other service than &quot;qemu representing a VM&quot; th=
e answer<br>
&gt; is &quot;restart it&quot;, some even re-exec in place to keep things u=
p and<br>
&gt; running.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Ideas so far:<br>
&gt; a) Modules are checked by build-id, so keep them in a per build-id dir=
 on disk<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- qemu could be made looking preferred in -$buildid dir fi=
rst<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- do not remove the packages with .so&#39;s on upgrades<br=
>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- needs a not-too-complex way to detect which buildids run=
ning qemu processes<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0have for packaging to be able to &quot;autoclean la=
ter&quot;<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Needs some dependency juggling for Distro packaging but =
IMHO can be made<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0to work if above simple &quot;probing buildid of ru=
nning qemu&quot; would exist<br>
<br>
So this needs a bunch of special QEMU hacks in package mgmt tools<br>
to prevent the package upgrade &amp; cleanup later. This does not look<br>
like a viable strategy to me.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; b) Preload the modules before upgrade<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- One could load the .so files before upgrade<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- The open file reference will keep the content around eve=
n with the<br>
&gt; on disk file gone<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- lacking a &#39;load-module&#39; command that would requi=
re fake hotplugs<br>
&gt; which seems wrong<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- Required additional upgrade pre-planning<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- kills most benefits of modular code without an actual ne=
ed for it<br>
&gt; being loaded<br>
<br>
Well there&#39;s two benefits to modular approach<br>
<br>
=C2=A0- Allow a single build to be selectively installed on a host or conta=
iner<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0image, such that the install disk footprint is reduced<br>
=C2=A0- Allow a faster startup such that huge RBD libraries dont slow down<=
br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0startup of VMs not using RBD disks.<br>
<br>
Preloading the modules before upgrade doesn&#39;t have to the second benefi=
t.<br>
We just have to make sure the pre loading doesn&#39;t impact the VM startup=
<br>
performance.<br>
<br>
IOW, register a SIGUSR2 handler which preloads all modules it finds on<br>
disk. Have a pre-uninstall option on the .so package that sends SIGUSR2<br>
to all QEMU processes. The challenge of course is that signals are<br>
async. You might suggest a QMP command, but only 1 process can have the<br>
QMP monitor open at any time and that&#39;s libvirt. Adding a second QMP<br=
>
monitor instance is possible but kind of gross for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Another option would be to pre-load the modules during startup, but<br>
do it asynchronously, so that its not blocking overall VM startup.<br>
eg just before starting the mainloop, spawn a background thread to<br>
load all remaining modules.<br>
<br>
This will potentially degrade performance of the guest CPUs a bit,<br>
but avoids the latency spike from being synchronous in the startup<br>
path.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; c) go back to non modular build<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0- No :-)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; d) anything else out there?<br>
<br>
e) Don&#39;t do upgrades on a host with running VMs :-)<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0Upgrades can break the running VM even ignoring this particula=
r<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0QEMU module scenario. <br>
<br>
f) Simply document that if you upgrade with running VMs that some<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0features like hotplug of RBD will become unavialable. Users ca=
n<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0then avoid upgrades if that matters to them.<br></blockquote><=
