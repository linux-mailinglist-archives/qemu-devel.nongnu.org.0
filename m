You mean the qemu-options.hx.  qemu-options.def is generated from it.

We used to have qmp-commands.hx, until QAPI swallowed it.  Command line
QAPIfication will swallow qemu-options.hx.

QAPI is much more expressive than qemu-options.hx.  All the latter can
do is "has option argument" and "option is arch-specific".  QAPI lets
you specify an option argument's structure, and supports compile-time
conditionals.  It can't do things like "must specify either argument A
or B", or "numeric argument C must not exceed argument D", or "multiple
options combine vs. last one wins".  Mostly because "it=E2=80=99s already
complicated enough as is".

A similar example from my RFC patches:

##
# @--add-fd:
# !texinfo
# -add-fd fd=3D@var{fd},set=3D@var{set}[,opaque=3D@var{opaque}]@*
#
# Add a file descriptor to an fd set.  Valid options are:
#
# @table @option
# @item fd=3D@var{fd}
# This option defines the file descriptor of which a duplicate is added to =
fd set.
# The file descriptor cannot be stdin, stdout, or stderr.
# @item set=3D@var{set}
# This option defines the ID of the fd set to add the file descriptor to.
# @item opaque=3D@var{opaque}
# This option defines a free-form string that can be used to describe @var{=
fd}.
# @end table
#
# You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:
# @example
# qemu-system-i386
# -add-fd fd=3D3,set=3D2,opaque=3D"rdwr:/path/to/file"
# -add-fd fd=3D4,set=3D2,opaque=3D"rdonly:/path/to/file"
# -drive file=3D/dev/fdset/2,index=3D0,media=3Ddisk
# @end example
# !end texinfo
##

  'data': { 'fd': 'int', 'set': 'int', '*opaque': 'str' },
  'help': [

Sane sugar can be described declaratively as macro expansion.

Less than sane sugar takes code.

Desugaring in code promotes (accidental) abandonment of sanity.

That said, we have to keep things simple to succeed.  Declarative
desugaring seems beyond our reach.

Similar to all QMP commands taking a single 'any' argument.

QOM and QAPI sabotage each other.  Ironic, considering they were dreamed
up by the same guy :)

QAPI is compile-time static by design.

QOM is run-time dynamic by design.  Some support for static definitions
has been grafted on since.

We use QAPI type system escapes for QOM.  Defeats QAPI introspection and
doc generation.  We provide separate QOM introspection instead, which is
clumsier and less expressive.  QOM documentation doesn't exist.

To make this worthwhile, we'd have to replace dynamic QOM properties by
static ones when possible.  Monumental task.
