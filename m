This is what I meant. We ignore the failure (i.e. don't return an error),
but the result still isn't completely correct ("leaked" permissions).

I'm not saying you need to do it, just that it would be cleaner. :-)

Permissions are tied to file locks, so an external process can just grab
the locks in between. But if I understand correctly, all we try here is
to have an additional safeguard to prevent the user from doing stupid
things. So I guess not being 100% is fine as long as it's documented in
the code.
