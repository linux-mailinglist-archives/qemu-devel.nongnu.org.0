AFAIU the IOVA/GPA stuff is not the problem here. You have said it
yourself, the SG mechanism would work for balloon out of the box, as it
does for the other virtio devices. 

But VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM (aka VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM)  not presented
means according to Michael that the device has full access to the entire
guest RAM. If VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is negotiated this may or may not
be the case.

The actual problem is that the pages denoted by the buffer transmitted
via the virtqueue are normally not shared pages. I.e. the hypervisor
can not reuse them (what is the point of balloon inflate). To make this
work, the guest would need to share the pages before saying 'host these
are in my balloon, so you can use them'. This is a piece of logic we
need only if the host/the device does not have full access to the
guest RAM. That is in my opinion why the balloon driver fences
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.

Does that make sense?

We need a feature bit here. We can say fencing VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
was a bug, fix that bug, and then invent another 'the guest RAM is
somehow different' feature bit specific to the balloon, and then create
arch hooks in the driver that get active if this feature is negotiated.

I assumed the fact that the balloon driver fences
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not a bug.

The issue is not with the IOMMU, the issue is with restricted access
to guest RAM. The definition of VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is such that we
pretty much know what's up when VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is not
presented, but VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM presented can mean a couple of
things.
