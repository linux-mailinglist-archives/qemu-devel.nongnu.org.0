There is no such restriction. Several opened descriptors is what allows us to survive
PCI device reset. The kernel reset device on the first open.
Obviously we shouldn't use these descriptors concurrently and can't in many cases
(ioctl()s will fail), but there is no problem with just saving/passing FD between processes.

Yeah, I had similar idea, but this would require a lot of rework of VFIO initialization
phase in QEMU. The main problem here is all initialization happens on device addition, which will fail
if device already used by another QEMU. I guess we would  need to move lot's of initialization to the
->post_load() hook.
