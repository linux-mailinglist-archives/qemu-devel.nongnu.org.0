I have sent a v2 to the kernel side of it:

https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20190529222219.27994-1-farosas@linux.ibm.com/

I'm depending on what we decide to do there. The core of this patchset
will not change, just the mechanism by which the feature is selected
(patch 2, kvm-all: Introduce kvm_set_singlestep).

Perhaps the next instruction is one that is not traced? See the programming
note at the end of section 6.5.15 in Book III.

Or maybe the step got preempted? You should see GDB messages indicating
changing threads right before or after the stdu. However that would only
happen with more than one VCPU and if 'show scheduler-locking' in GDB is
'off'. And even then, that should not cause any issues, but it is a more
complex scenario so there could be a bug in the code.
