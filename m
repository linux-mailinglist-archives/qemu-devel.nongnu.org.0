As per the comment, the removal of .impl.max_access_size was to imply that the 
ultimate limit is determined by a dynamic property more than the hard-coded limit i.e 
if you wanted to increase the stride you would increase it_shift first and then 
adjust the .impl.max_access_size to match accordingly.

At this point we're probably heading into personal preference territory, so if you 
are happy to merge this via mips-next then I'm happy for you to make the final 
decision :)
