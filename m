I am a bit at a loss here, as this has been reviewed for a while, but nothing is happening.
Rebasing is starting to become more and more draining;

I am seeing some changes from Phil that redo some of the patches here (like target arch user),
maybe you would like to drive this?

https://gitlab.com/hw-claudio/qemu/-/tree/i386_cleanup_9

is the more recent rebase, but now it is out of date again.

Phil could you help rebase this again?
Otherwise I could only get at this in about two weeks.

Thanks,

Claudio
