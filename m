Maybe we should start choosing names more carefully in a way to express what we mean?

record/replay is tcg-only.

I think that the existing code in master conflates them together actually.
Qtest can have its own counter, it does not need to be the icount instruction counter.

I don't see how this follows, how is using a global use_icount variable better than having this checked using icount_enabled()?

I will come back to this later on, this patch seems to have uncovered an underlying issue, which shows on s390.

I'd rather now continue investigating that, choosing to try to actually understand the issue, rather than hiding it under the carpet.

Thanks,
