Yes, perhaps the terminology is a bit unclear.

When I say "new cluster" is this context I mean that a write request
requires that a new cluster is allocated in the qcow2 file.

Then the "old cluster" would be what was there before the write (i.e. a
cluster with refcount > 1 or an unallocated cluster). Where we are doing
the copy-on-write from.

Good idea.

Here's one good example why I should probably add a QCow2SubclusterType
different from the existing QCow2ClusterType.

In this context, 'type' is the type of the subcluster, and because of
that _ZERO_ALLOC means that the subcluster reads as zeros but the
cluster itself is allocated. Other subcluster may contain data and
that's why we have to copy all of them.
