From: C=C3=A9dric Le Goater <clg@kaod.org>

This includes various small updates and a better description of the
chosen interrupt mode resulting from the combination of the 'ic-mode'
machine option, the 'kernel_irqchip' option, guest support and KVM
support.

+KVM negotiation
+---------------
+
+When the guest starts under KVM, the capabilities of the host kernel
+and QEMU are also negotiated. Depending on the version of the host
+kernel, KVM will advertise the XIVE capability to QEMU or not.
+
+Nevertheless, the available interrupt modes in the machine should not
+depend on the XIVE KVM capability of the host. On older kernels
+without XIVE KVM support, QEMU will use the emulated XIVE device as a
+fallback and on newer kernels (>=3D5.2), the KVM XIVE device.
+
+As a final refinement, the user can also switch the use of the KVM
+device with the machine option ``kernel_irqchip``.
