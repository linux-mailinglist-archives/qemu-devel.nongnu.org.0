I think you're only reiterating my point.  If QEMU copies all of guest
memory during the iterative phase and each time it sees that all memory
is dirty, such as if CPUs or devices (including assigned devices) are
dirtying pages as fast as it copies them (or continuously marks them
dirty), then QEMU can predict that downtime will require copying all
pages.  If instead devices don't mark dirty pages until the VM is
stopped, then QEMU might iterate through memory copy and predict a short
downtime because not much memory is dirty, only to be surprised that
all of memory is suddenly dirty.  At that point it's too late, the VM
is already stopped, the predicted short downtime takes far longer than
expected.  This is exactly why we made the kernel interface mark pinned
pages persistently dirty when it was proposed that we only report
pinned pages once.  Thanks,

Alex
