In downstream RH qemu, we run with host-physbits as default; so it's reasonably
trustworthy; of course that doesn't help you across a migration between
hosts with different sizes (e.g. an E5 Xeon to an E3).
Changing upstream to do the same would seem sensible to me, but it's not
a foolproof config.
