I'm very sorry that I hadn't send a cover letter...
Now I preparing the V2 series and I think put the cover letter of V2
here could make life easier...
----
Loongson-3 CPU family include Loongson-3A R1/R2/R3/R4 and Loongson-3B
R1/R2. Loongson-3A R1 is the oldest and its ISA is the smallest, while
Loongson-3A R4 is the newest and its ISA is almost the superset of all
others. To reduce complexity, in QEMU we just define two CPU types:

1, "Loongson-3A1000" CPU which is corresponding to Loongson-3A R1. It is
   suitable for TCG because Loongson-3A R1 has fewest ASE.
2, "Loongson-3A4000" CPU which is corresponding to Loongson-3A R4. It is
   suitable for KVM because Loongson-3A R4 has the VZ ASE.

Loongson-3 lacks English documents. I've tried to translated them with
translate.google.com, and the machine translated documents (together
with their original Chinese versions) are available here.

......

We are preparing to add QEMU's Loongson-3 support. MIPS VZ extension is
fully supported in Loongson-3A R4+, so we at first add QEMU/KVM support
in this series. And the next series will add QEMU/TCG support (it will
emulate Loongson-3A R1).

We already have a full functional Linux kernel (based on Linux-5.4.x LTS
but not upstream yet) here:

https://github.com/chenhuacai/linux

How to use QEMU/Loongson-3?
1, Download kernel source from the above URL;
2, Build a kernel with arch/mips/configs/loongson3_{def,hpc}config;
3, Boot the a Loongson-3A4000 host with this kernel;
4, Build QEMU-5.0.0 with this patchset;
5, modprobe kvm;
6, Use QEMU with TCG (available in future):
       qemu-system-mips64el -M loongson3,accel=3Dtcg -cpu
Loongson-3A1000 -kernel <path_to_kernel> -append ...
   Use QEMU with KVM (available at present):
       qemu-system-mips64el -M loongson3,accel=3Dkvm -cpu
Loongson-3A4000 -kernel <path_to_kernel> -append ...

   The "-cpu" parameter can be omitted here and QEMU will use the
correct type for TCG/KVM automatically.

Assume that you have read my cover letter now. So TCG only need to
consider Loongson-3A1000 and KVM only need to consider Loongson-3A4000
(in V2 I will define two types of CPU).
