I have tried to work in this interface in 2016. That time
we have struggled with the idea that this QMP interface should
be ready to work asynchronously.

Write-protect userfaultfd was merged into vanilla Linux
thus it is time to async savevm interface, which will also
bring async loadvm and some rework for state storing.

Thus I think that with the introduction of the QMP interface
we should at least run save VM not from the main
thread but from the background with the event at the end.
