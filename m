Microsoft has updated their driver to 10.0.18362.356 and the sound is
now working with the audoidev hda.

Title:
  HDA device non functional in Windows 10 1903

Status in QEMU:
  Fix Released

Bug description:
  I made the update to 1903, and the HDA device stopped working.

  The driver says the device is working correctly, but it does not.
  When I try to open the Windows sound configuration, the dialog hangs and =
never shows it's content.

  Several people reported this back in May:

  https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-v1903-ich6-ich9-virtio/

  I can confirm I have exactly the same problem.

  Host is Arch Linux, current (5.2.5) kernel, QEMU 4.0.

  I enabled HDA debug output and compared an older, working Windows
  version to 1903, but could not see the difference. The driver seems to
  issue the same verbs.

  I am happy to provide additional information if needed.
