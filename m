Not necessarily.  Rather, if the value of an unknown field can be safely=20
ignored, then it should default to 0.  If it cannot be safely ignored,=20
then that field will not be set to a non-zero value without also setting=20
an incompatible feature flag, so that software that does not know how to=20
interpret the field will fail to load the image because it also fails to=20
recognize the associated new incompatible feature bit.

But I'd really like Kevin's opinion on how much wording is worth adding.

Both good.

Rather wordy but seems accurate.  Perhaps compress it to:

3. Any additional field whose value must not be ignored for correct=20
handling of the file will be accompanied by a corresponding incompatible=20
feature bit.

and maybe even reorder it to list the points as:

Additional fields have the following compatibility rules:
1. Any additional field whose value must not be ignored for correct=20
handling of the file will be accompanied by a corresponding incompatible=20
feature bit.
2. If there are no unrecognized incompatible feature bits set, an=20
additional field may be safely ignored other than preserving its value=20
when rewriting the image header.
3. An explicit value of 0 will have the same behavior as when the field=20
is not present.

As long as we never add new fields that are not 8-byte aligned=20
(including any explicit padding), then we will never have the case of=20
dividing fields in the middle by keeping the header length a multiple of 8.
