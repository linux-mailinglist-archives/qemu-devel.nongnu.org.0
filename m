That's the long term plan, but we can only add that different type of
config file once all options are QAPIfied and QAPIfication has the
problem of having to deal with -readconfig.

But there is a replacement: Put everything back into the command line
and keep it in a shell script. Config files with -readconfig were never
complete enough to fully describe a VM, so it's not too unlikely that
you'll already have that script anyway.

Fine with me. That would make introducing the new config file format a
priority, though, even if it can't support every option yet (similar to
-readconfig). I didn't have the impression so far that we are planning
to do that. Is anyone working on it?
