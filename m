The MAINTAINERS file could help us with that, we already have scripts
to parse its sections.
Maintainers should keep it up-to-date, then the merge script would check, i=
.e.:

<newline> // section separator
--------------- // ignored
Trivial patches // description ignored
M: Michael Tokarev <mjt@tls.msk.ru>
M: Laurent Vivier <laurent@vivier.eu> // must match commit author
T: git git://git.corpit.ru/qemu.git trivial-patches
T: git https://github.com/vivier/qemu.git trivial-patches // must
match MR source
