This is what the application buffer property is supposed to handle, i.e.
you'll have a single device, all applications share it and the property
tells which buffer belongs to which application.

The guest driver should cleanup properly (i.e. unregister all buffers)
when an application terminates of course, no matter what the reason is
(crash, exit without unregistering buffers, ...).  Doable without a full
device reset.

Independent from that a full reset will be supported of course, it is a
standard virtio feature.

I was thinking more about a simple guest-side publishing of buffers,
without a backchannel.  If more coordination is needed you can use
vsocks for that for example.

Using vhost for the host-side implementation should be possible too.

Yes.
