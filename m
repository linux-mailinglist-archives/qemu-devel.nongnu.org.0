This series uses python logging to enable output conditionally on
iotests.log(). We unify an initialization call (which also enables
debugging output for those tests with -d) and then make the switch
inside of iotests.

It will help alleviate the need to create logged/unlogged versions
of all the various helpers we have made.

Also, I got lost and accidentally delinted iotests while I was here.
Sorry about that. By version 9, it's now the overwhelming focus of
this series. No good deed, etc.

001: replace "atom" name with "item". Kept RBs.
005: Alphabetized excluded warnings list. Kept RBs.
     Kevin's comments addressed by using pylint >=3D 2.2.0
009: Added Max's RB.
     Updated commit message based on Max's response
     Kevin's comments addressed by mypy >=3D 0.620
010: Fixed type hints (Kevin)
011: Replace 'Collection' with 'Sequence' to work around pylint/python 3.6
013: Update type signatures of _verify functions (Kevin)
014: Minor whitespace changes as the fault handler gets shuffled around.

V9:
006: New.
007: Split from old patch.
008: Split from old patch; enhanced a little to justify its own patch.
010: New, pulled in from bitmap-populate series. Helps line length.
011: Reflow columns for long `typing` import list. (Kept RB.)
014: New blank line. (Kept RB.)

V8:
- Split out the little drop of Python 3.4 code. (Phil)
- Change line continuation styles (QEMU Memorial Choir)
- Rebase changes; remove use_log from more places, adjust test output.

V7:
- All delinting patches are now entirely front-loaded.
- Redid delinting to avoid "correcting" no-else-return statements.
- Moved more mutable list corrections into patch 4, to make it standalone.
- Moved pylintrc up to patch 5. Disabled no-else-return.
- Added patch 6 to require line length checks.
  (Some python 3.4 compatibility code is removed as a consequence.)
- Patch 7 changes slightly as a result of patch 4 changes.
- Added some logging explainer into patch 10.
  (Patch changes slightly because of patch 6.)

V6:
 - It's been so long since V5, let's just look at it anew.
