appears the random number generator produces different results on 32-bit
arches, while my code seems to work fine in qemu

Title:
  [feature request] awareness of instructions that are well emulated

Status in QEMU:
  Invalid

Bug description:
  While qemu's scalar emulation tends to be excellent, qemu's SIMD
  emulation tends to be incorrect (except for arm64 from x86_64)--i have
  found this both for mipsel and arm32. Until these code paths are
  audited, which is probably a large job, it would be nice if qemu knew
  its emulation of this class of instructions was not very good, and
  thus it would give up on finding these instructions if a "careful"
  operation is passed.
