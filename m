Hi, versions 2.5 and 2.11 are quite old (though version 2.10 fixed the
bug mentioned in the Red Hat BZ, so I think this might be a different
bug.)


It's not clear at what step this is failing or where you are seeing the err=
or message, so:

1. What is your full command line for QEMU?
2. Do you see this error message when migrating? If so, what does the desti=
nation QEMU command line look like?
3. Does the problem reproduce on a currently-supported upstream QEMU? (4.1.=
1, 4.2.0)

Title:
  Cannot create cdrom device with open tray and cache option

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  When trying to create cdrom device with open tray and either of
  "cache" or "discard" options specified, I get the following error:

  qemu-system-x86_64: -drive if=3Dnone,id=3Ddrive-
  ide0-0-0,readonly=3Don,cache=3Dwriteback,discard=3Dunmap,throttling.iops-
  total=3D900: Must specify either driver or file

  This bug essentially forbids live migration of VMs with open cdrom
  trays.

  I was able to find the same bug at RedHat:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3D1338638

  The bug was encountered in versions 2.5 and 2.11.
