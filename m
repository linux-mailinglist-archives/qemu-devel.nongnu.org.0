Yes, that's to be expected if the host policy doesn't know about the
label that the guest is using.

IOW, non-mapping case is only useful if you have a very good match
between host + guest OS policy. This could be useful for an app
like Kata because their guest is not a full OS, it is something
special purpose and tightly controlled.

For general purpose guest OS virtualization remapping is going to be
effectuively mandatory.  The non-mapped case only usable when you tightly
control the guest OS packages from the host.
