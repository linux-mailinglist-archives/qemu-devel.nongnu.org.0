The magic order is there already. I call it "freak order" instead of "magic", because this is more the result of uncontrolled code growth rather than the work of magic :-)

This patch attempts to remove one degree of freedom, but the current situation of cpu realizing is basically fubar. This patch attempts to improve things slightly,
but as mentioned elsewhere it basically fails to achieve the goal,

so I am tempted to just retire it. Maybe someone interested could look at the situation with new eyes (possibly even me later on).

Ciao,

Claudio
