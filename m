It seems there is a big gap from where we are now to a full QAPI startup 
support.
Could we adopt a plan which would allow us to progress from where we are 
to full QAPI support in small steps ?

For example, the following:

  1. CLI/QMP interleaving seems to be big issue right now. We could 
solve this by making -preconfig stop only after all CLI options are 
"consumed".
For example if you give -preconfig and some -device, qemu won't stop 
before having created the devices.

Meaning you would do
$qemu [out-of-order CLI with -preconfig] then jump into the monitors.

Depending on your use case, you would have to give a few CLI options so 
that -preconfig stops early enough.

  2. Then we can enable QMP commands one by one corresponding to 
unsupported and needed/cleaned up CLI options. They will check and/or 
advance the phase/runstate.

Basically this would mean we have to first convert CLI options that are 
used last in the startup procedure.
Along the road we will be able to make -preconfig stop earlier and earlier.

You could do a ~0% CLI startup at any point during the development
$qemu -monitor... --preconfig
but you would have a reduced set of configuration possibilities due the 
lack of QAPI support.

In addition, optionally, if we want to go with the left-to-right CLI 
parsing and reading a CLI script file like Markus proposed, we could 
have something like:
$qemu [out-of-order CLI] --preconfig [in-order CLI]
with [in-order CLI] being a 1:1 equivalent of QMP commands. [in-order 
CLI] will still be parsed and executed before jumping in the monitors.
