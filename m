I added the CVE number, though I don't have a title.

This makes sense to me. Do you want to send this as a follow-up patch?
I'd like to keep the CVE fix itself minimal.

assert() isn't an error check, but it means that we deem it impossible
for the assertion to fail. This would be the case because we fixed (in
this patch) the only code path that we think could cause the problem.

We would only add it to find other buggy code paths that we missed or
that are added later.

Guests can't issue operations that span past the end of the drive. They
would return an error befor the iscsi driver is even called.

The only reason why we get such a request here is because of an internal
call with BDRV_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES. Maybe this should actually be changed
into MIN(BDRV_REQUEST_MAX_BYTES, bs->total_sectors * BDRV_SECTOR_SIZE),
and then iscsi_co_block_status() could assert that the request doesn't
span past the end of the drive.

In any case, we don't get an invalid request here. We are who made the
request. It's an unexpected response that we got.

For this reason, we generally don't log things for failed I/O requests.
If we wanted to introduce it, we'd better find a way to do so
consistently everywhere and not just in a single place with a one-off
option.
