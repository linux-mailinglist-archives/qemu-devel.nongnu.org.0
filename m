Let's use a non-terminal

    help = 'help' | '?'
    key-val = key '=' val | help

The grammar leaves a small, but important unsaid, or rather said only in
the accompanying prose.

 * Additional syntax for use with an implied key:
 *
 *   key-vals-ik  = val-no-key [ ',' key-vals ]
 *   val-no-key   = / [^=,]* /

tries to express that with an implied key, the grammar changes from

     S = key-vals

to

     S = key-vals | key-vals-ik

See, "additional syntax".  Felt clear enough to me when I wrote it.  It
is not.

Unfortunately, this simple grammar is ambigious: "help" can be parsed
both as

    "help" -> help -> key-val -> key-vals -> key-vals-ik

and

    "help" -> val-no-key -> key-vals-ik

Ham-fisted fix:

    val-no-key = / [^-,]* / - 'help'

I'm not a fan of the exception operator.  Better ideas?

I'll have a closer look at the actual patch next.

The series spans "Command line option argument parsing" (this patch),
"QOM" (next two), and qsd (final one).  I'm fine with you taking it
through your tree.

Just noticed: you neglected to cc: the QOM maintainers.  Recommend to
give them a heads-up.
