After looking more closely at the data I can see that there is a peak of
~30K IOPS during the first 5 or 6 seconds and then it suddenly drops to
~7K for the rest of the test.

I was running fio with --ramp_time=5 which ignores the first 5 seconds
of data in order to let performance settle, but if I remove that I can
see the effect more clearly. I can observe it with raw files (in 'off'
and 'prealloc' modes) and qcow2 files in 'prealloc' mode. With qcow2 and
preallocation=off the performance is stable during the whole test.
