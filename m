Hi; thanks for this patch. I can see the situation you're trying to address,
but I can't find anything in the docs that convinces me that this change
is the right way to fix it.

The problem we have is that the a9_gtimer_update() function (which is
going to get called after this code at the end of the a9_gtimer_write()
function) updates the gtb->status bit based on whether the timer has
currently passed the compare value. So effectively we do the "has the
count gone past the compare value" check not only when the timer expires
but also at every register write. My best guess is that the real hardware
only does an expiry-check when it does a counter value update. If that's
the case then in the situation you outline the guest clearing the event
flag should mean that the interrupt is not re-asserted until the counter
next increments past the compare value (ie not for a little while) whereas
with your patch it will be instantly re-asserted.

(Unfortunately the A9 TRM is not clear on the behaviour here. It would
probably be possible to write some test code to check the real h/w
behaviour.)

thanks
