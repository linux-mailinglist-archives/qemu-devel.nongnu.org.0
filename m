Hmm - raw external files are incompatible with backing files.  Should we 
also document that extended L2 entries are incompatible with raw 
external files?  (The text here reminded me about it, but it would be 
the text earlier at the incompatible feature bits that we edit if we 
want that additional restriction; compare to the restriction in the 
autoclear bit 1).  After all, when raw external file is enabled, the 
entire image is allocated, at which point subclusters don't make much sense.

And in stating that, it looks like we have a pre-existing hole in that 
header bytes 8-15 don't mention the incompatibility with autoclear (when 
things are incompatible, it's best to mention the restriction from both 
sides, rather than only one of the sides, to make sure the reader 
notices the restriction regardless of which field they look up first). 
But tweaking that would be a separate patch.
