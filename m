Theoretically, locking on a raw file needs to be protocol-compatible 
with loop-mounting the same raw file, so if the loop driver doesn't 
probe those magic byte offsets to prevent out-of-order block writes,
then there is little point for the qemu raw driver to do so.

This applies to both the loop driver in the host kernel and the loop
driver on any other machine with file share access to the sane image
file.

As for upgrading, I will try newer kernels packaged for the Debian
version used, once the current large batch job has completed, but I 
doubt it will make much difference given the principles I just stated.



Enjoy
