Ok, but I see a problem with checking the return value of this
ioctl from userspace. If this ioctl is run on older kernels that don't
support this ioctl, we get -ENOTTY as return value. We shouldn't be
exiting in that case.

It looks like we may need a new KVM capability to advertise the presence
of KVM_PPC_SVM_OFF ioctl (or more generally, to advertise host kernel's
capability to support secure guests). 

Paul - Do you think we should add such a KVM capability? Here is the
summary of the problem:

1. QEMU invokes KVM_PPC_SVM_OFF ioctl from machine reset path and currently
   we don't check for its return value.
2. On host kernels that support secure guests,
   2a. this ioctl returns 0 for regular guests and has no effect.
   2b. the ioctl can fail for secure guests and here we could check the
       return value and exit the guest right away.
3. On host kernels that don't support secure guests, ioctl returns -ENOTTY
   but we ignore the return value and continue the reset as this is
   for a non-secure guest.

If we have such a KVM capability, we could invoke the ioctl only if it
is supported and handle the return value appropriately.

Regards,
Bharata.
