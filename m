Public bug reported:

Hi,

After trying qemu master:
commit 474f3938d79ab36b9231c9ad3b5a9314c2aeacde
Merge: 68d7ff0 14f5d87
Author: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 21 15:40:50 2019 +0100

I found several regressions compared to qemu-3.1 when running the GCC tests=
uite.
I'm attaching a tarball containing several GCC tests (binaries), needed sha=
red libs, and a short script to run all the tests.

All tests used to pass w/o error (one of them is verbose), but with a
recent qemu, all of them make qemu crash:

qemu: uncaught target signal 6 (Aborted) - core dumped

This was noticed with GCC master configured with
--target arm-none-linux-gnueabi
--with-mode arm
--with-cpu cortex-a9

and calling qemu with --cpu cortex-a9 (the script uses "any", this makes
no difference).

I have noticed other failures with arm-v8 code, but this is probably the
same root cause. Since it's a bit tedious to manually rebuild & extract
the testcases, I'd prefer to start with this subset, and I can extract
more if needed later.

Thanks
