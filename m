This series is motivated by this blog that describes how RHEL-9=0D
will recommend use of the x86-64-v2 microarchitectural ABI level:=0D
=0D
  https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/01/05/building-red-hat-enterprise=
-linux-9-for-the-x86-64-v2-microarchitecture-level/=0D
=0D
The implication of compiling code with -march=3Dx86-64-v2 is that=0D
this code will no longer be guaranteed to be runnable on a=0D
number of the CPU models exposed by the x86_64 target emulator,=0D
most notably qemu64 which is the default.=0D
=0D
This series is not proposing to change the QEMU default CPU model=0D
for x86_64 target. I show how this is can trivially be done in=0D
patch 3, but not suggesting that we actually do that, as upstream=0D
is quite conservative in dropping support for old host hardware.=0D
=0D
New CPU models=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0D
=0D
It is instead exploring the possibilities of defining new CPU=0D
models in QEMU to closely match the x86-64 uarch ABI levels in=0D
a relatively vendor agnostic manner. This could be used by=0D
downstream vendors who wish to target specific uarch ABI levels=0D
in custom machine types.=0D
=0D
One of the nice things about "qemu64" is that its naming presents=0D
it as effectively being a vendor-neutral model (if we ignore that=0D
vendor=3DAMD is in fact reported in CPUID).=0D
=0D
If we look at the feature set fo x86-64-v2 ABI, we see that the=0D
QEMU "Nehalem" model is the closest match. This is also happens=0D
to be runnable on AMD Opteron G4/G5 and EPYC hosts. None the less,=0D
the use of an Intel specific CPU model name on an AMD host feels=0D
uncomfortable.=0D
=0D
Vendor neutral naming=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0D
=0D
The idea behind this series is thus to introduce new CPU model=0D
names with vendor neutral naming, to more directly correlate=0D
with defined x86-64 uarch ABI levels. We don't want to just=0D
invent CPUs with a completely arbitrary set of CPU features as=0D
history has shown that brings its own problems. eg a guest=0D
uses features A and B, but only does CPUID checks for existence=0D
of feature B, assuming that B implies A.=0D
=0D
The specification for x86-64 ABI levels uses x86-64-vNN naming=0D
but this clashes with QEMU's use of "vNN" for versioning. I=0D
felt it would be confusing to end up with CPU model names=0D
like  "x86-64-v1-v1". Thus I've used an "-abiNNN" suffix=0D
instead. Also note I have an "-abi1" suffix here for the=0D
baseline. Arguably we could just drop the suffix entirely for=0D
the baseline.=0D
=0D
A further note is that we could have used "qemu64" as the=0D
naming prefix, eg qemu64-abi2, qemu64-abi3, etc. Alot of=0D
people hold negative opinions of the qemu64 model in general=0D
though, so I felt a clean break with the past might be=0D
desirable, even though the x86-64-abi1 CPU  model is effectively=0D
identical to qemu64.=0D
=0D
Runnability of new models=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=0D
=0D
The goal of the x86-64-abiNNN CPU models is that they should be=0D
runnable on any physical host which supports the CPUIDs features=0D
for that uarch ABI level. It is hard to figure out what exact=0D
set of CPUID features we should report. The uarch ABI document=0D
only specifies the minimum expectation, but we can't define a=0D
CPU in QEMU using only the minimum set as that would omit=0D
countless important features.=0D
=0D
Thus to determine the feature set to use in x86-64-abiNNN CPU=0D
models, this series used a script (see patch 4) which did the=0D
following:=0D
=0D
  * Find list of current CPU models that satisfy ABI NN=0D
  * From this list, calculate the lowest common denominator (LCD)=0D
    of CPUID features=0D
  * From the LCD, find the existing CPU model that has the fewest=0D
    extra features over the LCD.=0D
  * Use that closest match, minus the extra features=0D
    to define x86-64-abiNN=0D
=0D
This approach works well for the baseline ABI, and level 2 ABI=0D
=0D
For ABI level 3 there is a bit of a larger divergance in feature=0D
sets, because the LCD between Intel and EPYC models is relatively=0D
large. We omit aes pcid erms invpcid tsc-deadline x2apic pclmulqdq=0D
=0D
For ABI level 4 the divergance is small. I believe this is a=0D
deceptive situation that arises because currently only Intel=0D
CPUs in QEMU are able to satisfy ABI level 4 currently. None=0D
of the EPYC CPUs defined in QEMU are able to satisfy it.=0D
=0D
I'm concerned that if future EPYC CPU generations are added to=0D
QEMU which *do* indeed satisfy x86-64 v4, then QEMU's x86-64-abi4=0D
CPUID may prove to be too greedy and thus be unable to run on=0D
the future CPUs. In theory we can address this through use of=0D
CPU versioning, but ideally we would not have to deal with that.=0D
=0D
Nested virt caveats=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0D
=0D
A further caveat is that none of these generic models define=0D
any VMX feature set. At the very least I believe this means=0D
that nested virt can't live migrate, but maybe this breaks=0D
ability to use nested virt entirely. I'm unclear what the=0D
best approach is to deal with this, that would let the user=0D
do both "-cpu x86-64-abi2,svm=3Don" and "-cpu x86-64-abi2,vmx=3Don"=0D
=0D
Side channel mitigation caveats=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0D
=0D
Finally none of the x86-64-abiNN models include any of the=0D
features related to CPU side channel mitigations. We can't=0D
add them without sacrificing the ability to run on some=0D
physical hardware that would otherwise satisfy the uarch=0D
ABI level.=0D
=0D
This makes me a little uneasy. One of the main downsides=0D
of using "qemu64" is that it leaves guests vulnerable to the=0D
side channel attacks. Introducing new general purpose CPUs=0D
that still have this flaw feels undesirable. I don't know=0D
whethe to prioritize safety, while sacrificing runability.=0D
=0D
Crypto accelerator caveats=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=0D
=0D
Similarly I'm not a huge fan of leaving out the "aes"=0D
instruction for accelerated crypto, as missing "aes" is=0D
also one of the key factors in making qemu64 a bad choice.=0D
=0D
If we include 'aes' in x86-64-abi2, then we loose support=0D
for Nehalem hosts.=0D
=0D
If we include 'aes' in x86-64-abi3 then we further loose=0D
support for Dhyana hosts (an EPYC derived CPU).=0D
=0D
Wrap up=0D
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0D
=0D
Overall this series shows some CPU models for QEMU that=0D
can map to each x86-64 ABI level, but I'm unsure whether=0D
it is wise to actually go forward with this idea given=0D
the various caveats.=0D
=0D
I think they'll mostly only be useful as a built-in default=0D
for machine types. If anyone is going to explicitly specify=0D
a CPU model they'll almost always be better off picking a=0D
vendor specific model or host passthrough. There can be=0D
cases where people have a mix of AMD and Intel bare metal=0D
machines they need portability across but this feel rare.=0D
=0D
Whatever else comes of this series, at least patch 1 should=0D
be useful, giving people an idea of what ABI levels each=0D
QEMU CPU can satisfy in the documentation.=0D
=0D
Changed in v3:=0D

 - Rebased to resolve conflicts with git master=0D

Changed in v2:=0D
=0D
 - Don't document any of the CPU aliases, since they vary per=0D
   machine type, only the concrete types.=0D
 - Formally add the script for re-generating the docs=0D
