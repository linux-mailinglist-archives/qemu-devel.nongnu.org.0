I am not quite sure what exactly you mean here. Do you mean to modify
the current virt
machine to be PCIE only after QEMU 7.1 or the new PCIE only machine
(with the versioning)
which will be the default machine in the future

If you intend to say the former, few issues with that approach.

1. virt machine is not well documented and already bloated. There is
no specification for virt machine as such.
Putting restrictions after a certain release will lead to confusion.
2. Do we support existing MMIO devices after that specific version or not ?
3. The user has to be aware of which version of virt machine it is
running in order to test specific features (i.e. flash, reset, wired
interrupts)
4. Based on the version of the virt machine, the command line options
will change. This may also be confusing.

On the other hand, the second approach will be much cleaner without
any baggage. The RISC-V eco-system is still maturing and this is the
right time
to start something fresh. Let's call the new machine virt-pcie for
now. Here are a few things that can be implemented for this machine.

1. It must support versioning and any changes to the machine code must
modify the version of the machine.
2. It must only support MSI based PCIe devices. No support for wired interr=
upts.
    The only allowed MMIO devices are
           -- mtimer/mtimecmp (there is no other option provided in ISA)
           -- reset/rtc device (If there is a way we can emulate these
two over PCIe, that would be great)
           -- flash
Beyond this, adding any other MMIO device must be strongly discouraged.
3. The virt-pcie machine must be well documented similar to a hardware
specification (including address range, restrictions and
implemented/allowed devices)
4. No dependence on virtio framework but must work with virtio-pcie backend=
.
5. Migration must be supported.
6. No command line option is required.
7. Any other ?

Once we have these policies in place, this can be the preferred virt
machine and the current virt machine can be phased out or continue to
co-exist
as a more flexible experimental platform.

Thoughts ?
