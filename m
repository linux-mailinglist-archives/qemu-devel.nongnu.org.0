I *want* to run them. Occasionally - when I have new patches that might
affect anything related to the block layer. But then I don't want to be
in the situation where I first have to debug multiple other problems
with the iotests first that are not related to my new patches.

Well, "rarely" is relative. They've been broken *completely* two times
in the 4.1 development time frame, and IIRC at least once in the 4.0
time frame.

Ok, sorry for that. I guess one part of my frustration was also that the
patches to enable the iotests during "make check" have been on the list
for weeks - or rather months - and I never ever got much feedback from
you or Kevin on them. If you told me right in the beginning about your
concerns, we would not be at this point now. Also partly my bad, I
guess, since I could have reached out to you on IRC to discuss it, but
at that point in time, I rather thought that you just don't really care.
Thus it's good to have some conversation now, helps a lot to understand
the different expectations. Maybe we can also have a discussion about
this at KVM forum, I think it's easier to clarify some points of view
verbally there instead of using mails.

Ok ... you're the maintainer, so if that's really the way you prefer, I
can send a patch to remove the iotests from "make check" again.

I disagree. First, the complete iotest failures that have been merged
during the 4.1 development time frame to the master branch would have
been prevented, I think, so it's certainly not that "they never fail".

Second, yes, the basic idea was to start with a small set of tests in
the auto group which was already working, and then to increase that set
over time, once other tests run more stable, too. But you know the
iotests better than me, if you think that most of them can hardly
brought into the right shape, then this was likely just wishful thinking
by me.

Since I'm not assigned to the block layer, I could only help
occasionally, so that's likely not enough for solving your frustration.
Thus I'll send a patch to remove the iotests from "make check" again.
