Peter, yes, it is definitely different. It has been a moving target lately.
May I suggest that we use a stable version of QEMU, and a stable version of
LTP, and create a skiplist for such stable configuration, include it in the
docs, explicitely noting used versions? We can continue doing that for each
QEMU release and whatever the latest LTP would be at the moment of that
QEMU release (maybe even keeping the previous skiplists - which could be
useful for debugging).

Aleksandar
