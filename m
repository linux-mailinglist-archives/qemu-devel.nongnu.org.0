Thank you for the detailed explanation! This is good information to have
on the ML archive.

I'm still surprised that we need to prohibit IDE specifically from
interacting with drives of this type, as I would have hoped that the
kernel driver beneath our feet would have managed the access for us, but
I guess that's not true?

(If it isn't, I worry what happens if we have a format layer between us
and the baremetal: if we write qcow2 to the block device instead of raw,
even if we advertise to the emulated guest that we're using a zoned
device, we might remap things in/outside of zones and that coordination
is lost, wouldn't it?)

Not that I really desire people to use IDE emulators with fancy new
disks, it just seemed like an unusual patch.

If Kevin and Paolo are on board with the design, it's not my place to
try to begin managing this, it just caught my eye because it touched
something as old as IDE.

Thanks,
