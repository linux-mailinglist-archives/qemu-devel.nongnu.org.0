This is implementing the host side of the net_failover concept
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/net_failover.html)

Changes since v1:
- add new QMP events,
   - one is send when the primary device is unplugged
   - one is send when VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY is not negotiated.
     This is needed because we hide the primary device until
     the feature bit is negotiated and then add it with
     qdev_add_device(). The event is for libvirt to be aware of that.
- patch 7/9: a new migration state, called wait-unplug.
  It is entered after SETUP and before ACTIVE. In this phase we check
  devices for pending guest unplug complete event.
  This patch still has a problem. It checks in a loop if there are still
  devices that are not unplugged by the guest. If the guest never
  returns it will run forever. How to terminate this loop? I thought
  about a timed wait semaphore or just spinning for a certain amount of t=
ime,
  but nothing seems good. Any ideas here?
- patch 2/9: When unplugging the primary devices, only do the guest part =
i.e.
  call hotplug_handler_unplug_request() which calls the pcie attention
  button code. The unrealize part is not done so the ressources of the
  device are not freed.  In case of migration failure we can re-plug the =
device to
  the guest with hotplug_handler_hotplug(). I tested migration failure an=
d
  a following second attempt to migrate that doesn't fail.
- add the primary device on the target VM, done in runstate change
  handler.
- fix error reporting (dgilbert)
- get rid of timer to add device after feature negotiation

The general idea is that we have a pair of devices, a vfio-pci and a
virtio-net device. Before migration the vfio device is unplugged and data
flows to the virtio-net device, on the target side another vfio-pci devic=
e
is plugged in to take over the data-path. In the guest the net_failover
module will pair net devices with the same MAC address.

* Patch 1 adds the infrastructure to hide the device for the qbus and qde=
v APIs

* Patch 2 In the second patch the virtio-net uses the API to defer adding=
 the vfio
  device until the VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY feature is acked. It also
  implements the migration handler to unplug the device from the guest an=
d
  re-plug in case of migration failure

* Patch 3 and 4 make sure that we can unplug the vfio-device before
  migration starts

* Patch 5 and 6 add new qmp events, one sends the device id of a device
  that was just requested to be unplugged from the guest and another one
  to let libvirt know if VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY was negotiated

* Patch 7 adds a new migration state that is entered while we wait for
  devices to be unplugged by guest OS

* Patch 8 sets a new flag for PCIDevice 'partially_hotplugged' which we
  use to skip the unrealize code path when doing a unplug of the primary
  device

* Patch 9 sets the pending_deleted_event before triggering the guest
  unplug request

Previous discussion:
  RFC v1 https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/989098/
  RFC v2 https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg606906.htm=
l
  v1: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-05/msg03968.html

To summarize concerns/feedback from previous discussion:
1.- guest OS can reject or worse _delay_ unplug by any amount of time.
  Migration might get stuck for unpredictable time with unclear reason.
  This approach combines two tricky things, hot/unplug and migration.
  -> We need to let libvirt know what's happening. Add new qmp events
     and a new migration state. When a primary device is (partially)
     unplugged (only from guest) we send a qmp event with the device id. =
When
     it is unplugged from the guest the DEVICE_DELETED event is sent.
     Migration will enter the wait-unplug state while waiting for the gue=
st
     os to unplug all primary devices and then move on with migration.
2. PCI devices are a precious ressource. The primary device should never
  be added to QEMU if it won't be used by guest instead of hiding it in
  QEMU.
  -> We only hotplug the device when the standby feature bit was
     negotiated. We save the device cmdline options until we need it for
     qdev_device_add()
     Hiding a device can be a useful concept to model. For example a
     pci device in a powered-off slot could be marked as hidden until the=
 slot is
     powered on (mst).
3. Management layer software should handle this. Open Stack already has
  components/code to handle unplug/replug VFIO devices and metadata to
  provide to the guest for detecting which devices should be paired.
  -> An approach that includes all software from firmware to
     higher-level management software wasn't tried in the last years. Thi=
s is
     an attempt to keep it simple and contained in QEMU as much as possib=
le.
     One of the problems that stopped management software and libvirt fro=
m
     implementing this idea is that it can't be sure that it's possible t=
o
     re-plug the primary device. By not freeing the devices resources in =
QEMU
     and only asking the guest OS to unplug it is possible to re-plug the
     device in case of a migration failure.
4. Hotplugging a device and then making it part of a failover setup is
   not possible
  -> addressed by extending qdev hotplug functions to check for hidden
     attribute, so e.g. device_add can be used to plug a device.


I have tested this with a mlx5 NIC and was able to migrate the VM with
above mentioned workarounds for open problems.

Command line example:

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 3072 -smp 3 \
        -machine q35,kernel-irqchip=3Dsplit -cpu host   \
        -k fr   \
        -serial stdio   \
        -net none \
        -qmp unix:/tmp/qmp.socket,server,nowait \
        -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:5555,server,nowait \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot0,multifunction=3Don,chassis=3D0,=
addr=3D0xa \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot1,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D1 \
        -device pcie-root-port,id=3Droot2,bus=3Dpcie.0,chassis=3D2 \
        -netdev tap,script=3D/root/bin/bridge.sh,downscript=3Dno,id=3Dhos=
tnet1,vhost=3Don \
        -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=3Dhostnet1,id=3Dnet1,mac=3D52:54:00=
:6f:55:cc,bus=3Droot2,failover=3Don \
	-device vfio-pci,host=3D5e:00.2,id=3Dhostdev0,bus=3Droot1,standby=3Dnet1=
 \
        /root/rhel-guest-image-8.0-1781.x86_64.qcow2

I'm grateful for any remarks or ideas!

Thanks!

Changes from RFCv2 to v1:
- work around circular dependency of commandline options. Just add
  failover=3Don to the virtio-net standby options and reference it from
  primary (vfio-pci) device with standby=3D<id>
- add patch 3/4 to allow migration of vfio-pci device when it is part of =
a
  failover pair, still disallow for all other devices
- add patch 4/4 to allow unplug of device during migrationm, make an
  exception for failover primary devices. I'd like feedback on how to
  solve this more elegant. I added a boolean to DeviceState, have it
  default to false for all devices except for primary devices.
- not tested yet with surprise removal
- I don't expect this to go in as it is, still needs more testing but
  I'd like to get feedback on above mentioned changes.
