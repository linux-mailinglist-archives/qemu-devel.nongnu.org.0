In qemu-system-FOO, the hash table can have only these entries:

* (OOB) One mapping @mon_iothread's thread leader to a QMP monitor, while
  executing a QMP command out-of-band.

* (QMP-CO) One mapping @qmp_dispatcher_co (a coroutine in the main
  thread) to a QMP monitor, while executing a QMP command in-band and in
  coroutine context.

* (QMP) One mapping the main thread's leader to a QMP monitor, while
  executing a QMP command in-band and out of coroutine context, in a
  bottom half.

* (HMP) One mapping the main thread's leader to an HMP monitor, while
  executing an HMP command out of coroutine context.

* (HMP-CO) One mapping a transient coroutine in the main thread to an
  HMP monitor, while executing an HMP command in coroutine context.

In-band execution is one command after the other.

Therefore, at most one monitor command can be executing in-band at any
time.

Therefore, the hash table has at most *two* entries: one (OOB), and one
of the other four.

Can you shoot any holes into my argument?

I suspect there's a simpler solution struggling to get out.  But this
solution works, so in it goes.  Should the simpler one succeed at
getting out, it can go in on top.  If not, I'll probably add even more
comments to remind myself of these facts.
