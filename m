Hi, everybody.

I am going to propose several ideas for QEMU participation in GSoC/Outr=
eachy in next few days. This is the first one. Please feel free to give=
 an honest feedback.

Yours,
Aleksandar



Measure and Analyze Performance of
QEMU User and System Mode Emulation


PLANNED ACTIVITIES

PART I: (user mode)

=C2=A0=C2=A0 a) select around a dozen test programs (resembling compone=
nts of SPEC benchmark, but must be open source, and preferably license =
compatible with QEMU); test programs should be distributed like this: 4=
-5 FPU CPU-intensive, 4-5 non-FPU CPU intensive, 1-2 I/O intensive;
=C2=A0=C2=A0 b) measure execution time and other performance data in us=
er mode across all platforms for ToT:
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - try to improve performance if th=
ere is an obvious bottleneck (but this is unlikely);
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - develop tests that will be prote=
ction against performance regressions in future.
=C2=A0=C2=A0 c) measure execution time in user-mode for selected platfo=
rms for all QEMU versions in last 5 years:
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - confirm performance improvements=
 and/or detect performance degradations.
=C2=A0=C2=A0 d) summarize all results in a comprehensive form, using al=
so graphics/data visualization.

PART II: (system mode)

=C2=A0=C2=A0 a) measure execution time and other performance data for b=
oot/shutdown cycle for selected machines for ToT:
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - try to improve performance if th=
ere is an obvious bottleneck;
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 - develop tests that will be prote=
ction against performance regressions in future.
=C2=A0=C2=A0 b) summarize all results in a comprehensive form.


DELIVERABLES

1) Each maintainer for target will be given a list of top 25 functions =
in terms of spent host time for each benchmark described in the previou=
s section. Additional information and observations will be also provide=
d, if the judgment is they are useful and relevant.

2) Each maintainer for machine (that has successful boot/shutdown cycle=
) will be given a list of top 25 functions in terms of spent host time =
during boot/shutdown cycle. Additional information and observations wil=
l be also provided, if the judgment is they are useful and relevant.

3) The community will be given all devised performance measurement meth=
ods in the form of easily reproducible step-by-step setup and execution=
 procedures.

(parts 1) and 2) will be, of course, published to everybody, maintainer=
s are simply singled out as main recipients and decision-makers on poss=
ible next action items)

Deliverable will be distributed over wide time interval (in other words=
, they will not be presented just at the end of project, but gradually =
during project execution).


Mentor: Aleksandar Markovic (myself) (but, I am perfectly fine if someb=
ody else wants to mentor the project, if interested)

Student: open


That would be all, feel free to ask for additional info and/or clarific=
ation.
