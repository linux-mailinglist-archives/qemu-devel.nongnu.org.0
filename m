I'll change the parameter to use a BDS instead of a file name in
this new interface.

Patch 3 uses this function as part of the core logic of this fix (do not
delete the file if the file already existed) inside block/cryptoc. This
is the reason it is exposed here. I assumed that we do not want a
public function inside file-posix.c (since there is none - everything
is done using the BD interfaces).

I think it would be sensible to simply this code as a static inside
crypto.c, since it's used twice there, and do the regular file check in
raw_co_delete_file using S_ISREG() directly - like it is already done
inside file-posix.c in other circunstances. Another alternative would
be a new bdrv_path_is_regular_file() interface but I don't think the
use I'm making here justifies this new interface as well.


Thanks,


DHB
