I just started to write some quick and dirty hacks to test use of this
infrastructure in libvirt. I have 2 quick observations for now:

We'd probably like a
'nodename:bitmapname' -> 'alias' mapping so that we can select which
bitmaps to migrate and where to migrate them to. The specific use case
is following:

Libvirt supports migration without shared storage (NFS/etc) where we
copy the disk images prior to the memory migration using qemu's NBD
server and the blockdev-mirror job. By default and the most simple way
which doesn't require users fudging with the disk images and copying
backing images themselves is that we flatten all the backing chain
during the copy ("sync":"full"). In this mode we'll need to do some
merging of the bitmaps prior to finalizing the copy.

It's not a problem to do it ourselves, but in the end we'll need to copy
only certain bitmaps which will be created temporarily on the source to
the destination where they'll be persisted.

For now (until I implement the use of the dirty-bitmap-populate blockjob
which I'm also doing in parallel with this kind of) when creating a
snapshot we create a new active bitmap in the overlay for every active
bitmap in the snapshotted image.

When flattening we'll then need to merge the appropriate ones. As said
it's not a problem to prepare all the bitmaps before but we then don't
need to migrate all of them.

By the way, that brings me to another question:

Is there any difference of handling of persistent and non-persistent
bitmaps? Specifically I'm curious what's the correct approach to do the
shared storage migration case when the source and destination image is
the same one. Should we also instruct to migrate the active ones? or are
they migrated by writing them to the image and reloading them?

qemu-5.0 deprecated a bunch of migrate-set- specific commands in favor
of migrate-set-parameters. Is it worth/necessary to add a new command
here?
