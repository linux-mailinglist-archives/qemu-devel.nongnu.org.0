Actually for an incremental backup we are creating a new bitmap which is
used for merging all the appropriate bitmaps for the expected backup
range. This is done also when only one bitmap would be selected this way
as there's no point in optimizing this algorithm.

This means we can name the new bitmap arbitrarily (if it doesn't clash
with existing bitmap) and since that name will be also exported it's the
same they request.
