Normally, converting a mandatory output value to optional is a 
back-compatibility risk (we could break apps that depended on it being 
present).  But if the only apps that depended on it being present are 
compiled on Linux, where the member will actually be present, I think 
that changing the schema to make it optional for non-Linux platforms 
won't be a back-compatibility nightmare (but we will have to be careful 
in our documentation).
