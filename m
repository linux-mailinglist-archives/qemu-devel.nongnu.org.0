On IRC, we decided that it's probably not worth shoe-horning this (and 
the rest of the series) into 5.0, given the experimental nature.  Still, 
I'll go ahead and review, so we can settle on things early in 5.1.

Of course, now that we're slipping this, you'll have to s/5.0/5.1/g over 
the remaining patches.  I won't point it out further.

Hiding/rejecting x- interfaces is probably the easiest of these, but I 
agree that leaving this open-ended to add further coverage (or even 
additional modes) is still reasonable.

For example, adding
'*experimental-input': 'CompatPolicyInput'
would make it easy to hard-code failure on attempt to use x-* commands.

You've had this in-tree for a while. I'll leave it up to you if you want 
to add 2020.

Ending with a comma is odd.  Is the Authors: snippet even necessary, or 
are we better off relying on git history (which tends to be more 
accurate anyway)?

Are we trying to use SPDX tags in more files?

We'll eventually want to drop (experimental), especially if we get all 
the rest of this into 5.1.

But for now this looks like a good start.
