I'll happily apply PEP 8 to Python code, but this is C. I don't think
PEP 8 applies very well to C code. (In fact, PEP 7 exists as a C style
guide, but we're not writing C code for the Python project here...)

The project style guide for C is defined in CODING_STYLE.rst. Missing
consistency with it is what I'm complaining about.

I also agree that consistency within one module or function is most
important, which is why I allow you to reformat my code. But I don't
think it means that local coding style rules shouldn't be documented,
especially if you can't just look at the code and see immediately how
it's supposed to be.

Ok, that's finally clear limits at least.

Any other rules from PEP 8 that you want to see applied to C code?

Would you mind documenting this somewhere?

As I said, I don't mind the exact number much. I do mind predictability,
though. (And ideally also consistency across the project because
otherwise I need to change my editor settings for individual files.)

So if you don't like 79 columns, give me any other number. But
please, do give me something specific I can work with. "illegibly wide"
is not something I can work with because it's highly subjective.
