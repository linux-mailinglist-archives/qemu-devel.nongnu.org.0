I don't think slirp is special in this regard. The benefit you're promoting
here applies to any dependancy we have, but I think the benefit is not big
enough to justify.

The use of submodules has imposed significant pain on QEMU developers over
the years, and as such I think our general goal should be to have zero git
submodules over the long term. Usage of submodules ought to be considered
a short term workaround only, with a clear criteria for removal. We should
continually introduce dependancies on newer & newer versions, as that means
we'll never have any opportunity to remove them and reduce the cost on
QEMU.

Regards,
Daniel
