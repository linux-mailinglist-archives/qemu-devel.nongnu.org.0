Public bug reported:

Description of problem:
Currently, when a iOS device is redirected to a macOS VM, it falls into a r=
eset-not-found loop.
Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
latest
How reproducible:
100%
Steps to Reproduce:


Connect an iOS device to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (I believe it is the same for a=
ny distro.)


Connect virt-manager/virt-viewer to a macOS VM through SPICE (I am using OS=
X 10.15 Catalina)


Attempt to redirect the iOS device (iPad in my case) to the VM through usb =
redirection.


Actual results:
For any odd number of attempt, the guest macOS will send a reset to the iOS=
 device which causes the host to reset the USB connection in the host side.=
 In the UI, it will be displayed as a successful connection for a few secon=
ds before it disconnects. After this, the iOS device will reconnect itself,=
 but via a different device name /dev/bus/usb/x/y+1.
For any even number of attempt, when I select the iOS device in the virt-ma=
nager/virt-viewer UI, the connection will not success and instead a LIBUSB_=
ERROR_NOT_FOUND error will be provided. Then the UI will reload and get the=
 new device name of the iOS device, falling into the behavior of the aforem=
entioned odd number of attempt.
Expected results:
The macOS detects the iOS device and connects to it happily.
Additional info:
It seems that this bug has been first identified as in https://bugs.freedes=
ktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D100149, for a Samsung Android device, which the =
developers of SPICE applied a hotfix in https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/spic=
e/usbredir/-/blob/master/usbredirhost/usbredirhost.c#L147. However, there w=
ere no settings available for users to fix it.
A similar bug that also consists of a macOS guest/iOS device pair, but inst=
ead of being usbredir, is usb-host, has been identified and patched in http=
s://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/ba4c735b4fc74e309ce4b2551d258e442ef513a5, w=
hich is further modified into https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blame/146aa0f104=
bb3bf88e43c4082a0bfc4bbda4fbd8/hw/usb/host-libusb.c#L1486. Following such p=
atch, I have attempted to apply such patch at host-side in https://github.c=
om/michaellee8/qemu/blob/master/hw/usb/redirect.c (not correctly formatted =
currently, pls ignore it atm), however I discovered that this is not enough=
 since it is also a SPICE issue, which resolves to virt-manager/virt-viewer.
This is probably a cross-project issue between qemu, spice (usbredir) and v=
irt-manager/virt-viewer, which would some effort to coordinate a solution. =
However a working solution for this problem would probably benefits a lot o=
f users whom relies on connecting a mobile device into a VM, for purposes l=
ike easier mobile development. Considering the report for the Samsung Andro=
id Device on a PC use case, such issue is probably cross-OS/cross-device.
