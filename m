If you are poking at guest memory when bus master is off, then most likely yes.

ATM the callback is the config write, you check
proxy->pci_dev.config[PCI_COMMAND] & PCI_COMMAND_MASTER
and if disabled invalidate the mapping.

virtio at least has code that pokes at
proxy->pci_dev.config[PCI_COMMAND] too, I'm quite
open to a function along the lines of
pci_is_bus_master_enabled()
that will do this.
