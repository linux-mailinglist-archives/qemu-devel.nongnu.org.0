I first checked the related known fixes from the old case that is linked.
Just in case if we might miss one in Ubuntu 20.04 that you are using.

This got upstream and is in:
$ git describe --contains ad7dc69aeb231
v5.0-rc8~1^2~2
That we'd clearly have in Focal being on 5.4

Other fixes related to the topic are in qemu 2.8

The following is from >=3D1.12.0-1 (was enabled by default before)
There is a small (for old qemu) and large binary (new qemu):

Note: if we are out of options we could try testing to set USE_SMM=3Dn
here, but lets check other details first.

But as already explained on the linked bug 1813165:
"If you're seeing "KVM internal error. Suberror: 1" it can be multiple thin=
gs, not necessarily the same bug."

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
