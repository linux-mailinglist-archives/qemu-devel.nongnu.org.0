The implicitly enabled extensions are mostly subset of its super 
extension, except zfinx (I think it's visible to user,

and we  can change it to check zdinx/zhinx{min} requires it). So 
enabling them when their super subset are enabled will

introduce no additional function to  the cpu. So it's just another 
internal implementation(C is replaced by Zca, Zcf, Zcd)

for SIFIVE_CPU without real function change (neither increase nor  
decrease).

Implicitly enabled extensions may introduce new problem for write_misa: 
C/V function cannot be disabled by it

(I have described before). However,  this is another problem unrelated 
to priv version.
