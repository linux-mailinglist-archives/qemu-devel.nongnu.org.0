Easy enough to add it, and it doesn't hurt.

Fixed.

Docstring updated to that text.

Oh, OK, that makes sense. The name "_nodes_for_ifcond" is already
taken, though, so I'll call it "_nodes_for_if_section".

Right. We also need to change some of the _nodes_for_whatever
functions that were sometimes returning just a single node
(eg "return section") to instead return a one-element list
("return [section]"), and make them return [] where they were
previously returning None. But this seems like a good change,
as then all these functions consistently return a list
(which might have 0, 1 or many elements).

We need to launder it into an ExtensionError, so
   qapierr = QAPISemError(info, "message")
   raise ExtensionError(str(qapierr))

but otherwise this works nicely, and you get:

Extension error:
In file included from
/home/petmay01/linaro/qemu-from-laptop/qemu/docs/../qapi/qapi-schema.json:72:
/home/petmay01/linaro/qemu-from-laptop/qemu/docs/../qapi/block.json:4:
section or subsection heading must be in its own doc comment block

(Or we could do the launder-QAPIError-into-ExtensionError
in run() by extending the scope of its try..except, as I think
you suggest below.)

Ah, yes, I'd forgotten that commit. So I can drop the bit of
code you disliked previously that insists on section headings
being in their own freeform block (handling "header line followed
by freeform text" is easy). That also incidentally means we're down
to only one parser-error in the qapidoc.py, which is the one that
catches mis-ordered section headings (eg using '=== header' when
you hadn't previously used '== header').

I'll take this option, I think.
