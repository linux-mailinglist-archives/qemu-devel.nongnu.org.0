I'll take another stab at this, but my feeling is that a '-no-' option
should be one that just turns off the default behavior, which is why I
wrote a long description of the default behavior. If you'd prefer the
description to be more terse, then I can certainly delete a bunch of
the text, but then I fear what this option disables wouldn't be clear
enough.
