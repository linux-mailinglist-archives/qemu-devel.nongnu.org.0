Well, we can actively poll ..

=2E. similarly to how we asked to be put on the reviewer list for the
deprecated.

We an use our test data which we gather from qemu periodically which
include the QMP schema to extract the list of deprecated features and
store them in git. If we bump the test data and a new deprecated entry
appears the developers will need to asses whether it's used or not and
take the appropriate action.

The appropriate action may also include deriving a capability
information from it and use it to alter libvirt's behaviour which would
then be queried at startup of the VM, but mostly we want to use the new
approach which will replace given deprecated feature as soon as it's
available.
