- Defined MIGRATION region type and sub-type.
- Used 3 bits to define VFIO device states.
    Bit 0 => _RUNNING
    Bit 1 => _SAVING
    Bit 2 => _RESUMING
    Combination of these bits defines VFIO device's state during migration
    _STOPPED => All bits 0 indicates VFIO device stopped.
    _RUNNING => Normal VFIO device running state.
    _SAVING | _RUNNING => vCPUs are running, VFIO device is running but start
                          saving state of device i.e. pre-copy state
    _SAVING  => vCPUs are stoppped, VFIO device should be stopped, and
                          save device state,i.e. stop-n-copy state
    _RESUMING => VFIO device resuming state.
    _SAVING | _RESUMING => Invalid state if _SAVING and _RESUMING bits are set
- Defined vfio_device_migration_info structure which will be placed at 0th
  offset of migration region to get/set VFIO device related information.
  Defined members of structure and usage on read/write access:
    * device_state: (read/write)
        To convey VFIO device state to be transitioned to. Only 3 bits are used
        as of now.
    * pending bytes: (read only)
        To get pending bytes yet to be migrated for VFIO device.
    * data_offset: (read only)
        To get data offset in migration from where data exist during _SAVING
        and from where data should be written by user space application during
         _RESUMING state
    * data_size: (read/write)
        To get and set size of data copied in migration region during _SAVING
        and _RESUMING state.
    * start_pfn, page_size, total_pfns: (write only)
        To get bitmap of dirty pages from vendor driver from given
        start address for total_pfns.
    * copied_pfns: (read only)
        To get number of pfns bitmap copied in migration region.
        Vendor driver should copy the bitmap with bits set only for
        pages to be marked dirty in migration region. Vendor driver
        should return 0 if there are 0 pages dirty in requested
        range. Vendor driver should return -1 to mark all pages in the section
        as dirty

Migration region looks like:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
|vfio_device_migration_info|    data section                      |
|                          |     ///////////////////////////////  |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 ^                              ^                              ^
 offset 0-trapped part        data_offset                 data_size

Data section is always followed by vfio_device_migration_info
structure in the region, so data_offset will always be none-0.
Offset from where data is copied is decided by kernel driver, data
section can be trapped or mapped depending on how kernel driver
defines data section. If mmapped, then data_offset should be page
aligned, where as initial section which contain
vfio_device_migration_info structure might not end at offset which
is page aligned.
