I just posted a patch to rectify that.

I'm not sure if a shell can open a Unix socket as a server.  The shell=20
_does_ have the 'exec' builtin, such that you can manipulate the=20
environment in shell and then use exec to guarantee the qemu-nbd process=20
has the same pid as the shell process that just manipulated the=20
environment; but it doesn't help unless you can also pass in the Unix=20
socket pre-bound, and I'm not aware of command line tools that make that=20
easy (maybe nc can do something like it, but then you have to wonder if=20
nc is adding yet another layer of bounce-buffering).  But in other=20
languages (C, Python, ...) you create a Unix socket, call bind() on it,=20
then call fork().  In the parent process, you then close the just-bound=20
fd, and call connect() on the socket - the connect will block until the=20
child process uses the socket, but you are guaranteed that it won't fail=20
because the server side is already bound.  In the child process, you use=20
dup2() to move the fd to 3 and clear O_CLOEXEC, manipulate the=20
environment to set LISTEN_PID to the current process id and LISTEN_FDS=20
to 1, then exec.  The child process then has the correct id to realize=20
that it has been handed a pre-bound socket, and skips any code that it=20
would normally do to create the socket and bind it.

Note that setting LISTEN_PID in the child process after a fork() from a=20
multi-threaded parent is _extremely_ difficult to do correctly (setenv()=20
is not async-signal-safe, and anything that is not async-signal-safe can=20
cause deadlock if invoked between fork() and exec() if the parent=20
process was multi-threaded) - so it may even be easier to do a=20
double-exec() - the first exec is to a shim to get rid of the=20
async-signal-safe restrictions, and can then set LISTEN_PID without=20
issues, and the second exec to the actual target.  But I don't know of=20
any such shim designed for common use.

That said, socket activation isn't a necessity to use, just a=20
convenience.  I don't care if the regression test uses socket=20
activation, as long as it works at testing nbd reconnect.
