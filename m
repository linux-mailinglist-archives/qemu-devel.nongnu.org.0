It is the same pattern.  However, one of the two synchronized variables
is a counter rather than just a flag.

Got it.

I'd also prefer the one with just fences, because we only really control
one side of the synchronization primitive (ctx_notify_me in my litmus
test) and I don't like the idea of forcing seq-cst MO on the other side
(bh_scheduled).  The performance issue that I mentioned is that x86
doesn't have relaxed fetch and add, so you'd have a redundant fence like
this:

	lock	xaddl $2, mem1
	mfence
	...
	movl	mem1, %r8

(Gory QEMU details however allow us to use relaxed load and store here,
because there's only one writer).

This helps a lot already; I'll work on a documentation and code patch.
Thanks very much.

  qemu-img hangs on rcu_call_ready_event logic in Aarch64 when

Bug description:
  Command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 ./disk01.qcow2 ./output.qcow2

  Hangs indefinitely approximately 30% of the runs.

  ----

  Workaround:

  qemu-img convert -m 1 -f qcow2 -O qcow2 ./disk01.qcow2 ./output.qcow2

  Run "qemu-img convert" with "a single coroutine" to avoid this issue.

  <HUNG w/ 3 threads in the stack trace showed before>
  """

  All the tasks left are blocked in a system call, so no task left to call
  qemu_futex_wake() to unblock thread #2 (in futex()), which would unblock
  thread #1 (doing poll() in a pipe with thread #2).

  Those 7 threads exit before disk conversion is complete (sometimes in
  the beginning, sometimes at the end).

  [ Original Description ]

  On the HiSilicon D06 system - a 96 core NUMA arm64 box - qemu-img
  frequently hangs (~50% of the time) with this command:

  qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O qcow2 /tmp/cloudimg /tmp/cloudimg2

  Where "cloudimg" is a standard qcow2 Ubuntu cloud image. This
  qcow2->qcow2 conversion happens to be something uvtool does every time
  it fetches images.

  Once hung, attaching gdb gives the following backtrace:

  (gdb) bt
