  Hi,

Yes.

Hmm.  Given that the transition effort will probably take a while
I think it makes sense to allow mixing config file and cmd line
switches, if it is only for testing the config file parsing and
processing.  Maybe have a (temporary) -x-config for that?

We already have qapi schema for -blockdev + -display + -audiodev +
-chardev, creating a configuration struct which supports these
shouldn't be that much effort.  Then move over QemuOpts one by one.

The most tricky part here probably is -device support.

Yep.  Zero reason to keep that once everything transitioned to qapi.

Well, we can support multiple formats, much like openshift accepts both
json and yaml.  json is pretty much there already, so we could start
with that and add yaml later on.  Possibly even the ini-style syntax
accepted by -readconfig today, although I'm not sure there is much
benefit in that.

Once config file support is complete enough we should be able to offload
backward compatibility command line parsing to some script which
transforms the cli into a config file.  Which is probably better than
trying to add -writeconfig to qemu as we don't have to do the string
processing in C then.

cheers,
  Gerd
