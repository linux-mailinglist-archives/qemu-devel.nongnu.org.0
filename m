First, a usage question: would you rather that 'qemu-img convert 
--bitmaps' silently succeeds even when the image being converted has no 
bitmaps, or would you rather that it fails loudly when there are no 
bitmaps to be copied over?  As implemented in this patch series, patch 8 
currently silently succeeds.  But in order to make patch 7 and 8 
consistent with one another, I need to know which behavior is easier to 
use: failing convert if the source lacks bitmaps (and thus measure would 
suppress the bitmaps:0 output), or treating lack of bitmaps as nothing 
additional to copy and thereby succeeding (and thus measure should 
output bitmaps:0 to show that no additional space is needed because 
nothing else will be copied, successfully).

More concretely, suppose down the road that we add the ability to copy 
internal snapshots (not that you want to mix internal and external 
snapshots, but that such information already exists and therefore can be 
used as an example).  Which is easier:

$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2
required size: 8716288
fully allocated size: 8716288
bitmaps size: 1024
internal snapshot size: 2048

where you now have to add three numbers prior to creating dest.qcow2 and 
calling:

$ qemu-img convert image.qcow2 -f dest.qcow2 --bitmaps --snapshots

or using:

$ qemu-img measure --bitmaps --snapshots -f qcow2 image.qcow2
required size: 8719360
fully allocated size: 8719360

where you then call:

$ qemu-img convert image.qcow2 -f dest.qcow2 --bitmaps --snapshots

with a single size that matches the same arguments you pass to qemu-img 
convert?  What about failure cases?  What happens when qemu-img doesn't 
understand --snapshots but does understand --bitmaps?  Do you have to 
try a series of up to three calls to find how much information is supported:

$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2 --bitmaps --snapshots
error: unknown argument
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2 --bitmaps
error: unknown argument
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2
data given, now you know that neither --bitmaps nor --snapshots will work

or is it nicer to issue just one measure without options, getting 
separate output lines, and seeing which output lines exist to know which 
convert options are supported, at the minor expense of having to add 
values yourself?

And then back to my question: should 'measure --bitmaps' fail if there 
are no bitmaps to be measured, or silently succeed and not change the 
output size?

Why do you have to check 'qemu-img info' first?  If measure reports 
bitmaps, then you know bitmaps can be copied; if it doesn't, then you 
can check info as a fallback path to compute size yourself - but 
computing the size yourself doesn't help unless you also have fallbacks 
to copy the bitmaps via QMP commands, because that qemu-img will also 
lack 'qemu-img convert --bitmaps' or 'qemu-img bitmaps' to do it via 
qemu-img.

Or, that could be a CLI-only feature: the QMP interface _always_ reports 
bitmaps separately, but if 'qemu-img measure --bitmaps' is used, the CLI 
then adds that value in on your behalf after the QMP command but before 
printing to the end user.

If we only touch it up in the CLI, then we would have two forms of CLI 
output:

$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2
required size: 8716288
fully allocated size: 8716288
bitmaps size: 1024
$ qemu-img measure -f qcow2 image.qcow2 --bitmaps
required size: 8717312
fully allocated size: 8717312

I'm leaning towards making v4 try a CLI-only 'measure --bitmaps', to see 
if I can speed the discussion along with concrete patches for comparison.
