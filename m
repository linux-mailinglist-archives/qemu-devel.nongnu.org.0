Well, I don=E2=80=99t know whether it=E2=80=99s necessary to reproduce th=
e exact message
with all the data it contains.  As I said, I think users can and will
investigate the exact root of the problem with tools outside of qemu.
(Such as openssh=E2=80=99s ssh itself.)

For example:
http://api.libssh.org/master/group__libssh__session.html#gacbc5d04fe66bee=
e863a0c61a93fdf765
> SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_CHANGED: The server key has changed. Either you are und=

This doesn=E2=80=99t require any specific formatting or data to be given =
to the
user.  All it requires is =E2=80=9Cto warn the user about a possible atta=
ck=E2=80=9D.
That can be as simple as appending =E2=80=9CThis may be due to a
man-in-the-middle attack=E2=80=9D to the error message.

God forbid no.  I was just making an example of =E2=80=9CHere is a warnin=
g about
a possible attack=E2=80=9D.  I fully agree with Dan (and probably you) th=
at this
is completely unsuitable to qemu=E2=80=99s interface.

Sorry if that came across in another way.

Again, I=E2=80=99m only being half-serious.  I tried to bring that point =
across
every time I mention this thing.

If you just say =E2=80=9CLet=E2=80=99s leave it as it is, I don=E2=80=99t=
 see any benefit=E2=80=9D,
sure, OK, I=E2=80=99ll accept that.

But so far you didn=E2=80=99t say that, so I kept pestering on.


I would have never mentioned this topic if I hadn=E2=80=99t read the
specification while reviewing your patch last year and noticed that it
explicitly states =E2=80=9CYou HAVE to warn the user about a possible att=
ack.=E2=80=9D

I never said =E2=80=9CPlease emit the exact message openssh=E2=80=99s ssh=
=E2=80=9D emits.  Well,
I never meant to say that.  Maybe I accidentally did.  Sorry again.

My whole point is: The specification requires libssh users to emit
*some* warning.  If we want to adhere to the specification, we have to
do that.  Just one sentence is sufficient.

If we don=E2=80=99t want to adhere to the specification, sure, let=E2=80=99=
s go.  But
you=E2=80=99ll have to explicitly say that.  I=E2=80=99m not the patch au=
thor, I=E2=80=99m but a
humble reviewer, and as such I=E2=80=99ll point out all flaws I see.  You=
 have
to give justifications, not me. O:-)
