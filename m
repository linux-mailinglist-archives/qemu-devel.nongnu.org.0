LOPAPR mentions that a single resource/node can have multiple associativity
arrays. The idea is to contemplate the situations where the node has
more than one connection with the board.

I say "somewhat" because, right after mentioning that, the spec also says that
the OS should consider that the distance between two nodes must always be
the shortest one of all available arrays. I'll copy/paste the except here
(end of section 15.2, "Numa Resource Associativity":

-----

The reason that the “ibm,associativity” property may contain multiple associativity
lists is that a resource may be multiply connected into the platform. This resource
then has a different associativity characteristics relative to its multiple connections.
To determine the associativity between any two resources, the OS scans down the two
resources associativity lists in all pair wise combinations counting how many domains
are the same until the first domain where the two list do not agree. The highest such
count is the associativity between the two resources.
