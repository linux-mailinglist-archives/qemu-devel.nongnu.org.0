Yes it looks like it;  it's that the migration state machine hits
COMPLETED that then _causes_ the runstate transitition to POSTMIGRATE.

static void migration_iteration_finish(MigrationState *s)
{
    /* If we enabled cpu throttling for auto-converge, turn it off. */
    cpu_throttle_stop();

    qemu_mutex_lock_iothread();
    switch (s->state) {
    case MIGRATION_STATUS_COMPLETED:
        migration_calculate_complete(s);
        runstate_set(RUN_STATE_POSTMIGRATE);
        break;

then there are a bunch of error cases where if it landed in
FAILED/CANCELLED etc then we either restart the VM or also go to
POSTMIGRATE.

Given that the migration state machine is driving the runstate state
machine I think it currently makes sense internally;  (although I don't
think it's documented to be in that order or tested to be, which we
might want to fix).

Looking at 234 and 262, it looks like you're calling wait_migration on
both the source and dest; I don't think the dest will see the
POSTMIGRATE.  Also note that depending what you're trying to do, with
postcopy you'll be running on the destination before you see COMPLETED.

Waiting for the destination to leave 'inmigrate' state is probably
the best strategy; then wait for the source to be in postmigrate.
You can cause early exits if you see transitions to 'FAILED' - but
actually the destination will likely quit in that case; so it should
be much rarer for you to hit a timeout on a failed migration.
