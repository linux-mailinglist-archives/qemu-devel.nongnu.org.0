If apps are actually looking at the shutdown reasons, it is
trivial for the app themselves to log any unexpected reasons.

They should in fact do that regardless, because if someone
re-compiles the app against a new version of the QEMU Go API,
there may be new ShutdownCause's defined that their codes does
not handle. There's no compile time check from Go side that
their code has handled all ShutdownCause values, since there's
no struct enum type in Go.  This again pushes me to towards
the view that the enums should just remain as strings, the use
of integers gives no functional benefit AFAICT, given the lack
of a real enum type in Go.


With regards,
Daniel
