Public bug reported:

>From my testing it seems that QEMU built against musl libc crashes on
pthread_cancel cancel calls - if the binary is also built with musl
libc.

Minimal sample:

#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void* threadfunc(void* ignored) {
	while (1) {
		pause();
	}
	return NULL;
}
int main() {
	pthread_t thread;
	pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &threadfunc, NULL);
	sleep(1);
	pthread_cancel(thread);
	printf("OK, alive\n");
}

In an Alpine Linux aarch64 chroot (on an x86_64 host) the binary will
just output RT33 and has exit code 161.

Using qemu-aarch64 on an x86_64 host results in the output (fish shell)
  fish: =E2=80=9Cqemu-aarch64-static ./musl-stat=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D terminat=
ed by signal Unknown (Unknown)
or (bash)
  Real-time signal 2

and exit code 164.

It doesn't matter whether the binary is linked dynamically or static.
You can see my test results in the following table:

|                      | QEMU glibc | QEMU musl |
|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| binary glibc dynamic | =E2=9C=93          | =E2=9C=93         |
| binary glibc static  | =E2=9C=93          | =E2=9C=93         |
| binary musl dynamic  | =E2=9C=93          | =E2=9C=97         |
| binary musl static   | =E2=9C=93          | =E2=9C=97         |

Both QEMU builds are v5.1.0 (glibc v2.32 / musl v1.2.1)

I've uploaded all my compile and test commands (plus a script to
conveniently run them all) to https://github.com/z3ntu/qemu-
pthread_cancel . It also includes the built binaries if needed. The test
script output can be found at https://github.com/z3ntu/qemu-
pthread_cancel/blob/master/results.txt
