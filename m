It means xics and xive are available, guest gets to choose.

Uh.. yes, that would make sense, actually.  However
max-compat-cpu=3Dpower8 without an explicit ic-mode=3Dxive or ic-mode=3Ddual
should act as ic-mode=3Dxics.  The difference here is that it's an
explicitly user specified constraint, rather than a host implied
constraint.

Correct.

Well, TBH, the main use of kernel-irqchip=3Doff is for debugging and testin=
g.
