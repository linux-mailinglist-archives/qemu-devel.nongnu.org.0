The current way we generate a makefile from ninja output is not our
long term desired approach. Eventually the intent is that we should
be able to use  meson + ninja exclusively.

The ninja -> make convertor we currently rely on introduces maint
problems of its own. So I don't think we want to introduce a
ninja -> Xcode converter, as that is still effectively giving us
1 + 1/2 different build systems, so is a new maint burden.

Ideally any xcode setup would just invoke whatever our standard
build tools are IMHO, so it has zero possibility of introducing
new build problems.

Daniel
