The idea with -blockdev is that you have control over every single layer
in the block device tree and manage everything explicitly. This is
mainly useful for management applications, but of course also provides
more control to human users where necessary, at the cost of being less
convenient than -drive.

-snapshot is pretty much the opposite: It's a high-level convenience
option where you basically tell QEMU that you don't care about the
details, but you just want to get some temporary overlay.

So the expected way to achieve the same functionality with -blockdev is
that you create a temporary qcow2 overlay file that has your real image
as its backing file (this is what -snapshot really does) and then open
that explicitly.

As you correctly concluded, this is something that libvirt should
probably implement.
