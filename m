It does have a meaning: compute a bunch of dictionaries and throw them
away.  Its useless as a program, but it's not meaningless.

True.  RFC 4626: "JSON is a subset of JavaScript, but it is a safe
subset that excludes assignment and invocation."[*]

An analogous subset of Python is possible, but has not been formally
defined as far as I know.

The pain of tweaking the parser is likely dwarved several times over by
the pain of the flag day.

To write a converter, you first have to understand the doc comment
language.  It's a bit of a mess, because it was fitted to existing
conventions to reduce churn.

Peter Maydell has patches to generate rST instead of Texinfo.  They
affect the doc comment language.  I expect to merge them for 5.2.

Yes.


[*] Unfortunately, this has become a statement of intent, not a
description of reality, due to JSON design accidents.
