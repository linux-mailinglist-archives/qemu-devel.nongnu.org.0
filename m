Move commands query-cpu-definitions, query-cpu-model-baseline,
query-cpu-model-comparison, and query-cpu-model-expansion with their
types from target.json to machine-target.json.  Also move types
CpuModelInfo, CpuModelExpansionType, and CpuModelCompareResult from
misc.json there.  Add machine-target.json to MAINTAINERS section
"Machine core".
