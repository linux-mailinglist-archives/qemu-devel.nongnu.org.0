That bit worries me because I think I agree it's SKU dependent and has
been for a long time (on Intel at least) and we don't even have CPU
models for all Intel devices. (My laptop for example is a Kaby Lake, 39
bits physical).  Maybe it works on the more modern ones where we have
'Icelake-Client' and 'Icelake-Server'.
