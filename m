The standard solution for this is configuring the guest device with
werror=3Dstop,rerror=3Dstop so that the error is not delivered to the gue=
st,
but the VM is stopped. When you run 'cont', the request is then retried.

Letting requests hang without stopping the VM risks the guest running
into timeouts and deciding that its disk is broken.

As you say your "hang" and retry logic sits in the block layer, what do
you do when you encounter a bdrv_drain() request?

Were you aware of werror/rerror? Before we add another mechanism, we
need to be sure how the features compare, that the new mechanism
provides a significant advantage and that we keep code duplication as
low as possible.
