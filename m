Right. Pragmatically, I think exports are very like to support writable,
but probably rather unlikely to support growable. So I do think there
would be a point for making writable part of the common base, but not
growable.

Not for the command itself, so I think we're free to change it later. It
might make a difference for introspection, though, not sure. Markus?

Having it in the base might allow us to remove some duplication in the
code. Probably not much, though, so not too important.

The NBD integration, yes. I already added the BlockExport type to my
patches, too, but I expect you would beat me to it. I'm not currently
planning to write a block-export-add because it doesn't add anything new
for the storage daemon, so FuseExport and the command this is your part.
The type currently only exists for --export.
