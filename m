Ok that's good.

Makes sense.

So in general, it sounds like breadth of test coverage is fairly important
for the CFI jobs, at least if we're exercising different areas of
functionality.  So I think we do need to be testing more than just one
architecture target.

The CFI protection is something I'd say is relevant to virtualization
use cases, not to emulation use cases

   https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/system/security.html

IOW, the targets that are important to test are the ones where KVM
is available.

So that's  s390x, ppc, x86, mips, and arm.

I think we can probably ignore mips as that's fairly niche.
We can also reasonably limit ourselves to only test the 64-bit
variants of the target, on the basis that 32-bit is increasingly
legacy/niche too.

So that gives us  ppc64le, x86_64, aarch64 and s390x as the
targets we should get CI coverage for CFI.

Regards,
Daniel
