That's why I'm trying as hard as possible to get the block-export-add
interface perfect in its 5.2 release; if we agree that allowing qemu to
expose more than one bitmap is beneficial (and I argue that it is), then
the new interface MUST support that from the get-go, and not something
where we release it with 5.2 having 'bitmap' and 6.0 adding 'bitmaps'.

The deprecated interface is nbd-server-add; for _that_ interface, the
'bitmap' parameter will continue to work until nbd-server-add is removed
in 6.1 (so you have all of 5.2 and 6.0 to switch from nbd-server-add to
block-export-add).

What this patch does, then, is alter the deprecation from merely
changing the command from nbd-server-add to block-export-add with all
parameter names remaining the same, to instead changing both the command
name and the 'bitmap'=>'bitmaps' parameter.  But I agree that libvirt
wants to do an all-or-none conversion: there is no reason for libvirt to
use block-export-add until 5.2 is actually released, at which point we
have locked in the new interface; and this patch is a demonstration that
we are still debating about a tweak to that interface before it becomes
locked in.

I can respin this to NOT add 'bitmaps' to the legacy 'nbd-server-add',
if you think that would be better.  It is more complex in the QAPI code,
but not too much more difficulty in the glue code; and the glue code all
goes away in 6.1 when the deprecation cycle ends.

Fair enough. v6 coming up later today.
