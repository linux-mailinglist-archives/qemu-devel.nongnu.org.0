My personal opinion would be, to use vm name for the connection (will cover
use case of distinguishing between VMs)
and using audiodev derived name for stream names, which will at least
partially cover the use case of having more that one guestn's soundcard,
and assigning each to different host sound card dynamically,
that is  using pavucontrol, which is what I wanted to do in first place.
This is also should be the easiest to do probably.
