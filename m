Are there any hooks that would allow me to manipulate the MIPS TLB so that =
I can just split the mappings within the board file? I'm trying to avoid mo=
difying the CPU source if possible. This type of solution sounds like it wo=
uld be similar to the last one Peter described in the linked post (which de=
scribes exactly my problem. Thank you for finding that!)

Unfortunately QEMU doesn't model microarchitecture, thus no cache is modell=
ed, meaning KSEG1 is the same as KSEG0.

Peter Maydell had the similar problem you describe last year:
