Maybe we can use subdirectory like we do for the TCG tests (Aleksandar
maintains tests/tcg/mips/). We should try to keep contribution upstream,
so good idea/pattern can be reused by others.

What I'd like to have with those tests is, at least:

1/ we don't need to run all the tests (but there is a set of 'quick'
tests we can run on daily basis)

2/ maintainers can run their default tests easily (using a combination
of Avocado tags)

3/ if a developer working on the PCI subsystem has to modify the MIPS
subsystem (for example), he should be able to run the MIPS tests before
sending his series.
