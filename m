It does. Polishing everything for the perfect experience could be a bit
more work, but just querying the schema and providing some
autocompletion from it sounds easy enough.

I don't think it would be that hard, actually.

If you have a -qmp-shell option that takes a chardev and defaults to vc,
you've solved the part with both stdio and Ctrl-Alt-2. Now all you need
to do is launch the Python child process, pass it a pair of pipes for
communication and forward everything between the pipes and the chardev.

(That's the theory anyway.)
