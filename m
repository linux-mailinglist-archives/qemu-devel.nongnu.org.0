Good discussion point...

In my opening use case for this POC I'm generically trying to create an
unrecoverable media error for a specific sector.  For each of the
different device types it's different on how that error is conveyed and
the associated data in transfer.

If we return EIO on a read_aio, that must be translated into transport
specific error right?  I really need to try out blkdebug and see what is
seen in the guest.  Maybe I'm upside down on the layering too :-)

I think VMs are a great way to test all different error paths, just not
those specific to storage so if we could make this generic that would be
great.


I also elaborated about this a bit in one of my other responses, but
I'll reiterate here a bit too.  If we could design a suitable callback
interface utilizing qapi I think we could move the state machine/logic
out of QEMU all together.  So that the test code could contain this
logic which would allow all types of behavior that we haven't even
thought of to exist outside of QEMU and not require changes to QEMU to
exploit.
