Is anyone working on adding a sifive-u74 core to the list of supported
CPU types? I was looking at full emulation of the Unmatched but at the
moment the best we have is sifive-u54 and I think that misses at least
two CSRs the sifive-u74 has.

Does anyone have plans to add the sifive-u74, and if not, would a plan
to add gradual support for it like adding CSRs 0x7c1 and 0x7c2 so we
can run an Unmatched U-boot SPL against it.

If not, is there a definitive U54->U74 set of public differnces around
we could use to start from? I'd like to be able to run a full Unmatched
image using qemu at some point to add to the current real-board testing
we're doing.

(I have a basic addition of the type and the two CSRs as a couple of
patches if that would help as a start)
