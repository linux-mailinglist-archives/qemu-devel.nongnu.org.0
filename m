The switch feels rather silly to me.  If you take the trouble to put
your host in FIPS mode, requiring -enable-fips to make QEMU to actually
honor it makes no sense.  If you don't, QEMU's -enable-fips has no
effect.

I may well misremember things (it's been years), but I vaguely recall
-enable-fips being a lame compromise between "this ought to be upstream"
and "FIPS is stupid, and I want nothing of it".

I'd expect the SASL libraries to honor FIPS mode by themselves.  But
best ask someone who actually knows how FIPS mode is supposed to work.
