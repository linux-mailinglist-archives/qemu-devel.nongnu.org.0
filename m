You’re right. WIPEONFORK is more like a single-bit per use. If it’s 
something system wide then a counter is better.

This reminds me on key/IV usage limits for AES encryption, where the 
same birthday bounds apply, and even though 256-bits would be better, we 
routinely make 128-bit birthday bounds work for massively scalable 
systems.

Neat.
