I think we should change mailman settings to *NOT* convert HTML to
plain text. It is pretty easy to setup mail clients to do this
conversion when viewing instead, which will avoid the DMARC problems.

eg with mutt you can add

  auto_view text/html
  alternative_order text/plain text/html

and in $HOME/.mailcap something like

  text/html; elinks -dump -localhost 1 -no-connect 1 -default-mime-type text/html %s; needsterminal; copiousoutput;
