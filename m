I acknowledge this is an issue, and have thought about two possible
ways to solve it:

 1) Downloading/caching/checking all the test assets in a job "pre-tests"
    plugin.  This would involve/require:

   - https://trello.com/c/WPd4FrIy/1479-add-support-to-specify-assets-in-test-docstring
   - https://trello.com/c/CKP7YS6G/1481-on-cache-check-for-asset-fetcher

 2) Report the test phase (say, setUp()) to the test runner, which
    would allow the runner to:

   - Not take that time into account for the test (similar to
     https://github.com/avocado-framework/avocado/pull/3076)
   - Retry the setUp a number of times (if the test opts in or doesn't
     opt out)

I'm very much interested in your opinion so we can evolve the idea into
implementation.

Thanks!
