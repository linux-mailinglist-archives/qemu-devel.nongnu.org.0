For virtio-gpu as it is today, it's not clear to me that they're
equivalent. As I read it, the virtio-gpu spec makes a distinction
between the guest memory and the host resource. If virtio-gpu is
communicating with non-virtio devices, then obviously you'd just be
working with guest memory. But if it's communicating with another
virtio device, then there are potentially distinct guest and host
buffers that could be used. The spec shouldn't leave any room for
ambiguity as to how this distinction is handled.

Looking at the spec again, it seems like there's some more work that
would need to be done before this would be possible. But the use case
I was thinking of would be to export a fence from virtio-gpu and share
it with a virtio decoder, to set up a decode pipeline that doesn't
need to go back into the guest for synchronization. I'm fine dropping
this point for now, though, and revisiting it as a separate proposal.
