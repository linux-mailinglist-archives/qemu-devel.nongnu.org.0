The main difficilty, as I see this now, would be establishing a test bed.
This should be possible using one or two USB flash drives (if one doesn't
want to mess with own hard drives and partitions). After that, having
dm-enabled devices available, writing unit test should be straightforward.

I don't have a particular prefference towards dm ioctls, they just look to
me simple enough to be a good and gentle starting point for a beginner.

Giving a student a hard case at the beginning could be quite discouraging
for him/her, and probably even counterproductive for the project as a whole=
.

Again, this is just my opinion, I don't have the ambition to impose such
details. After all, this was and is just a proposal.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is currently 2500+ ioctls defined in Linux kernel.=
 QEMU linux-user<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; currently supports only several hundred. There is a cons=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; expanding ioctl support in QEMU. Users use Linux-user mo=
de in variety of<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; setups (for example, building and testing tools and appl=
ications under<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; chroot environment), and, on a regular basis, efforts by=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are made to fill in missing support. However, these effo=

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PART I:<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0a) Add strace support for outputing ioctl I=
