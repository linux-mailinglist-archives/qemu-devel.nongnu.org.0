Thanks!  Would it make sense to add the yank stuff to a new QAPI module
yank.json instead of misc.jaon, so the new MAINTAINERS stanza can cover
it?

Works for me.  Advice on when to use it rather than migrate_cancel would
be nice, though.

I see.

DeviceNotFound doesn't really fit, but none of the other error classes
is any better.

I think the line

      # Returns: nothing.

in the QAPI schema (quoted above) should be expanded to something like


      # Returns: - Nothing on success
                 - If the YankInstance doesn't exist, DeviceNotFound
