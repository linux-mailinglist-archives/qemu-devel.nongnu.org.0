This device (being part of an integrated southbridge chip) has no PCI IRQ=
=20
at all, stop talking about it, that only may apply to CMD646. Once you=20
accept this it may be easier to actually get to a solution. The via-ide=20
either drives the legacy interrupts in legacy mode and on pegasos2 always=
,=20
regardless of mode. Or in true native mode it drives one ISA interrupt fo=
r=20
both channels selected by PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE config reg. This is clear=20
from the VT8231 datasheet and my test with guests.

How does the device code know if there's anything connected to the gpio i=
t=20
defines? I don't see your proposal would be simpler or even easier to=20
understand (aka cleaner) than what I've implemented. You'll need to=20
explain a bit more but I think the real solution is to model VT82C686B an=
d=20
VT8231 and not parts of it in qdev. We don't want to model the inside of=20
these chips.
