You can post multiple patches on the list, but I wouldn't claim to
support v0.1 until there is a v0.1 to claim.

For actual changes being merged we can only claim to support v0.1 when
there is a v0.1 and it is supported. We can push the patches in
stages, for example we can merge some tidy ups before merging the full
support, but we can't allow a user to enable support (or advertise it)
until it's fully supported.
