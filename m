Yes, i understood it and this abort() message was fixed by the previous
patch. But since we try new postphone approach this patch isn't working
and we need to get the device state somehow:
  - vhost-user disconnect => device not started

Well it is the question we talk about with you, i'm also not sure. I can
only summarize some of the statements i used:
  - device state: not started -> is okay for migration
  - device state: vhost-user disconnect, this is the same as "not
    started" -> is okay for migration
  - at least my internal migration tests passed
So my idea for the fix here is smth like:
Add device callback, for instance vhost_dev_started() which will
return device state. And for the vhost-user device (or at least
vhost-user-blk) device this callback will consider the connected field
and return true or false.
As a result vhost_migration_log() will check device state at the start
of the routine and before return.
But if the disconnect state isn't okay for migration, then we should
return an error.
