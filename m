I would certainly like to see us eventually remove
checkpatch.pl because of the various downsides it has.

The caveat is that I've not actually looked in any detail
at what things checkpatch.pl actually checks for. Without
looking my guess-timate is that we could probably replace
90% of it without much trouble. Perhaps we'll just decide
some of the checkjs in checkpatch aren't worth the burden
of maintaining its usage.

We could possibly come up with a way to put a magic comment
on the end of a line (eg '// style:ignore' ), and have it applied
automatically as an exclusion. A magic comment the line before
is hard though, given that we're aiming to match things linewise
for speed.

Sure, I don't mind.

ok
