SDEI is for ARM "Software Delegated Exception Interface". AS ARM64 doesn'=
t have
native non-maskable interrupt (NMI), we rely on higher privileged (larger
exception level) software to change the execution flow of lower privilege=
d
(smaller exception level) software when certain events occur, to emulate =
NMI
mechanism, and SDEI is the standard interfaces between the two levels of
privileged software. It is based on SMC/HVC calls.

The higher privileged software implements an SDEI dispatcher to handle SD=
EI
related SMC/HVC calls and trigger SDEI events; the lower privileged softw=
are
implements an SDEI client to request SDEI services and handle SDEI events=
.

Core interfaces provided by SDEI include:

1. interrupt bind: client can request to bind an interrupt to an SDEI eve=
nt, so
the interrupt will be a non-maskable event and the event number will be r=
eturned
to the caller. Only PPI and SPI can be bound to SDEI events.

2. register: client can request to register a handler to an SDEI event, s=
o
dispatcher will change PC of lower privileged software to this handler wh=
en
certain event occurs.

3. complete: client notifies dispatcher that it has completed the event
handling, so dispatcher will restore the context of guest when it is
interrupted.=20

In virtualization situation, guest OS is the lower privileged software an=
d
hypervisor is the higher one.

KVM is supposed to pass SMC/HVC calls to qemu, and qemu will emulate an S=
DEI
dispatcher to serve the SDEI requests and trigger the events. If an inter=
rupt is
requested to be bound to an event, qemu should not inject the interrupt t=
o guest
any more; instead, it should save the context of VCPU and change the PC t=
o event
handler which is registered by guest, and then return to guest.

To make the conversion of interrupt to SDEI event transparent to other mo=
dules
in qemu, we used qemu_irq and qemu_irq_intercept_in() to override the def=
ault
irq handler with SDEI event trigger. I saw qemu_irq_intercept_in() should=
 be
only used in qemu MST, but it seemed fit to override interrupt injection =
with
event trigger after guest requests to bind interrupt to SDEI event.=20

This patchset is trying to implement the whole SDEI framework in qemu wit=
h KVM
enabled, including all SDEI v1.0 interfaces, as well as event trigger con=
duit
from other qemu devices after interrupt binding.=20

Key points:
- We propose to only support kvm enabled arm64 virtual machines, for
  non-kvm VMs can emulate EL3 and have Trusted Firmware run on it,
  which has a builtin SDEI dispatcher.
- New kvm capability KVM_CAP_FORWARD_HYPERCALL is added to probe if
  kvm supports forwarding hypercalls, and the capability should be
  enabled explicitly.
- We make the dispatcher as a logical device, to save the states
  during migration or save/restore operation; only one instance is
  allowed in one VM.
- We use qemu_irq as the bridge for other qemu modules to switch from
  irq injection to SDEI event trigger after VM binds the interrupt to
  SDEI event. We use qemu_irq_intercept_in() to override qemu_irq
  handler with SDEI event trigger, and a new interface
  qemu_irq_remove_intercept() is added to restore the handler to
  default one (i.e. ARM GIC).

More details are in the commit message of each patch.

Basic tests are done by emulating a watchdog timer and triggering SDEI
event in every 10s.

Please focus on the interfaces and framework first. We can refine the cod=
e for
several rounds after the big things have been determined.

Any comment or suggestion is welcome.

Thanks,

HG
