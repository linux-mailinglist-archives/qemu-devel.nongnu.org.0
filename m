I agree it shouldn't be a gating issue for this patch series, but I'd=20
hate to see this discussion thread die off.

I'm still pretty interested in hearing whether anyone has any good ideas=20
for how to conclusively determine whether a given L1 VM has created a=20
nested L2 or not when the host is running an older Kernel that doesn't=20
support KVM_CAP_NESTED_STATE. That would be a very useful capability,=20
especially for CSP use cases. If anyone has any suggestions about where=20
to look, I don't mind spending some time digging into it and possibly=20
testing out a few ideas. Again, separate from this particular patch=20
series. So far I've been drawing a blank after Liran pointed out that=20
corner case problems associated with env->cr[4] & CR4_VMXE_MASK.

Thanks,
-Maran
