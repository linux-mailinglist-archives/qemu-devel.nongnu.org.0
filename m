The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  test-char not concurrent with unix socket

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  'make check-unit' might fail when running multiple tests in parallel.

  Apparently occurred on OSX CI:
  https://travis-ci.org/github/philmd/qemu/jobs/662357430

  Guess is same unix path used:

  static SocketAddress unixaddr =3D {
      .type =3D SOCKET_ADDRESS_TYPE_UNIX,
      .u.q_unix.path =3D (char *)"test-char.sock",
  };

  Note, other tests in this file use g_dir_make_tmp().
