Thanks for pulling up the handling by other architectures.
I think I agree that we should change the arm default (ie
we should just call this a bug fix, since the old behaviour
seems unhelpful generally and is more random accident than
a deliberate choice), with a switch provided just in case
anybody had something depending on the old behaviour.
