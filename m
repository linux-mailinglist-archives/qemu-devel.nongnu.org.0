Looks like adding/removing maintainers is done by first getting the project=
's=20
current json data, e.g.:

	https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/api/1.0/projects/14/

and then HTTP putting the (entire) modified json data with updated=20
"maintainers" field:

	PUT /api/1.0/projects/14/ HTTP/1.1
	Host: patchwork.ozlabs.org
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
		<json-data-here>
	}

or by just sending the updated "maintainers" json field with HTTP "PATCH"=20
command instead:

	PATCH /api/1.0/projects/14/ HTTP/1.1
	Host: patchwork.ozlabs.org
	Content-Type: application/json

	{
		"maintainers": ...
	}

As documented here:
https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/
[page 90, 92]

As far as I can see, this is currently not implemented in the client. So=20
that's manual, raw HTTP handling. No word in the docs though whether it's=20
sufficient being a project maintainer for doing that, or if you even need t=
o=20
have a patchwork admin account.

And unfortunately patchwork does not seem to have a concept of submaintaine=
rs,=20
so it seems to be all-or-nothing.

Best regards,
Christian Schoenebeck
