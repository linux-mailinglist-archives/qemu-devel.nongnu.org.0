I think the (implicitly made) requirement is not that all node-names are
kept the same, but only the node-names of those nodes for which
migration transfers some state.

It seems to me that bitmap migration is the first case of putting
something in the migration stream that isn't related to a frontend, but
to the backend, so the usual device hierarchy to address information
doesn't work here. And it seems the implications of this weren't really
considered sufficiently, resulting in the design problem we're
discussing now.

What we need to transfer is dirty bitmaps, which can be attached to any
node in the block graph. If we accept that the way to transfer this is
the migration stream, we need a way to tell which bitmap belongs to
which node. Matching node-name is the obvious answer, just like a
matching device tree hierarchy is used for frontends.

If we don't want to use the migration stream for backends, we would need
to find another way to transfer the bitmaps. I would welcome removing
backend data from the migration stream, but if this includes
non-persistent bitmaps, I don't see what the alternative could be.

You don't want to transfer bitmaps of nodes that you're going to drop.
I'm not an expert for these bitmaps, but I think this just means you
would have to disable any bitmaps on the backing files to be dropped on
the source host before you migrate.

Same thing, you don't want to transfer a bitmap for a node that
disappears.

Yes, we need a good and ideally future-proof rule of which node-names
need to stay the same. Currently it's only bitmaps, but might we get
another feature later where we want to transfer more backend data?

A map feels painful for the average user (and for the QEMU
implementation), even if it looks convenient for libvirt. If anything,
I'd make it optional and default to 1:1 mappings for anything that isn't
explicitly mapped.
