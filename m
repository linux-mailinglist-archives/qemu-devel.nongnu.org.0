Sorry for the delay,I was busy doing my job the last two weeks.

I use XFS V5 on both main host (5.3.7-arch1-2-ARCH) and backup host
(5.3.5-arch1-1-ARCH).

It seems I ran in the first bug that has been fixed upstream.
With git master (git clone at 18.10.) I could not reproduce the failure on =
my backup host.
I installed an RedHat 7.6 VM as always and the VM works without any errors.=
 The only thing I noticed was, the first boot after installation lasts long=
er as with qemu 4.0.0.

After this I checked the archlinux repositories an found in AUR the qemu-gi=
t package. I removed the official qemu packages from my main host and insta=
lled this (qemu-git 8:v4.1.0.r1699.gf9bec78137-1).
The behavior is the same as on the backup host, the VM installation works w=
ithout any errors as well as additional tasks (i. e. complete the basic ins=
tallation to an full desktop installation).
The last days I used the main hosts with this package for my daily work. At=
 the end of the day I checked the filesystems from the used existing, or ne=
w created VMs and didn't found any errors.

May be for archlinux user who needs the 4.1.0 qemu version the qemu-git
package from AUR is a possible workaround.

Title:
  qemu 4.1.0 - Corrupt guest filesystem after new vm install

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  When I install a new vm with qemu 4.1.0 all the guest filesystems are
  corrupt. The first boot from the install dvd iso is ok and the
  installer work fine. But the guest system hangs after the installer
  finishes and I reboot the guest. I can see the grub boot menue but the
  system cannot load the initramfs.

  Testet with:
  - RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.5, 7.6 and 7.7 (RedHat uses xfs for the /boot=
 and / partition)
  Guided install with the graphical installer, no lvm selected.
  - Debian Stable/Buster (Debian uses ext4 for / and /home partition)
  Guidet install with the graphical installer and default options.

  Used commandline to create the vm disk image:
  qemu-img create -f qcow2 /volumes/disk2-part2/vmdisks/vmtest10-1.qcow2 20G

  Used qemu commandline for vm installation:
  #!/bin/sh
  # vmtest10 Installation
  #
  /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64  -cpu SandyBridge-IBRS \
      -soundhw hda \

  With qemu 4.0.0 it works fine without any errors.
