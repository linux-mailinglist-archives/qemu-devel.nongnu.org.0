I'm suggesting to make ACPI hotplug on q35 opt-in,
becasue it's only Windows guests that doesn't work well with unplug.
Linux guests seems to be just fine with native hotplug.

My hunch is that should not be affected (but I will not bet on it).
ACPI hotplug just changes route hotplug event is delivered, and unplug
happens via ACPI as well. That works around drivers offlining/onlining
devices in rapid succession during native unplug (that's quite crude
justification).

So I'd like reasons to be well documented, including what ideas were
tried to fix or workaround those issues (beside ACPI one), so the next
time we look at it we don't have to start from ground up.

My take on it that, Windows always exposes unplug icon, and lets VM users
to unplug PCI devices. Notably, user is able to click away the only NIC
VM was configured with.

Unfortunatly the 'feature' can't be fixed on guest side, that's why
hypervisors implement such hack to disable ACPI hotplug. Which I guess
is backed by demand from users deploying Windows virtual desktops.

PS:
I'd made PCI hotplug opt-in, since not everyone needs it.
But that ship sailed long ago.
