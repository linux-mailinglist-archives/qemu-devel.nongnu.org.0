Looking at other enums defined in QEMU, it doesn't seem that constant 
names are CamelCase. Only the enum type name.
E.g. PVSCSIRegOffset, BiosAtaTranslation and etc.

The person who is expected to manipulate this property is quite advance 
to begin with...
The process described above is quite simple for such person.

Figuring out an enum value from definition is trivial. If you wish, I 
can change those to #define to make it more clear but error-prone.

That's not the reason.

It's not. It exactly lists all the various possible values. In contrast 
to directing the reader to a link (which may be broken in the future),
to figure out from there what should be the values. That seems more 
annoying to me as a reader.

Why not just define the entire enum then?...

This approach seems quite common for all device emulation code.
E.g. BTSTAT_HATIMEOUT in HostBusAdapterStatus, 
PVSCSI_REG_OFFSET_LAST_STS_3 in PVSCSIRegOffset, VMXNET3_CMD_UPDATE_IML 
in vmxnet3.h and etc.

Giving new names to existing terminology that can be matched against 
existing guest code which interface with your device emulation is what 
requires guesswork.
Using names matching the guest code driver is what doesn't require 
guesswork and is more intuitive to understand.

Let's agree that I will fix coding convention issue (VMX_Type -> 
VMXType) and link to open-vm-tools but remain with the enum.
And see what other maintainers have to see about this on v2.
