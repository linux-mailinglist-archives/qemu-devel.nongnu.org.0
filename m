I would *expect* the test to pass when run natively on power8 hardware.  Did it
not fail when run via qemu?  If not, then we didn't really choose the argument
sets that are affected by double rounding.

I would expect the inputs that Paul used in the original report to be
candidates.  Otherwise, we should grab some from the glibc fma test case(s).

The implicit bit is there: 0x1.xxx.  The representation is always normalized;
you write denormal numbers by using an exponent that would require denormalization.
