To document wrappers as simple as ssi_realize_and_unref(), pointing to
the wrapped function should suffice.  When more elaborate documentation
is wanted, it's probably wanted for the wrapped function.

Since you felt a need for a more elaborate ssi_realize_and_unref() doc
comment, you should probably propose a patch for
qdev_realize_and_unref()'s doc comment :)
