I am not fully convinced that the automatic mode is needed.  Especially
the ->data field.  I *fear* it being abused for other cases.

There is a pre_load() function for the VMState that creates this.  it
can be used to initualize the field value, no?  That way the data part
is not needed.  I think this will make the code less complex, what do
you think?

I am wondering if for this, it is better to add two VMSTATE (at least at
the macro level).  SIMPLE_TREE, and TREE, or whataver oyou want to call
it.  But I haven't fully looked into it.

The other general "consideration" that I have is that there is neither
of:
- marker between elements
- number of elements
- total size/size of elements.

That makes completelly impractical to "walk" the migration stream
without understanding exactyl what is there.  (Now, to be fair, there
are other parts of qemu that are like that.  PCI cames to mind.)

Really nice to have the tests.  Thanks.

This is the bit that I don't really like :p

My understanding is that if you do this on the pre_load() function, you
don't need this at all.

Ok.  there is a marker O:-)

But it is magic to know if it is a simple or complex key.

This can be simplified while we are at it.

If we get out of sync, for any reason, we have no way to recover.  The
only way to recover is that we don't get a "false" in this position.


Later, Juan.
