Just be consistent and store (user input) raw values for both fields
(i.e. B/s PS/s) and post-process them later to uint16_t.

No disagreement here,

but I suggest to move verification and base calculation from 09/11
into a separate patch (right after this one) and doing it at
numa_complete_configuration() time.
To store calculated base you can add a common_base field to
sub-table structure (HMAT_LB_Info) and use it when building ACPI
table without extra calculations.
