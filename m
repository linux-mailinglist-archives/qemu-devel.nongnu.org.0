Oh, cool, if we split that into an Aspeed part and a VM protocol part,
it's basically what I had in mind. Are you planning to submit that, or
would it be OK if we base our work on it?

Right. Perhaps the next step should be an out-of-process flash protocol?

Cool.

Interesting. Will it be too slow to run the server and BMC in separate
processes?

We might actually be more interested in going the other way and move
more things out of process, as we start to tackle larger, more complex
systems.

It sounds great to have the option to simulate multiple architectures
in the same process, and getting rid of single-arch assumptions seems
like a nice cleanup. However, I'm hoping we'll still support
multi-process system emulation (and the MultiProcessQEMU work seems to
be moving in that direction as well).

> Anyhow, the IPMI documentation you provided is good to have.

If you like, I can split off patch 1-2 (or just 2) and post them
separately while we work on the BMC-side device emulation. If we
decide to keep patch 1 and the block diagrams, we probably need to do
something better for the font path.

Thanks,

Havard
