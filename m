Presumably a normal, persistent bitmap.

Written out to the backing file and removed from memory, because we've
reopened rw->ro; this is because of the migration "safety" clause where
we simply drop these bitmaps.

...Ah, and then we don't actually open them readonly again; that entire
stanza in reopen_ro never fires off at all because the bitmaps are
already gone.

When we reopen the base as rw as you note, we skipped bitmaps for which
we had no in-memory bitmap for -- because the readonly logic was really
expecting to have these in-memory.

I should probably say that for the sake of migration correctness, the
way we flush things to disk and remove it from memory on write is really
bothersome to keep correct. The migration logic is so particular that it
keeps causing issues elsewhere, of which this is another symptom.

Yikes, right.

Yikes; because it was consistent on flush and we skipped it on load,
it's not marked as IN_USE and we are free to load it up again.

Good writeup, thank you.

Yes! I like this change.

OK, so we allow rw --> rw without trying to be fussy about it. That
seems fine to me.

I take it this is the change that moved the invocation logic into
bdrv_reopen_multiple instead of bdrv_reopen_commit; also notably we no
longer check the transition edge which is much simpler.

oh, I see why you're doing it there now...

OK, so this has been moved up into the main body of the loop because we
cannot trust it to run in bdrv_reopen_commit because of the order in
which the nodes are reopened might leave us unable to write to our child
nodes to issue the IN_USE flag.

I have kept out of these discussions in the past; is there a general
solution that allows us to sort the block DAG leaf-up to avoid this
scenario?

Anyway, since the block graph organization isn't my problem I will say
that I think this is fine by me; but I'm not the one to impress here.

Certainly the new code is simpler here, which is good.

Hm, I think you're right, but it does make me really uncomfortable that
we lose the ability to report errors back up the stack. I guess we
already always did ignore them, so this is no worse, but I don't like
the idea of adding new error_report_err calls if we can help it.

I guess we can't help it, though.

This is supposed to be a reopen but we've found a bitmap we didn't load,
and it's IN_USE. Should we make any attempt to load it as an
inconsistent bitmap so the user can know about it?

If we're here, it means we DID reopen the image rw, so we ought to have
exclusive ownership of this file; the IN_USE flag here signals an
inconsistency, no?

I don't understand lines 2-3 of this comment. As far as I can tell:

- We might be seeing a legitimately corrupt bitmap. It's fine to mark it
as rw, because we can't write to it anyway. (It was marked inconsistent
on open.)
- We might be seeing a bitmap that's already properly rw. this call is
effectively a no-op.

Is that right? If that's true, I'd just simply say:

"This is either an inconsistent bitmap or we are reopening rw -> rw. It
is safe to mark it as not read only in either case."

What's the "or we just didn't save bitmap for some buggy reason" you are
alluding to?

In this case, we find a valid bitmap we expected to have a readonly copy
of in memory, but didn't. We attempt to load it.

And we mark it as inconsistent because we're not sure how we missed it
earlier. OK.

And in this case, we find the bitmap but it's not marked readonly for
some reason.

Why set it readonly again?

And just in case, we mark it inconsistent. (It's my impression that any
such write would have failed earlier, but maybe not.)

This one is weirder. We have an inconsistent bitmap but it's not IN_USE;
so we set it readonly again? Why?

Oh, all those bitmaps we just set readonly we're going to mark as not
readonly again?

I genuinely don't know: is it legitimate to check your child's write

And then here at the end the bulk of the work: we re-write the header if
necessary back out to disk to mark everything as IN_USE.

It seems strange that you are trying to maintain the invariant that we
won't set readonly to false if we fail, because this function "cannot fai=
l."

I just don't know; for how much error checking this function is doing
now, it seems wrong to be behind an interface that cannot fail and will
actually do different things to the bitmaps depending on what it sees
with no return code to help the caller understand the cases.

It even has a bit at the end where it tries to print in uppercase to
manually scare a user into taking action, which says to me that there is
a deeper problem we need to be able to address without intervention from
the user.

That said, the patch does seem correct otherwise; and it does fix a
nasty bug which lets us use bitmaps with snapshots. I want this in for
4.1 if I can help it. I will talk to Kevin and Max and see if there's
some opinion here.

Thanks!

While we're here, I might touch up the comment.

For safety, the BdrvDirtyBitmap can be dropped after storing.
We may be here in two cases, both via qcow2_inactivate:
1. bdrv_close: It's correct to remove bitmaps on close.
2. migration: This implies we are migrating without the
   'dirty-bitmaps' capability, because bitmap->migration was unset.
   If needed, these bitmaps will be reloaded on invalidation.

I just wanted to clarify these points:

- The new boolean obviously means we don't /always/ drop them
- qcow2_inactivate is the only caller that instructs us to drop them
- both cases in the comment are through qcow2_inactivate.

you can take any or none of my wording suggestions as you feel is
appropriate.
