Test unmodified real-world binaries, know to work in the field.

Test can be added by users without having to be a TCG developer, see
https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg626608.html:

  class LoadBFLT(LinuxUserTest):
      def test_stm32(self):
          rootfs_url =3D ('https://elinux.org/images/5/51/'
                        'Stm32_mini_rootfs.cpio.bz2')
          rootfs_path_bz2 =3D self.fetch_asset(rootfs_url, ...)
          busybox_path =3D self.workdir + "/bin/busybox"

          res =3D self.run("%s %s" % (busybox_path, cmd))
          ver =3D 'BusyBox v1.24.0.git (2015-02-03 22:17:13 CET) ...'
          self.assertIn(ver, res.stdout_text)

          cmd =3D 'uname -a'
          res =3D self.run("%s %s" % (busybox_path, cmd))
          unm =3D 'armv7l GNU/Linux'
          self.assertIn(unm, res.stdout_text)

This is a fairly trivial test, cheap (no need to cross-build), yet it
still covers quite some QEMU code.

What you describe is a different and complementary test set. Craft tests
and build them with QEMU.

Title:
  [Feature request] acceptance test class to run user-mode binaries

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Currently the acceptance test framework only target system-mode emulation.
  It would be useful to test user-mode too.
