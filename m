this is already mentioned earlier:

this is also already documented:

I'd suggest to move rationale to step 6 description.
something like this:
  "expected binary updates should be a separate patch from
   the code that introduces changes to ACPI tables. It lets
   maintainer to drop and regenerate binary updates in case
   of merge conflicts"
