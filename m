Hi! Seems like you're using the QEMU from your distro, so should this be
a bug report against Ubuntu's QEMU instead? Otherwise, can you please
try again with the latest upstream version of QEMU (currently an RC of
v5.2)? You certainly also need to provide more information, e.g. what
kind of error message do you see, how often did you try (maybe it's just
an intermittent problem and it sometimes also works without rebooting
the host), etc.

Title:
  Host OS Reboot Required, for Guest kext to Load (Fully)

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  Finding this one a bit odd, but I am loading a driver (kext) in a
  macOS guest ... and it works, on the first VM (domain) startup after a
  full / clean host OS boot (or reboot). However, if I even reboot the
  guest OS, then the driver load fails =3D> can be "corrected" by a full
  host OS reboot (which seems very extreme).

  Is this a known issue, and/or is there a workaround?

  FYI, running,
  QEMU emulator version 5.0.0 (Debian 1:5.0-5ubuntu9.1)
  Copyright (c) 2003-2020 Fabrice Bellard and the QEMU Project developers

  This is for a macOS guest, on a Linux host.

  Thanks!
