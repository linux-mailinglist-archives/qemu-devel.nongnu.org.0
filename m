I think we should make sure that updating syscall.tbl does not get
forgotten if we do a headers update... have the update script print out
a message? I'm not sure if we want to automate updating the syscall
table, as we want manual inspection for it.

Maybe have the update script moan about syscall.tbl if unistd.h is
changed? Should be a good enough heuristic.

That said, I'll probably queue a headers update on the s390-next branch
right now (against current Linus master), unless someone complains --
maybe take the syscall.tbl from that state of the kernel tree as well?
