It's not only that.  We're close to a point where we'll need to
determine whether "make check-acceptance" will work as a generic
enough default for most user on their environments and most CI
systems.

As an example, this job ran 5 fairly slow tests (which I'm preparing
to send):

  https://travis-ci.org/clebergnu/qemu/jobs/535967210#L3518

Those are justifiably slow, given the fact that they boot a full
Fedora 30 system using TCG.  The job has a cumulative execution time
of ~39 minutes.  That leaves only 11 minutes to spare on the Travis
CI environment.  If they all exercised close to their 600s allowances
(timeout), the Travis job would have failed.=20

Having said that, if a CI failure is supposed to be a major breakage,
which I believe it's the right mind set and a worthy goal, we should
limit the amount of tests we run so that their *maximum* execution
time does not exceed the maximum job time limit.

Basically, what I meant is that we could attempt something like:

 * Job "Brave"
  - 50 tests, each with 60 seconds timeout =3D 50 min max
  - 60 tests, each with 1 second timeout  =3D 1 min max

If Job "Brave" is run on a system such as Travis, it *can* fail,
because it can go over the maximum Travis CI job limit of 50 min.
We could set an Avocado job timeout of say, 48 minutes, and tell
Avocado to mark the tests it wasn't able to spawn as "SKIPPED",
and do not report an overall error condition.

But, if we want to be more conservative (which I now realize is
the best mindset for this situation), we should stick to something
like:

 * Job "Coward"
  - 47 tests, each with 60 seconds timeout =3D 47 min max
  - 60 tests, each with 1 second timeout  =3D 1 min max

So my proposal is that we should:

 * Give ample timeouts to test (at least 2x their average
   run time on Travis CI)

 * Define the standard job (make check-acceptance) as a set
   of tests that can run under the Travis CI job (discounted
   the average QEMU build time)

This means that:

 * We'd tag some tests as "not-default", filtering them out
   of "make check-acceptance"

 * Supposing a developer is using a machine as least as powerful
   as the Travis CI environment, and assuming a build time of
   10 minutes, his "make check-acceptance" maximum execution
   time would be in the order of ~39 minutes.

I can work on adding the missing Avocado features, such as
the ability to list/count the maximum job time for the given test
selection. This should help us to maintain sound CI jobs, and good
user experience.

And finally, I'm sorry that I did overthink this... but I know
that the time for hard choices are coming fast.

Thanks,
- Cleber.
