Is it truly a bug in libvirt?  Making QEMU behave differently
when getting exactly the same input sounds like a bad idea, even
if we documented that at the QAPI documentation.

My suggestion is to instead drop the comment below from the QAPI
documentation.  New properties shouldn't become mandatory.

I will insist we make it consistent for all properties, but I
don't want this discussion to hold the bug fix.  So I'll do this:

I will submit a new patch that makes only die-id optional, and CC
qemu-stable.

After that, i will submit this patch again, and we can discuss
whether we should make all properties optional.
