Or put differently, extents of the qcow2 file are always allocated a 
contiguous cluster at a time (so using larger clusters reduces 
fragmentation), but because we can now defer to the backing image a 
sub-cluster at a time, we have less I/O to perform the first time the 
guest touches a subcluster.  The two different return values thus tell 
us when we need to do a cluster allocation vs. just an in-place 
overwrite or a sub-cluster COW.

Nicer than my initial thoughts on getting rid of the bit-wise loop.  And 
uses 64-bit math to produce a 32-bit answer, so there are no edge cases 
where overflow could misbehave even though the intermediate steps may 
require 33 bits.  Works as long as X <= Y (should that be mentioned in 
the contract?)

Also works (you do the math in the low 33 bits before shifting), again 
if X <= Y.

More complicated than merely writing 0xffffffffULL and 
(0xffffffffULL<<32), but the compiler will constant-fold it to the same 
value, and it elegantly expresses the intent.  I like it.
