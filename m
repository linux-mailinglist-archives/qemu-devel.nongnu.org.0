No strong feelings. The result of renaming the files would be a bit
nicer than what we have today, but renaming always comes with a cost
when working with the version history later. Hard to tell if it's a net
gain or loss in the end.

Myself, I would probably pick the lazy way and stick with "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it", but I'm not objecting to a change either.
