Yes, it is a CPU feature, and yes you can select the exception vector
prefix with the MSR[IP] bit which should be set by a hardware reset. The
initial value seems wrong in qemu but that seems to fixed by the
machine-specific initialization. The 'none' machine, however, just uses
generic code and does not do anything PPC-specific. This means that

 - the MSR and probably other registers, too, are not initialized to what t=
he hardware
   documentation specifies as reset values.
 - the time-base is not initialized at all (and this leads to a segfault wh=
en you start the
   ppc 'none' machine)
 - probably other things are not properly initialized. I wonder, e.g., abou=
t the MMU...

It seems that all registers are simply initialized to zero. Then, there see=
ms to be a 'reset' function which initializes the registers to the proper r=
eset values (well - sort of bug 812398 reports that HID0 is not properly in=
itialized by some CPU flavours). However, that reset function
is not executed by the 'none' machine initialization....

Title:
  7400,7410,7450 cpus vector have wrong exception prefix at reset

Status in QEMU:
  Triaged

Bug description:
  I have a proprietary ROM implementing system calls that are executed
  via the 'SC' instruction.

  I use qemu-0.14.1,

  qemu-system-ppc -M prep -cpu $CPU -bios my_bios -kernel my_kernel

  That works fine on a 604 (CPU=3D0x00040103) - but does not on an emulated=
 7400 (CPU=3D0x000c0209) or 7450 (CPU=3D0x80000201). I found that the emula=
tor jumps to 0x00000c00 instead of 0xfff00c00.
  Probably this is due to a wrong setting in target-ppc/translate_init.c:

  init_excp_604() correctly sets env->hreset_vector=3D0xfff00000UL;

  but

  init_excp_7400() says env->hreset_vector=3D0x00000000UL;

  which seems wrong. (the 7400 manual says a hard-reset jumps initializes t=
he
  prefix to 0xfff00000.)

  Likewise, init_excp_7450() (and probably other, related CPUs) are
  wrong.

  Indeed, when I change the value in init_excp_7400() to 0xfff00000UL then
  everything works as expected for me.
