Yeah, it might be best to add a new boolean in order for that last example
to work as expected. At least my expectation would be that we'd set the
max vq to 2, when sve is disabled nothing happens to it, but then when sve
is reenabled we'll still have that max vq 2. I'm guessing you're expecting
that too, since you brought it up. I think the other two examples above
are behaving as I'd expect them to.

Hmm, that's probably worth trying. Also reworking vfp and neon to use the
fields as the properties, putting the sanity checks directly in the
property set accessor may work too. pmu and aarch64 could work like that
too, but those still have ARM_FEATURE_* bits, so they're not really the
same [yet].

Yeah, I'll remove for v3.
