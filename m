we can try to resurrect and put over it some kind of protocol
to describe which CPUs to where hotplugged.

or we could put a parameter into SMI status register (IO port 0xb3)
and the trigger SMI from GPE handler to tell SMI handler that cpu
hotplug happened and then use QEMU's cpu hotplug interface
to enumerate hotplugged CPUs for SMI handler.

The later is probably simpler as we won't need to reinvent the wheel
(just reuse the interface that's already in use by GPE handler).
