I don't have a better idea, but a little background on why libvirt even 
invented private /dev in the first place. The reason was that 
occasionally, when udev ran its rules it would overwrite the security 
labels on /dev nodes set by libvirt and thus denying access to QEMU. See:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1354251

Now, I think there is the same risk with what you are proposing. This 
isn't problem for DAC where permissions are checked during open(), but 
it may be a problem for SELinux where each individual operation with the 
FD is inspected.

Having said that, I am not against this approach, in fact I'm in favour 
of it. Let's hope that people learned that having udev overwriting 
seclabels is a bad idea and the bug won't appear again.
