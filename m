Yes, I mentioned earlier in the thread that doing this security check at
runtime is going to be a huge amount of work, because it will need to be
wired up across a wide range of subsystems and APIS and implemnetations
in the QEMU codebase.

I don't think option parsing time will be the place you want a check
at all. You need to parse the --security flag, but once that's done
I think everything else needs to be done at time of object creation,
not config parsing. That ensures the check is present in all possible
codepaths that lead to the functionality being used.

My suggestion is to do compile time stuff first, as that ought to be a
simpler problem. Having said that, if Paolo's work on meson is likely
to arrive any time soon, then it might make sense to wait for that,
instead of implementing something for Make and then throwing it away
a release later and doing it from scratch in Meson.

Daniel
