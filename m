I'd suggest to use gitlab, since we're currently focusing on that for
our CI. So get an account on gitlab, clone the qemu repository there
(https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu) to your account, and then you
should almost be ready to go: Edit the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the
repository, and once you push your local branch to the gitlab server,
you should see the jobs running in the "CI / CD" section. (Not sure
anymore whether you have to enable the CI manually for your project,
though, but it should not be too hard to find that setting if that's the
case)

I'm not aware of any CI tests that is currently using leak detection ...
so it's certainly welcome if we get more test coverage here!
