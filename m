If we were modifying existing funtionality then introducing a dep on
libbpf would be a problem as you'd be breaking existing QEMU users
on distros without libbpf.

This is brand new functionality though, so it is fine to place a
requirement on libbpf. If distros don't ship that library and they
want BPF features in QEMU, then those distros should take responsibility
for adding libbpf to their package set.

I've double checked with Fedora, and generating the BPF program from
source is a mandatory requirement for QEMU. Pre-generated BPF bytecode
is not permitted.

There was also a question raised about the kernel ABI compatibility
for BPF programs ? 

  https://lwn.net/Articles/831402/

  "The basic problem is that when BPF is compiled, it uses a set
   of kernel headers that describe various kernel data structures
   for that particular version, which may be different from those
   on the kernel where the program is run. Until relatively recently,
   that was solved by distributing the BPF as C code along with the
   Clang compiler to build the BPF on the system where it was going
   to be run."

Is this not an issue for QEMU's usage of BPF here ?

The dependancy on llvm is unfortunate for people who build with GCC,
but at least they can opt-out via a configure switch if they really
want to. As that LWN article notes, GCC will gain BPF support
