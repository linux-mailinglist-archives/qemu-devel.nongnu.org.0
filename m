qemu enforces that the header is one cluster.  But you're right, that=20
does not appear to directly be a limitation mandated by the spec, and we=20
could relax qemu to allow the header to be several consecutive clusters.=20
  The tricky part, however, is that the backing file name is NOT=20
described by a header extension, but rather is just whatever bytes occur=20
after the final header extension.  There's no clear indication anywhere=20
on when to stop reading those bytes, other than by an implicit limit=20
such as insisting those bytes fall within the first cluster.

Had we been smarter when designing v3, we would have made the backing=20
file name a header extension (in fact, it would have been possible to=20
design the additional fields of v3 to look like an unknown header=20
extension when parsed by a v2 binary) - but hindsight is 20/20.

We'd still want a sane limit even for small-cluster images (maybe "no=20
more than 2M of header information, regardless of cluster size); or=20
maybe even introduce a NEW header field and/or extension to make it=20
obvious how many clusters are being used for the purpose of the metadata=20
header in this particular image (with sane fallbacks for when that=20
extension is not present).  But you're right - it comes with complexity.=20
  This patch as written is safe for 5.0-rc1, but this discussion about=20
teaching qemu to permit headers larger than 1 cluster is squarely in the=20
5.1 category, if at all.
