Yes, I think this is how you'd best implement it.

Right, this part shows that we're kind of abusing the permission system
here. I think unconditionally adding BLK_PERM_SUPPORT_ZONED to the set
of shared permissions could probably happen centrally in
bdrv_child_perm().

I'm not sure it would be better. It is shared_perm because that means
that the default is restrictive (error mode: operation refused, clearly
reported, easy to fix) rather than permissive (error mode: image
corruption, hard to figure out where we were too permissive). Basically,
whitelist instead of blacklist, once again.

But if we did indeed decide to change it, the only way to find out how
hard it is would be doing it. I suspect not too hard in principle, but
making sure that we converted all callers and don't introduce wrong
callers later through (silent) merge conflicts is the more concerning
part.
