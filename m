Thanks for the suggestions. Actually, we choose to save all state
information to QEMU because a virtiofsd has the same lifecycle as its
QEMU master. However, saving things to a file do avoid communication with
QEMU, and we no longer need to increase the complexity of vhost-user
protocol. The suggestion to save fds to the systemd is also very reasonable
if we don't consider the lifecycle issues, we will try it.

All the best,
Jiachen

USAGE and NOTES:<br>
<br>
- The commits are rebased to a recent QEMU master commit b4d939133dca0fa2b.=
<br>
<br>
- &quot;,reconnect=3D1&quot; should be added to the &quot;-chardev socket&q=
uot; of vhost-user-fs-pci<br>
in the QEMU command line, for example:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 qemu-system-x86_64 ... \<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 -chardev socket,id=3Dchar0,path=3D/tmp/vhostqemu,reconnect=3D=
1 \<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 -device vhost-user-fs-pci,queue-size=3D1024,chardev=3Dchar0,t=
ag=3Dmyfs \<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 ...<br>
<br>
- We add new options for virtiofsd to enable or disable crash reconnection.=
<br>
And some options are not supported by crash reconnection. So add following<=
br>
options to virtiofsd to enable reconnection:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 virtiofsd ... -o reconnect -o no_mount_ns -o no_flock -o no_p=
osix_lock<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 -o no_xattr ...<br>
<br>
- The reasons why virtiofsd-side locking, extended attributes, and mount<br=
>
namespace are not supported is explained in the commit message of the 6th<b=
r>
patch (virtiofsd: Add two new options for crash reconnection).<br>
<br>
- The 9th patch is a work-around that will not affect the overall correctne=
ss.<br>
We remove the qsort related codes because we found that when resubmit_num i=
s<br>
larger than 64, seccomp will kill the virtiofsd process.<br>
<br>
- Support for dax version virtiofsd is very possible and requires almost no=
<br>
additional change to this patchset.<br>
