Comes back to my question of what is the benefit of using the .pc file
when what we have already works and is known to be portable.

When using meson there is essentially zero burden to using the
libgcrypt-config approach, because that's all handled transparently
by meson.  This is different from the situation with configure,
where libgcrypt-config required extra work on our side.

Overall I don't see any need to change it.

Daniel
