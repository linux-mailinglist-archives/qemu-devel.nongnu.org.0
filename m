The reason why I chose that ordering is because I think it's more
natural for debugging if you read from left to right:

63    56 55    48 47    40 39    32 31    24 23    16 15     8 7      0

      subcluster reads as zeros            subcluster is allocated

Here the last five subclusters read as zeros, and the first three
subclusters are allocated.

I don't think the math is any different. What you need in the code is

  1) A way to get the subcluster index. That doesn't change, it's

        sc_index = (address >> cluster_bits) & 31

     in both cases.

  2) A way to get the "subcluster reads as zeros" and "subcluster is
     allocated" masks. That's not very different either, it's a constant
     shifted by the subcluster index in both cases:

     LSB first:

        all_zeros_mask = (1 << 32) << sc_index
        allocated_mask = 1 << sc_index

     MSB first:

        all_zeros_mask = (1 << 63) >> sc_index
        allocated_mask = (1 << 31) >> sc_index

I can't think of any reason why you would want smaller clusters, the
numbers show that the performance starts to drop with sizes under 16KB.

As far as I'm aware they work just fine (I'll add tests for that
anyway).
