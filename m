You have the previous inserted element, so it is kind of easy O:-)

    prev =3D NULL;
    while (qemu_get_byte(f)) {
        elm =3D g_malloc(size);
        ret =3D vmstate_load_state(f, vmsd, elm, version_id);
        if (ret) {
            error_report("%s: failed to load %s (%d)", field->name,
                         vmsd->name, ret);
            g_free(elm);
            return ret;
        }
        if (!prev) {
            QLIST_RAW_INSERT_HEAD(pv, elm, entry_offset);
        } else {
            QLIST_RAW_INSERT_AFTER(prev, elm, entry_offset);
        }
        prev =3D elm;
    }

And yes, I realize that there is no QLIST_RAW_INSTERT_AFTER() (it is
QLIST_INSERT_AFTER).  And no, I haven't took the time to understand the
different between QLIST and QLIST_RAW.  From a quick look, it seems that
QLIST_RAW is embededed inside other structure.

But as said, we can move that to another patch.

Later, Juan.
