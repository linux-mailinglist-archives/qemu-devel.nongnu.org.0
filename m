Hi Andreas,
so the only upgrade you did to trigger this for you was to bump the kernel =
from 5.4.0-28.33 to 5.4.0-29.34 - nothing else? I have not (yet?) heard oth=
er similar reports, but it might be just too early?
At least on my system for now things still work with the new kernel like be=
fore.

I'd recommend filing a new bug, refer to this one as maybe being related an=
d adding the following right away:
- kernel version (you have this here I know)
- qemu/libvirt/seabios/ovmf version (if you don't mind just attach `dpkg -l=
`)
- guest XML (if using libvirt) otherwise the qemu command-line
- add a cross check and report what happens with other guests configs (e.g.=
 non windows, using =

  another bios as the former issue was tied to seabios, use different guest=
 CPU types)
- the full /var/log/apt/history.log
- a date when you last started the VM successfully (not just still-had-it-r=
unning, but started it) =

  and the date when it started to fail (probably yesterday then I guess)

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
