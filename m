I don't think I was trying to :), but sure, I can dedicate some time to it.
I'll need a bit of guidance in the QEMU world though for sure.

Yeah, that one will be a major change. Thinking about this some more, while
having a QEMU project inside lcitool sounds definitely useful, it would
probably be a wasted effort wrt task priority right now, because without
expanding lcitool's range of applicable hosts I don't see how QEMU would
utilize the tool without using quirks.

I didn't want to suggest this as a replacement to vars.yml.
What if people wanting to run the playbook don't have their own repo and you
(I mean you personally) are not providing a fresh build of gitlab-runner for
the given architecture?
The automation machinery would surely be more complex, but at the same time,
I can image a dedicated playbook that would handle gitlab-runner building and
installation of the binary to the correct place, you'd then simply include that
playbook if vars.yml don't specify an alternative repo and download from AWS
failed.
Another thing to consider - you currently host the missing arch builds under
your personal namespace on fedorapeople, what if you decide one day you're not
interested in being involved in QEMU CI that much and suddenly you stop
building the binaries, someone has to take over. On the other hand, if you
automate this whole process, having exposed the builds would definitely not
slow down machine provisions, but would also not cause them to fail if nobody
exposes them.

Okay, I was simply curious. If it's not something you don't need at the moment,
then let's not focus on it.

What do you mean by "service management lib"?
