I could only answer from QEMU x86 perspective.
QEMU for x86 guests currently doesn't add hot-pluggable RAM into E820
because of different linux guests tend to cannibalize it, making it non
unpluggable. The last culprit I recall was KASLR.

So I'd refrain from reporting hotpluggable RAM in GetMemoryMap() if
it's possible (it's probably hack (spec deosn't say anything about it)
but it mostly works for Linux (plug/unplug) and Windows guest also
fine with plug part (no unplug there)).

As for physical systems, there are out there ones that do report
hotpluggable RAM in GetMemoryMap().
