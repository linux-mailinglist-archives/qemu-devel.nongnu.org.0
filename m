From: Michal Privoznik <mprivozn@redhat.com>

When user tries to hotplug a VFIO device, but the operation fails
somewhere in the middle (in my testing it failed because of
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK forbidding more memory allocation), then a double
free occurs. In vfio_realize() the vdev->migration_blocker is
allocated, then something goes wrong which causes control to jump
onto 'error' label where the error is freed. But the pointer is
left pointing to invalid memory. Later, when
vfio_instance_finalize() is called, the memory is freed again.

In my testing the second hunk was sufficient to fix the bug, but
I figured the first hunk doesn't hurt either.
