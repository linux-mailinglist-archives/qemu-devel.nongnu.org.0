Though I've had this idea once or twice, I'm not working on real BMCs,
so I didn't really pursue anything.  It's a good idea, I think, for the
BMC developers, and possibly for system developers trying to do
integration testing between BMCs and system software.

You will need to tie in to more emulation than just the BMC side of the
system interface registers.  You will also need to tie into GPIOs or
whatnot for things like host reset.

Power handling is going to be a bit weird.  The OpenIPMI emulator
starts/stops qemu based upon power control.  It might be possible to do
the same thing in this sort of emulator.

You may need extensions to the protocol, and that's fine.  I can't think
of any at the moment, but you never know.

It's certainly a good start.  The second patch would be useful right
now.  There are more details, of course, but I think that's covered in
the man page under the various devices.

Thanks,
