Hi,

Sorry for the delayed reply.  I was away from work for the whole
month of January.

This is not a supported use case of named CPU models.  Named CPU
models should expose the same guest ABI on all hosts.  This means
CPUID should be the same on all hosts if using the same CPU
model (and same machine type).

If you need features to be automatically enabled/disabled
depending on host capabilities, I advise you to use "-cpu host"
or libvirt's mode=3Dhost-model.

I'm CCing Brijesh Singh and Babu Moger, who works on the EPYC CPU
model recently.

Note that this is done automatically by libvirt if using
mode=3Dhost-model.
