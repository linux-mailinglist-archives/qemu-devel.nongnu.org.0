In your cover letter, you said you changed things to tolerate this bit 
being set even with extended L2 entries.  Does this sentence need a tweak?

Also this sentence.

Why two spaces after '-'?  I understand it in situations like '0 -  3' 
in the same list as '16 - 19', to make for a right-justified column, but 
here, everything in the second column is two digits, so the extra 
padding doesn't add anything useful.  Or did you mean to have '64 -  95' 
and '96 - 127', making it obvious that these are the second set of bits 
on top of the existing bits in the first 8 bytes?

Of course, if you change to 64-95 and 96-127, the two sentences mapping 
bit x to subcluster y need adjusting by 64 as well.

I can live with the wording as-is (since you did call out the "second 64 
bits" or with the adjusted bit numberings.
