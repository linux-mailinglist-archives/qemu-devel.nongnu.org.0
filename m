Seems, we just don't have users of bdrv_co_block_status_above with base points within the chain, base is always NULL or backing of top. So, I don't think we have a reproducer.

>>> Why?  If we replaced the backing file to something longer (qemu-img rebase -u), we would WANT to read from the backing file.  The only reason we read zero is because the block layer synthesized it _while_ deferring to the backing layer, not because it was directly allocated in the top layer.

If you mean current bs, than replacing it doesn't make sense in the context, as block_status_above requested the current bs (as part of base..top range), not the other one.
