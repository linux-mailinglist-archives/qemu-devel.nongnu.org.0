So far it seems to be related to SLOF not being able to create
new nodes in the DT when parsing the FDT returned by CAS. SLOF
stops the parsing and returns an error. The guest ends up with
a broken DT and eventually hangs later (in my case the kernel
believes it is going to do hash while radix was negotiated with
QEMU). I need to dig some more.

Yes but in the latter case a full machine reset occurs and
spapr->ov5_cas gets cleared, ie. spapr_ovec_subset() returns
true in the check above no matter what.

>=20

IIUC this is specifically for "removed capabilities since last
CAS". This can happen if:
1) we're already processing a CAS reboot or,
2) a freshly rebooted guest calls CAS twice without being rebooted
   in between.

Since a freshly booted or rebooted guest can only trigger a CAS
reboot because of a "hotplug-before-CAS", if we manage to get rid
of this limitation, 1) cannot happen anymore.

The linux kernel seems to be only calling "ibm,client-architecture-support"
once during early boot so 2) should _never_ happen. Do we care to support
this scenario anyway ?

>=20

I tend to agree.
