To achieve these goals, later patches will add invocations of this macro 
at the start of functions with either use 
error_prepend/error_append_hint (solving 1) or which use 
local_err+error_propagate to check errors, switching those functions to 
use *errp instead (solving 2 and 3).

It doesn't _have_ to be the first line to compile (we require C99+ 
compilers, which allow declarations after statements); but rather 
because it makes it easier for our Coccinelle conversion script to catch 
outliers.  But I think this text is okay, without calling out that extra 
information (maybe the commit message should mention it, though).

double () () looks odd, as does the mid-sentence newline.

The macro itself is fine, my comments are solely on the commit message 
and comments.  Depending on how much cleanup Markus is willing to do 
rather than require a respin, you can add:
