Thanks for the review so far :)

Not yet, but Nubus was available on non-Apple machines. Given that TYPE_NUBUS_BRIDGE 
and TYPE_MAC_NUBUS_BRIDGE are already there, it seems a shame to prevent anyone who 
wanted to experiment with Nubus in other ways by hard-coding in the Macintosh 
restrictions.

Architecturally a Nubus always has 16 slots with 1 IRQ per slot (you can compare this 
with PCI always having 32 slots with 4 possible IRQs per slot). In the Macintosh 
design Apple restricted the available address space by mapping a partial address 
range onto the CPU bus, so I'd argue that this is an implementation property of the 
bridge. And of course device properties already exist which helps make things easier 
too :)


ATB,

Mark.
