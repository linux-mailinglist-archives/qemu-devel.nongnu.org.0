Good point. I tried that out, and everything still works.
Functionality-wise, I don't think it makes a big difference (for example
look at the other calls to add_project*arguments, which all pass in
arrays returned by split()), but its probably better to stick with what
is written in the official docs. I ran oss-fuzz builds with this change
and, unfortunately, the order of the calls to add_project_link_arguments
still makes a difference.

I tried that when I was attempting to fix the original build-issue, but
to no avail... I don't have a good explanation. On one hand, the problem
was related to the fact that we were linking in libqos.a. Renaming it to
libqos.fa was part of the fix. On the other hand, we also needed to
specify the arguments as part of global project link arguments, rather
than the proper way with executable() link_args.

I think Paolo had a better understanding of the actual issue, and some
ideas about how to fix this within meson, rather than with the hacks
exemplified by this patch.
