I'm a little bit concerned with this approach:
(n->bar0.addr + n->ctrl_mem.addr) and hoping to have some debate. Let me 
describe my understanding of the problem.
It looks to me that addr field sometimes contains *absolute* address (when no 
hierarchy is used) and other times it contains *relative* address (when
hierarchy is created). From my perspective use of this field is inconsistent
and thus error-prone.  
Because of that I think that doing n->bar0.addr + n->ctrl_mem.addr doesn't
solve root problem and is still prone to the same problem if in the future
we potentially build even more complicated hierarchy.
I think that we could solve it by introducing helper function like

hwaddr memory_region_get_abs_addr(MemoryRegion *mr) 

to retrieve absolute address and in the documentation indicate that addr field
can be relative or absolute and it is recommended to use above function to 
retrieve absolute address.
What do you think?

This is kernel limitation that we have to live with. The minimum granularity
of devm_memremap_pages() is 2MB and it must be 2MB aligned. It used to worse
at 128MB size+align (section-size), but sub-section memory-hotplug patches 
adjusted that to a 2MB section. 
Ensuring 2MiB size and alignment in the device emulation makes sense to me.
Perhaps we could document that limitations - making user more aware of it.
