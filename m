Maybe I should completely remove the type then ?

Do you mean for the function here or in general for the name of the phase ?

Initially I was thinking that so I put an assert.

But while testing I found out that it is triggered by the raspi machine
during its reset because the qbus tree is modified during it.

So it depends if we consider this kind of action to be faulty. With no
migration support, the only way to trigger it is to modify the qdev
hierarchy during reset.

But it made me think about the migration cases (with "staying in reset
state"). There are some cases where migration between 2 different
versions can lead to problem with the counter (typically if you migrate
to a new version that have a new device on a bus held in reset).

Since the whole point of the phases is to make the reset independent of
the order in which it is "scheduled", I think we could consider it as
"unspecified". If we find out that we need some hierarchical order for a
yet unknown reason, we can change it.

I've used the order children then parent because it is the actual qdev
reset order and we do not want to modify the actual order now.

>> + * ResettableClass:
>> + * Interface for resettable objects.
>> + *
>> + * See docs/devel/reset.rst for more detailed information about
>> + * how QEMU models reset.
>> + *
>> + * All objects which can be reset must implement this interface;
>> + * it is usually provided by a base class such as DeviceClass or BusClass.
>> + * Every Resettable object must maintain some state tracking the
>> + * progress of a reset operation by providing a ResetState structure.
>> + * The functions defined in this module take care of updating the
>> + * state of the reset.
>> + * The base class implementation of the interface provides this
>> + * state and implements the associated method: get_state.
>> + *
>> + * Concrete object implementations (typically specific devices
>> + * such as a UART model) should provide the functions
>> + * for the phases.init, phases.hold and phases.exit methods, which
>> + * they can set in their class init function, either directly or
>> + * by calling resettable_class_set_parent_phases().
>> + * The phase methods are guaranteed to only only ever be called once
>> + * for any reset event, in the order 'init', 'hold', 'exit'.
>> + * An object will always move quickly from 'init' to 'hold'
>> + * but might remain in 'hold' for an arbitrary period of time
>> + * before eventually reset is deasserted and the 'exit' phase is called.
>> + * Object implementations should be prepared for functions handling
>> + * inbound connections from other devices (such as qemu_irq handler
>> + * functions) to be called at any point during reset after their
>> + * 'init' method has been called.
>> + *
>> + * Users of a resettable object should not call these methods
>> + * directly, but instead use the function resettable_reset().
>> + *
>> + * @phases.init: This phase is called when the object enters reset. It
>> + * should reset local state of the object, but it must not do anything that
>> + * has a side-effect on other objects, such as raising or lowering a qemu_irq
>> + * line or reading or writing guest memory. It takes the reset's type as
>> + * argument.
>> + *
>> + * @phases.hold: This phase is called for entry into reset, once every object
>> + * in the system which is being reset has had its @phases.init method called.
>> + * At this point devices can do actions that affect other objects.
>> + *
>> + * @phases.exit: This phase is called when the object leaves the reset state.
>> + * Actions affecting other objects are permitted.
>> + *
>> + * @get_state: Mandatory method which must return a pointer to a ResetState.
>> + *
>> + * @foreach_child: Executes a given function on every Resettable child. Child
>> + * in this context means a child in the qbus tree, so the children of a qbus
>> + * are the devices on it, and the children of a device are all the buses it
>> + * owns. This is not the same as the QOM object hierarchy. The function takes
>> + * an additional ResetType argument which is passed to foreach_child.
