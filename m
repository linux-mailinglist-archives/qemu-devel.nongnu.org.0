hi Dave
there are already devices that are able to track the system memory,
through two ways:
(1) software method. like VFs for "Intel(R) Ethernet Controller XL710 Family
support".
(2) hardware method. through hardware internal buffer (as one Intel
internal hardware not yet to public, but very soon) or through VTD-3.0
IOMMU.

we have already had code verified using the two ways to track system memory
in fine-grained level.

I think the problem here is that we mixed pinned pages with dirty pages.
yes, pinned pages for mdev devices are continuously likely to be dirty
until device stopped.
But for devices that are able to report dirty pages, dirtied pages
will be marked again if hardware writes them later.

So, is it good to introduce a capability to let vfio/qemu know how to
treat the dirty pages?
(1) for devices have no fine-grained dirty page tracking capability
  a. pinned pages are regarded as dirty pages. they are not cleared by
  dirty page query
  b. unpinned pages are regarded as dirty pages. they are cleared by
  dirty page query or UNMAP ioctl.
(2) for devices that have fine-grained dirty page tracking capability
   a. pinned/unpinned pages are not regarded as dirty pages
   b. only pages they reported are regarded as dirty pages and are to be
   cleared by dirty page query and UNMAP ioctl.
(3) for dirty pages marking APIs, like vfio_dma_rw()...
   pages marked by them are regared as dirty and are to be cleared by
   dirty page query and UNMAP ioctl

For (1), qemu VFIO only reports dirty page amount and would not transfer
those pages until last round.
for (2) and (3), qemu VFIO should report and transfer them in each
round.

yes. that's why we have to do multi-round dirty page query and
transfer and clear the dirty bitmaps in each round for devices that are
able to track in fine grain.
and that's why we have to report the amount of dirty pages before
stop-and-copy phase for mdev devices, so that people are able to know
the real downtime as much as possible.
