Interesting. I wonder whether that detection is specifically related
to the fuzzing, or whether it is something we would have seen merely
by building with 'asan' and running 'make check' as normal.

IIUC, the oss-fuzz job we run in GitLab CI is mostly just a sanity
check and the real fuzzing work takes place in Google's fuzz service.
