I'm hoping most of the linux-user changes are in the hexagon runloop?
There has been quite a bit of work splitting up and cleaning up the
#ifdef mess in linux-user over the last few years.

You could run -nostdlib system TCG tests (hello and memory) but that
would require modelling some sort of hardware and assumes you have a
simple serial port or semihosting solution. That said a bunch of the
MIPS tests are linux-user and -nostdlib so that isn't a major problem in
getting some of the tests running.

When you say code imported from the hexagon simulator I was under the
impression you were generating code from the instruction description.
Otherwise you'll need to be very clear about your licensing grants.

I think the interesting question is if the roll-back semantics of the
hexagon are something we might need for other emulated architectures or
is a particularly specific solution for Hexagon (I'm guessing the later).

One thing to nail down will be will we include the generated code in the
source tree with a tool to regenerate (much like we do for
linux-headers) or if we want to add the dependency and regenerate each
time from scratch. I don't see including flex/bison as a dependency
being a major issue (in fact we have it in our docker images so I guess
something uses it). However it might be trickier depending on
libclang which was also being discussed.

It does a byte-wise comparison of two register pairs and sets a predicate r=
