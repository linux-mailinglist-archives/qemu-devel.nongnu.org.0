FWIW, I really hate virtio-pci's disable-modern/disable-legacy... for a
starter, what is 'modern'? Will we have 'ultra-modern' in the future?
It is also quite backwards with the 'disable' terminology.

We also have a different mechanism for virtio-ccw ('max_revision',
which covers a bit more than virtio-1; it doesn't have a 'min_revision',
as negotiating the revision down is fine), so I don't see why
virtio-mmio should replicate the virtio-pci mechanism.

Also, IIUC, virtio-mmio does not have transitional devices, but either
version 1 (legacy) or version 2 (virtio-1). It probably makes more
sense to expose the device version instead; either as an exact version
(especially if it isn't supposed to go up without incompatible
changes), or with some min/max concept (where version 1 would stand a
bit alone, so that would probably be a bit awkward.)
