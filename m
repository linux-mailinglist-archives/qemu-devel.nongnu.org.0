That sounds surprising ... according to the source code:
https://git.qemu.org/?p=3Dqemu.git;a=3Dblob;f=3Dhw/usb/hcd-xhci.c;hb=3Dv5.1=
.0#l3386
... QEMU already sets 0x30 as programming interface byte there. Could you p=
lease double-check whether your problem still occurs with the latest versio=
n of QEMU?

Title:
  Missing PCI "programming interface" ID emulation for USB host
  controllers

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Qemu doesn't currently emulate the correct value of the "register
  level programming interface" field in the PCI config space of USB host
  controllers. As a result, some guest operating systems (most notably
  Windows) fail to load e.g. generic xHCI drivers, and instead ask for a
  vendor-specific driver, which may not be always available.

  Example: "-device nec-usb-xhci" emulates a Renesas (formerly NEC)
  uPD720202 xHCI controller. However, in the PCI config space, it shows
  us as class 0C, subclass 03, prog-if 00 (UHCI) where as the real
  uPD720202 (and all real xHCI controllers) have prog-if 30 (xHCI). A
  Windows guest booted with this option will not recognize devices
  attached to the XHCI controller unless drivers from Renesas are
  manually installed first, even though recent Windows versions include
  a generic xHCI driver that works perfectly well with real uPD720202
  hardware.
