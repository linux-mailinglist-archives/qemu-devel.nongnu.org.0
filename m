I just think, that binding the concept to the "backing" link of the node is simpler and more generic. In blockdev era, when all nodes will be named and libvirt will take care of all nodes including filters, we will not need any filter-skipping magic, libvirt will directly point to exact nodes it means. And we can deprecate "file" children of existing filters, to finally reach simple architecture with simple backing chain of nodes (any nodes). And after deprecating old filename-based interfaces, we'll drop all filter-skipping magic..

What do you think?
