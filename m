We have to be careful when migrating the FP registers within a CPU,
since they can have crazy values that are not valid/weird corners of
standard FP encodings (e.g. if the guest just uses the FP registers as
a spare 64bit register - which is perfectly valid on some
architectures). However, migrating an actual floating point
real world measurement should be fine.  I'm assuming we can rely on
64 bit IEEE FP format on the wire being portable.
