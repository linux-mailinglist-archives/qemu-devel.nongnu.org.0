You're very welcome to do this, but what you're doing is effectively a
*distribution of QEMU* that targets the "macOS build from source" scenario,
for people that don't want to use Homebrew. It is *not* going to be used by
QEMU developers, because QEMU developers have conflicting requirements:

* Not getting in the business of maintaining a distribution of all their
dependencies (glib, pixman, etc.)

* Not wanting to maintain multiple build systems

both of which are non-negotiable.

What you might do is use the configure script and the ninja backend to
build all generated sources (produced by either configure, meson or make);
then copy those generated file over to a new build directory, invoke meson
again with the xcode backend, and distribute the result so that it is ready
to build from source using xcode. The resulting distribution is not
appropriate to develop QEMU, but it would be okay to install it and even
for some simple debugging.

The above approach still doesn't solve the problem of building glib and
friends as part of the same xcode project. Perhaps this can be fixed by
patching the xcodeproj that Meson generated.

The scripts needed to do so should be relatively stable and can certainly
be included in the upstream QEMU sources. You can't expect that other
people will test them unless you also include them somehow in our CI, but
just having the scripts would be a start.

Thanks,

Paolo
