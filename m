We shouldn't overthink this and invent many classification levels.

This is essentially about distinguishing code that is written with the
intent of protecting from a malicous guest, from code that assumes a
non-malicious guest. That is a pretty clear demarcation on when it is
reasonable to use any given feature in QEMU.

Within the set of code that is assuming a malicious guest, there are
still going to be varying levels of quality, and that is ok. We don't
need to express that programatically, the docs are still there to
describe the fine nuances of any given feature. We're just saying that
in general, this set of code is acceptable to use in combination with
a malicious guest, and if you find bugs we'll triage them as security
flaws.

9p is generally written from the POV of protecting against a malicious
guest, so it would be considered part of the high security set, and
flaws will be treated as CVEs. We don't need to be break it down into
any more detail than that.

Daniel
