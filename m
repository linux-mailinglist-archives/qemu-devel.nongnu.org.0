I also pushed this and the previous two patchsets to my qemu fork on github=
.
The branches are named npcm7xx-v[1-5].

  https://github.com/hskinnemoen/qemu

This patch series models enough of the Nuvoton NPCM730 and NPCM750 SoCs to =
boot
an OpenBMC image built for quanta-gsj. This includes device models for:

  - Global Configuration Registers
  - Clock Control
  - Timers
  - Fuses
  - Memory Controller
  - Flash Controller

These modules, along with the existing Cortex A9 CPU cores and built-in
peripherals, are integrated into a NPCM730 or NPCM750 SoC, which in turn fo=
rm
the foundation for the quanta-gsj and npcm750-evb machines, respectively. T=
he
two SoCs are very similar; the only difference is that NPCM730 is missing s=
ome
peripherals that NPCM750 has, and which are not considered essential for
datacenter use (e.g. graphics controllers). For more information, see

https://www.nuvoton.com/products/cloud-computing/ibmc/

Both quanta-gsj and npcm750-evb correspond to real boards supported by Open=
BMC.
At the end of the series, qemu can boot an OpenBMC image built for one of t=
hese
boards with some minor modifications.

The patches in this series were developed by Google and reviewed by Nuvoton=
. We
will be maintaining the machine and peripheral support together.

The data sheet for these SoCs is not generally available. Please let me kno=
w if
more comments are needed to understand the device behavior.

Changes since v4:
  - OTP cleanups suggested by Philippe Mathieu-Daud=C3=A9.
      - Added fuse array definitions based on public Nuvoton bootblock code=
.
      - Moved class structure to .c file since it's only used internally.
      - Readability improvements.
  - Split the first patch and folded parts of it into three other patches s=
o
    that CONFIG_NPCM7XX is only enabled after the initial NPCM7xx machine
    support is added.
  - DRAM init moved to machine init code.
  - Consistently use lower-case hex literals.
  - Switched to fine-grained unimplemented devices, based on public bootblo=
ck
    source code. Added a tiny SRAM that got left out previously.
  - Simplified error handling in npcm7xx_realize() since the board code wil=
l
    abort anyway, and SoCs are not hot-pluggable.

Changes since v3:

  - License headers are now GPL v2-or-later throughout.
  - Added vmstate throughout (except the memory controller, which doesn't
    really have any state worth saving). Successfully booted a gsj image
    with two stop/savevm/quit/loadvm cycles along the way.
      - JFFS2 really doesn't like it if I let qemu keep running after savev=
m,
        and then jump back in time with loadvm. I assume this is expected.
  - Fixed an error API violation in npcm7xx_realize, removed pointless erro=
r
    check after object_property_set_link().
  - Switched the OTP device to use an embedded array instead of a g_malloc0=
'd
    one because I couldn't figure out how to set up vmstate for the latter.

Changes since v2:

  - Simplified the MAINTAINERS entry.
  - Added link to OpenPOWER jenkins for gsj BMC images.
  - Reverted the smpboot change, back to byte swapping.
  - Adapted to upstream API changes:
      - sysbus_init_child_obj -> object_initialize_child
      - object_property_set_bool -> qdev_realize / sysbus_realize
      - ssi_create_slave_no_init -> qdev_new
      - qdev_init_nofail -> qdev_realize_and_unref
      - ssi_auto_connect_slaves removed
  - Moved Boot ROM loading from soc to machine init.
  - Plumbed power-on-straps property from GCR to the machine init code so i=
t
    can be properly initialized. Turns out npcm750 memory init doesn't work
    without this. npcm730 is fine either way, though I'm not sure why.
  - Reworked the flash init code so it looks more like aspeed (i.e. the fla=
sh
    device gets added even if there's no drive).

Changes since v1 (requested by reviewers):

  - Clarify the source of CLK reset values.
  - Made smpboot a constant byte array, eliinated byte swapping.
  - NPCM7xxState now stores an array of ARMCPUs, not pointers to ARMCPUs.
  - Clarify why EL3 is disabled.
  - Introduce NPCM7XX_NUM_IRQ constant.
  - Set the number of CPUs according to SoC variant, and disallow command l=
ine
    overrides (i.e. you can no longer override the number of CPUs with the =
-smp
    parameter). This is trying to follow the spirit of
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11595407/.
  - Switch register operations to DEVICE_LITTLE_ENDIAN throughout.
  - Machine documentation added (new patch).

Changes since v1 to support flash booting:

  - GCR reset value changes to get past memory initialization when booting
    from flash (patches 2 and 5):
      - INTCR2 now indicates that the DDR controller is initialized.
      - INTCR3 is initialized according to DDR memory size. A realize()
	method was implemented to achieve this.
  - Refactor the machine initialization a bit to make it easier to drop in
    machine-specific flash initialization (patch 6).
  - Extend the series with additional patches to enable booting from flash:
      - Boot ROM (through the -bios option).
      - OTP (fuse) controller.
      - Memory Controller stub (just enough to skip memory training).
      - Flash controller.
      - Board-specific flash initialization.

Thanks for reviewing,

Havard
