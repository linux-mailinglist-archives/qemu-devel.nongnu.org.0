I might have missed something but I don't see arch_id itself being used in
machine_set_cpu_numa_node(). It only uses props part of possible_cpus

when cpus are assigned explicitly, decision what cpus go to what nodes is
up to user and user configured mapping is stored in MachineState::possible_=
cpus
which is accessed by via possible_cpu_arch_ids() callback.
Hence I don see any reason to touch cpu indexes.

Looking at current code I don't see why one would touch numa code.
Care to explain in more details why you'd have to touch it?

it probably shouldn't be a part of X86CPUDefinition,
as it's machines responsibility to generate and set APIC ID.

What you are doing with this topo functions in this version
looks more that enough to me.

CPU might use call backs, but does it have to?
I see cpu_x86_cpuid() uses these functions to decode apic_id back to topo
info and then compose various leaves based on it.
Within CPU code I'd just use
 if (i_am_epyc)
    x86_topo_ids_from_apicid_epyc()
 else
    x86_topo_ids_from_apicid()
it's easier to read and one doesn't have to go figure
indirection chain to figure out what code is called.

Could be done like this, but considering that within machine we need
to calculate apic_id only once, the same 'if' trick would be simpler

x86_cpus_init() {

  if (cpu =3D=3D epic) {
     make_epyc_apic_ids(mc->possible_cpu_arch_ids(ms))
  }

  // go on with creating cpus ...
}

Is it supposed to work (i.e. can real hardware do such topology)?

without more information, it's hard to comment on issue and whether
extra complexity of callbacks is justificated.=20

There could be 2 ways here, add fixes to this series so we could see the re=
ason
or make this series simple to solve apic_id problem only and then on top of
it send the second series that solves another issue.

Considering that this series is already big/complicated enough,
personally I'd go for 2nd option. As it's easier to describe what patches a=
re
doing and easier to review =3D> should result in faster reaching consensus =
and merging.
