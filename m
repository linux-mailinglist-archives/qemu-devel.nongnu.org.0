I'd go with a simpler "tags:travis-ci" whitelisting any job expecting to
run smoothly there.

Then we can add "slow" tests without having to worry about blacklisting
for Travis CI.
Also, Other CI can set different timeouts.

I'd like maintainers to add as many tests as they want to upstream, so
these tests can eventually run by anyone, then each maintainer is free
to select which particular set he wants to run as default.
