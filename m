Commit 0bc16997 has already landed, so no further review will show in=20
git history. But you're always welcome to raise issues that might result=20
in follow-up patches.

Personally, I think that since nbdkit already provides a good partition=20
filter [1], any other implementation of a partition filter is duplicated=20
effort.  The only reason to teach qemu how to access an arbitrary=20
partition is if it makes serving that arbitrary partition to a guest=20
more efficient than what is currently possible by pointing qemu at an=20
NBD server run by nbdkit with its partition filter.  But in general, you=20
are more likely to want qemu to serve an entire disk image file to the=20
guest (and let the guest interpret partitions embedded within that file)=20
than to have qemu serve a single partition to a guest (and have the=20
guest treat that partition as a bare disk), so I don't see it as=20
something that would be frequently used or needed in qemu.
