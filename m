According to my tests with several guests it seems the via-ide does not 
seem to use PCI interrupts as described in the previous reply, only either 
legacy IRQ14 and 15 or one ISA IRQ line set by a config reg in native mode 
(except on Pegasos2). This may be due to how it's internally connected in 
the southbridge chip it's part of or some other platform specific quirk, 
I'm not sure.

The CMD646 may be a more conformant PCI device and use PCI interrupts 
(unless that also has some kind of legacy mode and similar interconnection 
with ISA interrupts). If it's really using PCI interrupt and Solaris still 
does not get expexted IRQ then maybe the routing is not matching real 
hardware somehow? Maybe it would help finding out what interrupt the 
Solaris driver is checking to find out why it misses the IRQ.
