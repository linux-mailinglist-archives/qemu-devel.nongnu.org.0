Errors-To: qemu-devel-bounces+lists+qemu-devel=lfdr.de@nongnu.org

The interesting part in emerge.log is:

  23473 socket(16,,IPPROTO_IP) =3D 5
  23473 bind(5,274886353720,12,0,1,274889671712) =3D 0
  23473 sendto(5,275542232672,38,0,274886353960,12) =3D -1 errno=3D95 (Oper=
ation not supported)
  23473 close(5) =3D 0
  Unable to configure loopback interface: Operation not supported

So you're right 16 is AF_NETLINK

At QEMU level only one function returns  EOPNOTSUPP, the one managing
RTM_* operations (RTM_GETLINK, RTM_GETADDR, ...) and it doesn't manage a
bunch of them.

Could you provide a step by step example to reproduce the problem?

Title:
  qemu user static binary seems to lack support for network namespace.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Whenever I execute emerge in gentoo linux in qemu-aarch64 chroot, I
  see the following error message.

  Unable to configure loopback interface: Operation not supported

  If I disable emerge's network-sandbox which utilizes network
  namespace, the error disappears.
