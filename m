Hi!

Sorry, I forgot about this one.

Haiku has a lot of options.. we can setup a vm image if needed to move this=
 along.
Haiku is graphical, but has ssh and all the standard tools.

Vagrant also supports Haiku and provides some automation around it.
https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?utf8=3D%E2%9C%93&sort=3Ddownloads&pr=
ovider=3D&q=3Dhaiku-os

Let me check out tests/vm/ to see if I can PR something.

Title:
  Maintain Haiku support

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  It was pointed out that the 2.10 release notes are pushing to drop
  Haiku support.  The qemu port is currently working as-is under Haiku.

  Was there a reason this was recommended? Is there anything Haiku can
  do to keep it from being dropped?

  We're working on a docker container to cross-compile rust-lang for
  Haiku, could this be of some use to qemu when complete?
