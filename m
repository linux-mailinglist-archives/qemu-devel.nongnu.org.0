Hi Alistair,

Sorry for the late reply.

>Do you know the current state of the spec?
As far as I can tell, the spec for PointerMasking is quite frozen: it has
not been updated for quite some time, but some of the clarifications have
not been included in the actual spec.
I'll ask the J workgroup if they could do draft release v0.1, while I'll
address the fixed you proposed in this patch series.
Meanwhile could you please tell, if it's ok to push several series of
patches to claim the support of i.e. v0.1 or it's mandatory to push all the
patches at once?

Thanks!

&gt;<br>
&gt; If this patch series would be accepted, I think my further attention w=
