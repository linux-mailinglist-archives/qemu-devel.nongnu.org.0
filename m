It's a special form of load that has the ordering, only on available 
on P10. It's a no-op on P9. 

Linux commit b1f9be9392f0 ("powerpc/xive: Enforce load-after-store  
ordering when StoreEOI is active") introduced the Load-after-Store 
ordering offset and P10 support was added in the same 5.8 release.

This is why StoreEOI should be advertised on P10 compat kernels only. 
I would have preferred to introduce some extra CAS bits. that would 
have been cleaner than mix the two.


The basic requirement is to advertise StoreEOI when the CPU compat
allows it. I have used the capabilities to toggle the feature on/off.
It seemed a clean way to cover all the extra needs : 

 - switch it off on P10 if needed
 - switch it on on P9 for tests

Yes. I have received a few ot these :
