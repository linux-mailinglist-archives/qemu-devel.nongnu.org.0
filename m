Discard is out of question of course.  I'd only add the option to
disable it if not needed.

No.  Well, at least it would not be *my* plan to reach feature parity.
I'm just trying to make available what we have.

The mmio versions of usb host adapters are needed anyway to emulate some
SoCs.  Describing them in device tree / ACPI is standardized so they
just work without additional changes on the guest side.  So this is
really just adding the device to the machine, adding a device tree node,
adding a acpi dsdt entry (roughly a dozen lines of code each).

Having virtio(-mmio) and usb is enough to cover alot of use cases.
Especially on arm where virtio-gpu is the only display device option.

usb is off by default so it doesn't add anything unless you
explicitly ask for it.

Oh, and pci adds some non-trivial stuff to the guest-to-QEMU
security boundary too ...

Ok, fair enough.

take care,
