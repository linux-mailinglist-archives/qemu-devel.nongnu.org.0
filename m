I hate such dead checks, because they make me assume they can actually
happen.  Incorrect assumptions breed bugs.

But I'm willing to defer to the maintainer here.  Gerd?

Work that into your commit message, please.  Might be easier if you

Really?

What makes executing multiple qmp_screendump() concurrently (in separate
threads) or interleaved (in separate coroutines in the same thread)
unsafe before this patch?

We should avoid making our dependence on implicit mutual exclusion
worse.  When we do it anyway, a big, fat, ugly comment is definitely
called for.

It is anything but: see appended patch.

If it wasn't for non-QMP calls (typically HMP, but also CLI), then
handlers for QMP commands with 'coroutine': true could be coroutine_fn.

So far, coroutine_fn is merely documentation.  Perhaps it can guide a
checker for "do coroutine stuff only in coroutines" some day.  Would be
nice, because the coroutine calls are often buried deep, and far away
from the code that ensures they run in a coroutine.

My point is: marking functions coroutine_fn is good.  We should do it
more.  We should try to avoid stuff that hinders doing it more.

Collecting several users before building infrastructure makes sense when
the design of the infrastructure isn't obvious, or when the need for it
is in doubt.

Neither is the case for running QMP handlers in a coroutine: QMP
commands blocking the main loop is without doubt a problem we need to
solve, and the way to solve it was obvious enough for Kevin to do it
with one user: block_resize.  A second one quickly followed: screendump.

The only part that's different for HMP, I think, is "need".

Is HMP blocking the main loop a problem?

If yes, is it serious enough to justify solving it?

If yes, then putting workarounds into QMP handlers now so we can put off
solving it some more is taking on technical debt.

Yes, such handlers may exist.  Running them out of coroutine context
would throw away their capability not to block the event loop, though,
wouldn't it?

Possibly stupid question: why is it necessary before this patch
(assuming it is, since we call it), and why is it no longer necessary
after?

Oh, see below.

When I ask a stupid question like this one, I'm really after the "for
dummies" explanation.  I may be able to figure it out myself with some
effort, but having to put that kind of effort into patch review makes me
grumpy, and once I'm sufficiently grumpy, I don't want to review patches
anymore, let alone merge them.

Oh well, let me try.  We're in the main loop.  We want to trigger a
"graphics update" (whatever that is, doesn't matter) and wait for it to
complete without blocking the main loop.

"Without blocking the main loop" means the QMP coroutine yields.  I'd
naively expect

    QMP coroutine: schedule the job; yield
    whatever gets scheduled: complete the job; wake up QMP coroutine

Now let's examine the "graphics update" interface.

GraphicHwOps callback gfx_update() comes in two flavours:

* synchronous: complete the job, return

* asynchronous: start the job, return immediately,
  graphic_hw_update_done() will get called on job completion

graphic_hw_update() partly hides the difference:

* synchronous: complete the job, call graphic_hw_update_done()

* asynchronous: start the job, return immediately,
  graphic_hw_update_done() will get called on job completion

This lets you treat the synchronous case more like the asynchronous
case.

You use graphic_hw_update_done() to wake up the QMP coroutine.

I think I can now answer my question "why is it okay not to call
graphic_hw_update() anymore when !qemu_in_coroutine()?"

Before the patch, both QMP and HMP:

* with synchronous gfx_update(): we update before we write out the
  screendump.  The screendump is up-to-date.  Both update and write out
  block the main loop.

* with asynchronous gfx_update(): we start updating, but don't wait for
  it to complete before we write out.  This is wrong.  Write out blocks
  the main loop, but update does not.

After the patch:

* QMP with either gfx_update(): we update before we write out the
  screendump.  The screendump is up-to-date.  Neither update nor write
  out block the main loop.  Improvement.

* HMP with either gfx_update(): we don't update before we write out.
  Similarly wrong for asynchronous gfx_update(), regression for
  synchronous gfx_update().  Write out blocks the main loop as before.

Why is the regression okay?

Back to the bottom half.  The way graphic_hw_update() works, the QMP
coroutine can't schedule then yield.  It *has* to yield before
graphic_hw_update() runs.  That means we need a bottom half.

Alright, I'm officially grumpy now.

Please explain the need for a bottom half in a comment.
