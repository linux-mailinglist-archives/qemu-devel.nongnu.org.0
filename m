This was a GSoC project and at that time libvirt GSoC projects were
under the QEMU umbrella. Libvirt now runs GSoC itself.

Either way, there's no particularly important content here, but it is
the second hit in google for "libvirt wireshark" ! I'm fine with it
being removed in general unless we want to keep a record of old GSoc
projects ?

Daniel
