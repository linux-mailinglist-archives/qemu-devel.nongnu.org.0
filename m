In a previous reply I've explained this (apart from just trying to get it 
work the simplest way for testing first):

So I know this should be improved but not sure how. I would not worry 
about setting the bit from the start due to the above but exceptions are 
likely wrong this way as you say.

I'm not sure I get this. Can you please explain a bit more? Where would 
save_flags be set and where would the above masking with it be done? 
Currently we reset flags before every FP op as far as I understand and 
detecting of exceptions rely on this and test fp_status bits. Probably we 
should not reset the flags and change this to keep one fp_status 
accumulating flags and only reset if softfloat is forced but that would 
need rewriting exception handling that I'm not sure yet how to do. Any 
idea? Maybe if we could just unbreak inexact exceptions when enabled with 
current patch then this rewrite of exception handling could be done later.

What's wrong with hardfloat? That's how the code refers to this so if 
anyone searches what it does would turn up some meaningful results. Your 
proposed property name is very cryptic and nobody would be able to guess 
what is it for. If you insist not to use hardfloat maybe we could invert 
it to softfloat or try x-use-fpu maybe. I specificaly don't want to tie it 
to the FI but as there's at least another non-sticky bit in FPSCR (don't 
remember which now) that might also need to be broken for best hardfloat 
results.
