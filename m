Depends.  If the base-node was given to be literally "backing", then I=E2=
=80=99d
say the user wants us to use "backing" as the new base still.

I=E2=80=99m not sure.  Again, if I as the user specified the "backing" node=
-name
as the base, I=E2=80=99d expect that to be the new backing file in all case=
s.

It certainly is true that it does not address what happens when you
meddle with base.

(Except it can be argued (and I suppose I did argue that) that as it is
it does say the base file should be the backing file after stream, so if
the base file is still there, I do interpret that to mean that the
stream job always uses that as the backing node.  Of course even if it
says that, that doesn=E2=80=99t mean that it makes sense.  And if it doesn=
=E2=80=99t
make sense, then that=E2=80=99s the definition of a bug in the documentatio=
n, yes.)

I would have said that no semantics are promised for when the node is no
longer a valid base, so we can basically do what we think makes sense.

I was thinking that if the user does graph manipulation, we can expect
them to have given base-node.  So they actually did refer to a node name
and it makes sense to me to keep looking it up.

(As a side note: I originally intended to say =E2=80=9Cstoring a pointer or=
 the
node-name are the only things that come to mind, but obviously both are
stupid=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 but then I changed my mind and realized that the =
node name
maybe actually isn=E2=80=99t that stupid.)

Let=E2=80=99s maybe talk about it tomorrow. :-)
