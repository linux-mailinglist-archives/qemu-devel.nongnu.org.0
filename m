More likely the latter.  'make check' runs a subset of iotests under a 
subset of options, so this must not have been one of those options (or 
CI would have caught it sooner).  Running it manually with './check -nbd 
256' sees it, though.

My fault as well, since it was a rather late patch and I was trying to 
get it in -rc3, so I didn't complete as many tests on it as I would have 
liked before submitting the pull request.  Ah well, it won't be the 
first release with a broken iotest.  (Or if we really _do_ need -rc4, I 
can add this to the queue of nice-to-have)
