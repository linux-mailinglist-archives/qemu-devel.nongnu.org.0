This is not a copy of the enum as the other case you replied on.
It's just names "inspired" or "similar" to original names. They are not=20
even the same.

Honestly, even though I used slightly different names than original=20
open-vm-tools code, I think it's quite trivial to coorelate.
Both by similar name (not same), by value and by function. That's why I=20
don't have a strong opinion about the name.
I think VMPORT_CMD_GET_HZ is sufficient, but honestly I would name it=20
however you want. I really don't care.

I don't think any special comment is necessary here for correlation. But=20
I don't mind putting above enum a general comment such as:
/* See open-vm-tools lib/include/backdoor_def.h to match these to guest=20
commands */
