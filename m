All writers to the new postcopy_min_length should have BQL already.
The only left is the last cleanup_range() where we can take the BQL
for a while.  However...

... I think this persuaded me. :) You are right they can still be
protected until max_length with PROT_NONE.  Would you mind add some of
the above into the comment above unregister of uffd?
