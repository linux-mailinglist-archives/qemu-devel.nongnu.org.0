As far as I can see, qemu_ram_alloc_internal() calls g_malloc0() only to
allocate the the new RAMBlock object called "new_block". The actual
guest RAM allocation occurs inside ram_block_add(), which is also called
by qemu_ram_alloc_internal().

One frame outwards the stack, qemu_ram_alloc() passes NULL to
qemu_ram_alloc_internal(), for the 4th ("host") parameter. Therefore, in
qemu_ram_alloc_internal(), we set "new_block->host" to NULL as well.

Then in ram_block_add(), we take the (!new_block->host) branch, and call
phys_mem_alloc().

Unfortunately, "phys_mem_alloc" is a function pointer, set with
phys_mem_set_alloc(). The phys_mem_set_alloc() function is called from
"target/s390x/kvm.c" (setting the function pointer to
legacy_s390_alloc()), so it doesn't apply in this case. Therefore we end
up calling the default qemu_anon_ram_alloc() function, through the
funcptr. (I think anyway.)

And qemu_anon_ram_alloc() boils down to mmap() + MAP_ANONYMOUS, in
qemu_ram_mmap(). (Even on PPC64 hosts, because qemu_anon_ram_alloc()
passes (-1) for "fd".)

I may have missed something, of course -- I obviously didn't test it,
just speculated from the source.

Thanks
Laszlo
