I trust your judgement.

Since the Sphinx extension is in Python, we can try to reuse the QAPI
frontend there.  We'll see.

I'd like to encourage you to not feel bound to the existing doc comment
language.  When Marc-Andr=C3=A9 created the doc generator, he chose to fit
the doc comment language to the existing doc comments, to avoid churn.
That was probably the right decision then; getting the job done was
tough enough as it was.  The resulting language was basically defined by
its (ad hoc!) parser.  I cleaned up the parser some, and
retro-documented the syntax.  It's still an idiosyncratic mess, to be
honest.
