I mean, yes, you are right, it is broken, with or without the patch, so go
ahead, at least your series will fulfill its purpose, and I'll have enough
time to integrate the fix later on, without interfering each other.

Thanks for the series!

This is a one-liner, and it is required to achieve the goal of the<br>

If you prefer, I can instead comment the line with a FIXME, since it<br>
