> Hello,

I've started posting this series well in advance to get it into 6.0 and 
yet it seems like it may be missing it due to organisational issues (no 
real complaints were found with patches but Philippe seems to like more 
review that does not seem to happen as nobody is interested). Looks like 
David is waiting for an ack from Philippe but will be away next week so if 
this is not resolved now it may be too late on Monday. To avoid that:

David, could you please send an ack before you leave for the last two 
patches so it could get committed via some other tree while you're away?

Philippe, if you can't ack the vt82c686 patches now are you OK with taking 
the whole series via your tree before the freeze? That would give you some 
more days to review and it could always be reverted during the freeze but 
if it's not merged now I'll have to wait until the summer to get it in 
again which would be another long delay. I don't think this will get more 
reviews unless it's in master and people can start using and testing it 
better.

Thank you,
BALATON Zoltan
