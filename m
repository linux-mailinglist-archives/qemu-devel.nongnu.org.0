Looking at the musl port, I see at least one bug in their atomics jumping out 
at me:

It's a shot in the dark as to whether that'll fix your bug, but I could at 
least see a mechanism for it: before we yielded load reservations on context 
switches then that backwards branch would never be taken, so we wouldn't notice 
if tmp was allocated into one of the same registers as the inputs.  Even if it 
doesn't fix your issue it's still a bug so I'll send the patch out, just LMK so 
I can indicate how important the issue is.

This should manifest on hardware, but it looks like we managed to drop that SC 
patch.  I'll go send the patch out now...
