Wait. What. No. Stop!

It is unmistakably clear that you are invalidating my arguments about
portability and endianness issues by suggesting that we just remove
persistent state and deal with it later, but persistence is the killer
feature that sets the QEMU emulated device apart from other emulation
options. It is not about using emulation in production (because yeah,
why would you?), but persistence is what makes it possible to develop
and test "zoned FTLs" or something that requires recovery at power up.
This is what allows testing of how your host software deals with opened
zones being transitioned to FULL on power up and the persistent tracking
of LBA allocation (in my series) can be used to properly test error
recovery if you lost state in the app.

Please, work with me on this instead of just removing such an essential
feature. Since persistence seems to be the only thing we are really
discussing, we should have plenty of time until the soft-freeze to come
up with a proper solution on that.

I agree that my version had a format that was pretty ad-hoc and that
won't fly - it needs magic and version capabilities like in Dmitry's
series, which incidentially looks a lot like what we did in the
OpenChannel implementation, so I agree with the strategy.

ZNS-wise, the only thing my implementation stores is the zone
descriptors (in spec-native little-endian format) and the zone
descriptor extensions. So there are no endian issues with those. The
allocation tracking bitmap is always stored in little endian, but
converted to big-endian if running on a big-endian host.

Let me just conjure something up.

    #define NVME_PSTATE_MAGIC ...
    #define NVME_PSTATE_V1    1

    typedef struct NvmePstateHeader {
        uint32_t magic;
        uint32_t version;

        uint64_t blk_len;

        uint8_t  lbads;
        uint8_t  iocs;

        uint8_t  rsvd18[3054];

        struct {
            uint64_t zsze;
            uint8_t  zdes;
        } QEMU_PACKED zns;

        uint8_t  rsvd3089[1007];
    } QEMU_PACKED NvmePstateHeader;

With such a header we have all we need. We can bail out if any
parameters do not match and similar to nvme data structures it contains
reserved areas for future use. I'll be posting a v2 with this. If this
still feels too ad-hoc, we can be inspired by QCOW2 and the "extension"
feature.

I can agree that we drop other optional features like zone excursions
and the reset/finish recommended limit simulation, but PLEASE DO NOT
remove persistence and upstream a half-baked version when we are so
close and have time to get it right.
