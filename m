This is true.  The case I was playing with is where the QEMU APIs have a
more or less direct mapping to rust-vmm APIs and only have a limited
number of dependencies on other C APIs.  This way, you can either write
a Rust binding to the C code, or rewrite the C code in Rust with tiny C
wrapper APIs on top.

For example, the memory API (more or less) depends only on RCU and maps
to rust-vmm/vm-memory, and virtqueue processing in rust-vmm/vm-virtio
depends only on the memory API.

Thanks,

Paolo
