Yes, the whole function only works because it's used in this restricted
context today. For example, we only know that total_sectors is up to
date because the caller has called bdrv_getlength() just a moment ago.

I think fixing this would be beyond the scope of this patch, but
certainly a good idea anyway.

We're not in coroutine context, so we can't yield. I don't see who could
change the size in parallel (apart from an external process, but an
external process can mess up anything).

When we make backup-top an independent driver, instead of double
checking (what would you do on error?), maybe we could move the size
initialisation (then with bdrv_getlength()) to after
bdrv_child_refresh_perms().

Maybe this is a sign that bdrv_co_truncate shouldn't automatically skip
filters because filters might depend on a fixed size?

Or we could make the automatic skipping depend on having BLK_PERM_RESIZE
for the child. If the filter doesn't have the permission, we must not
call truncate for its child (it would crash). Then backup-top and
similar filters must just be careful not to take RESIZE permissions.
