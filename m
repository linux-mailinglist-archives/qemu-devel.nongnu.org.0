My understanding is that turning kvm-adjvtime either on or off
results in a different set of advantages and drawbacks, with neither
begin a one-size-fits-all solution. So it's good that we offer a way
for the user to pick one or the other based on their specific needs.

The main difference is that kvm-adjvtime=on matches x86's behavior,
which is fairly well understood and thoroughly documented, along with
the corresponding workarounds, dos and don'ts.

With that in mind, in my opinion it would make sense to make
kvm-adjvtime=on the behavior for newer machine types so that people
coming from an x86 background and/or having to manage both at the
same time will get a consistent experience and will be able to draw,
even for aarch64, on the considerable amount of existing x86-centric
literature on the subject.
