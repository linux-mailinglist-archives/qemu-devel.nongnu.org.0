Okay, that makes sense.

Yes, I agree that it is a bad thing.

Yes, that's what I had in mind, too.

Why we need to know if an image has been preallocated with zeroes or not?

Maybe when we convert it, but I'm not sure.

Seems like the better solution to me, also if I miss something why we need to
determine whether or not it's been pre-allocated. :-(


Thanks for very detailed answer,
