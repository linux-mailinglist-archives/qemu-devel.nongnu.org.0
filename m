In general libvirt should never use the psuedo-URI/URI syntax for
anything. We're moving towards use of blockdev, so will have the
dot separated key syntax on the cli and equiv in QMP.

I hope this means we'll stop using the URIs in migration, but will
defer to peter for specifics.

I always think it is a shame that QEMU has done so much work on
blockdev, but all QEMU's docs still largely use the many legacy
syntaxes. IOW, we should make these NBD examples use the modern
non-URI syntax too.
