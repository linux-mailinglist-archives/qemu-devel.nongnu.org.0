CI is a non-technical constraint, that's more about support level.

If we want to save CI minutes, we can declare that some or all of the
32-bit hosts scenarios are now tier 2, rather than tier 1. So the 32-bit
host support still exists, but we're not doing gating CI on every
combination. eg could declare 32-bit for linux-user is tier 1 and fully
tested but 32-bit machine emul is tier 2 and adhoc tested. Or make it
more nuanced per arch target

We only need to deprecate and delete if we have some wins at the code
level that we can't do with while it exists.

With regards,
Daniel
