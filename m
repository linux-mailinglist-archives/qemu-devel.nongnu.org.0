Its an obscure example, but we use it in scripts/oss-fuzz/build.sh to
build a qemu-fuzz binary(qemu-system with some bells and whistles) that
is portable between containers and can be deployed on oss-fuzz. The
other option is to build a static binary, which AFAIK is not supported
for softmmu builds.

I guess this is a prime example of "confusing and non-portable
weirdness".
In defense, it wasn't our idea. The oss-fuzz documentation suggests it:
