Yeah, it can be hard to get started.

What are your interests in programming/development, any specific types 
of coding you like doing more than others? What draws you to the QEMU in 
particular? Is there something you'd like to see QEMU do that it doesn't 
today, or something you feel like you are particularly suited to doing?

If I can figure out what brought you here, maybe I can direct you to 
some projects that might benefit from your attention. [Apart from the 
Python stuff, which we are discussing elsewhere in another thread.]

Some topic areas:

- Emulation (TCG)
- Virtualization (KVM)
- Esoteric/Legacy architecture/device emulation
- Optimization (Network, Storage, CPU)
- Regression/Acceptance Testing
- Fuzzing
- Configuration
- Deployment
- Continuous Integration
- Accessibility, Ease-of-use
- Build systems & tooling
- Development process
- SDK/API development


If you have any specific knowledge in areas that aren't Linux on x86, 
there are likely areas of QEMU that could benefit from your knowledge. 
We are always looking for people to help maintain and develop code 
intended for other architectures on other platforms.
