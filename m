Aren't hotplugged bridges ignored by essentially every guest OS in 
existence? (since it requires the entire topology to be rescanned, or 
something like that - forgive my lack of knowledge about the details, I 
just remember being told "that doesn't work")

libvirt does nothing with shpc. It uses the bridges with whatever is the 
default setting of shpc in qemu. I recall at one time someone (Marcel 
maybe?) proposed changing the default of that setting, but don't 
remember why.
