I won't be re-considering bitmaps, but arm is in need of better help text
for the cpu option. qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu help only produces a
list of available CPUs, which don't have descriptions. When checking '-cpu
help' on x86 we get descriptions, and we get another section "Recognized
CPUID flags". After this series is applied we could perhaps add a
"Recognized CPU features" section to arm's '-cpu help'. I don't intend
to do that myself, but I'll take a look at whatever you post :-)

Thanks,
