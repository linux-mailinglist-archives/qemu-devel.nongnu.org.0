Obviously, the last word on this belongs to Markus (CC'd) -- he added
that comment. I'd just like to point out *when* that comment was added:
approx. four and half years ago. (See commit 4629ed1e9896.)

I've always associated QERR_UNSUPPORTED with QMP interfaces rejecting
invocation due to lack of support. I don't think one more instance of
QERR_UNSUPPORTED will matter much, when we'll "finally" :) convert or
eliminate the other 35! (Yes, I've counted.)

In case it's unacceptable to add one more QERR_UNSUPPORTED: what is the
official solution that replaces it?

I assume it was explained in the series that included commit
4629ed1e9896, but I can't easily tell. (And, there is no "QERR_" match
in docs/.)

Hmmm, more history digging... In the 4629ed1e9896..v4.2.0-rc4 set of
commits, the following commits introduced new instances of
QERR_UNSUPPORTED:

- e09484efbc9d ("qmp: add QMP interface "query-cpu-model-expansion"", 2016-=
09-06)
- 0031e0d68339 ("qmp: add QMP interface "query-cpu-model-comparison"", 2016=
-09-06)
- b18b6043341d ("qmp: add QMP interface "query-cpu-model-baseline"", 2016-0=
9-06)
- 1007a37e2082 ("smbios: filter based on CONFIG_SMBIOS rather than TARGET",=
 2017-01-16)
- 9f57061c3555 ("acpi: filter based on CONFIG_ACPI_X86 rather than TARGET",=
 2017-01-16)
- 39164c136cba ("qmp/hmp: add query-vm-generation-id and 'info vm-generatio=
n-id' commands", 2017-03-02)
- 161a56a9065f ("qga: Add 'guest-get-users' command", 2017-04-26)
- 53c58e64d0a2 ("qga: Add `guest-get-timezone` command", 2017-04-27)
- e674605f9821 ("qemu-ga: check if utmpx.h is available on the system", 201=
7-07-17)

I don't claim that all of those additions have stuck with us, to
v4.2.0-rc4. Yet, in general, practice doesn't seem to have followed the
intended deprecation.

I think if we replace QERR_UNSUPPORTED with anything, it should be
"similarly standardized". (Lack of support for a given QMP interface is
pretty common, I think.)
