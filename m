Perhaps the spec should be relaxed to state that a client SHOULD=20
initiate soft disconnect (as there are existing clients that do not).=20
If a server knows it wants to initiate hard disconnect soon, it=20
shouldn't be forced to wait for a client to respond to NBD_ESHUTDOWN,=20
since not all clients do.  Then again, it is indeed nicer if the client=20
does initiate soft disconnect (as soft is always cleaner than hard).

With this patch as-is, qemu as client initiates hard disconnect in=20
response to NBD_ESHUTDOWN (but only if it plans on trying to reconnect).

qemu as server doesn't send NBD_ESHUTDOWN.  It probably should (the way=20
nbdkit does), but that's orthogonal to qemu as client responding to=20
NBD_ESHUTDOWN.
