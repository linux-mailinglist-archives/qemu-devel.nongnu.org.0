Adding an exec field would not be right, because QEMU can't simply be
launched from the desktop without any arguments. There needs to be a
long string of arguments given that are different for every QEMU that is
launched. The only viable way to actually launch QEMU is interactively
from the terminal, or indirectly via a 3rd party app like virt-manager.
We only created the qemu.desktop file in the first place because Wayland
needs this to be present in order to identify what Icon to display for a
window.

Title:
  /usr/share/applications/qemu.desktop should have an "Exec=3D" key.

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  According to the www.freedesktop.org .desktop-file specification, all
  "Application" desktop files should have an "Exec=3D" key. The one in
  qemu doesn't.

  This can be easily verified by running kbuildsycoca4 if KDE4 is
  present, but the issue is not DE-dependent.

  Which binary exactly should be assigned as the default one, I don't
  know.
