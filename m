Ah, I wasn't aware that this was supposed to be changed.

I don't even have the spec here for a floppy controller that supports
four drives. My copy has "reserved" for those bits that apparently refer
to the additional drives (if the QEMU code is right).

Sorry for not being clear. This isn't about criticism at all. I just
wanted to suggest that if you're trying to find out how to model new
devices, looking at floppy is probably a better start than looking at
most other block devices.

I don't know the floppy emulation well enough to say much about the
MAX_FD == 4 case, but the basic separation into controller and drive,
and that removable media are not represented in qdev, but just as block
nodes inserted into the BlockBackend of the drive, feels like the right
approach.

I think the most important part to fix in the commit message would be
the confusion between drives and disks.
