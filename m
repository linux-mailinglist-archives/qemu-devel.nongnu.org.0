As you can see from that diagram, the history ppc CPUs is quite a bit
more diverse than x86.  Although they're all very similar from the
point of view of userspace code, they're quite different for
privileged kernel code: they have different MMUs, different privileged
registers amongst other things.

Because of this there are several different KVM implementations.

1) KVM HV

This one uses the virtualization facilities of BookS CPUs (present
since POWER4 / 970, but only well supported from POWER7 onwards).
Those don't allow much to virtualize the guest cpu model, so it
assumes the guest cpu is the same as the host.

So, both your guest and host CPUs rule this one out.

2) Book3E KVM

Uses the virtualization features of recent enough Freescale Book E
CPUs.  I don't know a lot about this or its limitations.  The e6500
might well have these features, but I'm pretty sure it can only
emulate BookE cpus for the guest.

So, your guest rules this one out.

3) KVM PR

This one operates by running the entire guest in user mode, and
emulating all privileged instructions.  It's slow (relative to
hardware assisted KVM models), but it's flexible.

In theory, this one can do what you want, but there are a bunch of
caveats:

  * Emulating all the privileged instructions for a whole bunch of cpu
  variants is a huge task, and KVM PR is now barely maintained.  There
  are lots of gaps in coverage.

  * I'm not sure if it was ever really implemented for BookE hosts.

  * Although there aren't many, there are a few differences between
  userland instructions between cpu variants, mostly because of new
  additions.  I think 7457 is an old enough design that this probably
  won't cause you troube, but I'm not certain.
