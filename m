Good catch..  Indeed I overlooked that as well when reviewing the code.

The problem is even if the page is read-only, it does not yet have the uffd-wp
bit set, so it won't really trigger the handle_userfault() path.

So I think what's missing for live snapshot is indeed to register with both
missing & wp mode.

Then we'll receive two messages: For wp, we do like before.  For missing, we do
UFFDIO_ZEROCOPY and at the same time dump this page as a zero page.

I bet live snapshot didn't encounter this issue simply because normal live
snapshots would still work, especially when there's the guest OS. Say, the
worst case is we could have migrated some zero pages with some random data
filled in along with the snapshot, however all these pages were zero pages and
not used by the guest OS after all, then when we load a snapshot we won't
easily notice either..

Thanks,
