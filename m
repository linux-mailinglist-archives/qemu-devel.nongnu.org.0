Why?  The only difference with "normal" behavior and socket activation
is who creates the socket and calls listen() on it.  Everything else is
entirely the same.

Yes, that is why I thought the socket could be moved in advance to the
right security label, prior to exec.  Also, perhaps could the child move
itself to the right cgroup before dropping privileges.  This would
remove the window between 3 and 5, by moving all the work *before*
qemu-pr-helper is exec-ed.
