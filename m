I=E2=80=99ve been trying to make this work, but I don=E2=80=99t think it do=
es.  It just
feels all wrong and I need up with things like
=E2=80=9Cchild_metadata_and_data=E2=80=9D.  The last straw was that blkveri=
fy should
have the raw file be the filtered child (because, well, it=E2=80=99s bs->fi=
le),
but then the format file would need to be a non-filtered child, and
those would default to BDRV_O_PROTOCOL (which we decidedly don=E2=80=99t wa=
nt).

Anyway, I=E2=80=99m currently attempting to solve this differently:
BdrvChildRole isn=E2=80=99t suitable for the job, I think.  The name is
completely what we want, but it actually doesn=E2=80=99t look like somethin=
g
that describes the child role to me.

Instead, I=E2=80=99m introducing a new BdrvChildRole enum mask that describ=
es
how the child is going to be used: stay-at-node, cow, metadata, data, etc.

I=E2=80=99m going to rename the current BdrvChildRole structure to
BdrvChildParent (in want of a better name), because really most of what
it does is describe the parent, but precisely not the child.  I=E2=80=99m m=
oving
.stay_as_node to the new BdrvChildRole enum.

I hope this lets me unify child_file, child_backing, and child_format
into a child_of_bds object.  The callbacks should then decide the
particularities based on the BdrvChildRole enum.

Hope that makes sense. (? :S)

At least I feel much happier implementing it this way, which I suppose
is a good sign.

Max
