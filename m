Hi,

Google recently announced their 'Season of Docs' project:
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs

QEMU project seems to fit all the requirements.

Who is interested in [co-]mentoring?

Relevant links:
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/admin-guide
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline

[Following is extracted from the previous links:]

Example projects:

* Build a documentation site on a platform to be decided
   by the technical writer and open source mentor, and publish
   an initial set of basic documents on the site. Examples of
   platforms include:

   - A static site generator such as Hugo, Jekyll, Sphinx, ...

* Refactor the open source project's existing documentation to
   provide an improved user experience or a more accessible
   information architecture.

* Write a conceptual overview of, or introduction to, a product
   or feature. Often a team creates their technical documentation
   from the bottom up, with the result that there's a lot of
   detail but it's hard to understand the product as a whole. A
   technical writer can fix this.

* Create a tutorial for a high-profile use case.

* Create a set of focused how-to guides for specific tasks.

* Create a contributor=E2=80=99s guide that includes basic information
   about getting started as a contributor to the open source
   project, as well as any rules around licence agreements,
   processes for pull requests and reviews, building the project,
   and so on.

Previous experience with similar programs, such as Google Summer
of Code or others: If you or any of your mentors have taken part
in Google Summer of Code or a similar program, mention this in
your application. Describe your achievements in that program.
Explain how this experience may influence the way you work in
Season of Docs.

The 2020 season of Season of Docs is limited to a maximum of
50 technical writing projects in total.
As a guideline, we expect to accept a maximum of 2 projects
per organization, so that we don't end up with too many
accepted projects. However, if the free selection process
doesn't fill all the slots, the Google program administrators
may allocate additional slots to some organizations.
