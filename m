Yes, sorry, I noticed this only later (it's how review goes when a move
is split into a copy in one patch and a removal later). I don't insist
on a change if you prefer to have a clean copy.

It's probably easy to agree that this is a bug.

This was actually my thought as well. And in order to propagate, we have
to copy the option from parent_options, no? Currently it will always be
disabled (unless specified explicitly for the node) because that's the
default setting for unmap.

This would restore the behaviour before this series for child_file and
child_format. It would be different in that it also enables "unmap" for
backing files, which should be okay.

Isn't it relevant for zero writes during active commit? (The "normal"
intermediate commit job doesn't even try to optimise zero blocks...)

The job will have its own BdrvChild to access the node, but option
inheritance happens only from the parent that "owns" the backing file,
so if a qcow2 image doesn't set "unmap" on its COW child, unmap will be
disabled for the active commit job, too.

(Oops. Turns out that it's not the case because the 'unmap' option for
the job exists only for drive-mirror. blockdev-mirror passes true
unconditionally and block-commit passes false unconditionally. I'm
always amazed how consistently we fail to be consistent.

But I think using zero writes with MAY_UNMAP in a commit job is an
obvious extension, so considering it now can't hurt anyway.)
