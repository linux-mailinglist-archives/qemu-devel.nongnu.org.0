The optional nature of virtio-rng is something that results in the
the same problems for Linux.

If virtio-rng is absent, then Linux now has a general purpose fallback
via the CPU timing jitter entropy source:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?=
id=3Dbb5530e4082446aac3a3d69780cd4dbfa4520013

Is it practical to provide a jitter entropy source for EDK2
too ?

If we can guarantee we always present fallback like jitterentropy
then the problem with TLS init goes away IIUC.
