Agreed.  However, note that the audience for deprecation
information is not just developers and support people.  End users
need to know when they are relying on a deprecated feature, and
applications should make it as easy as possible for them to
update their configurations.

I'm not suggesting the alternative would be applied
automatically.  But having the alternative available in a
machine-friendly way may be the difference between a unhelpful UI
that just tells the user there's some problem but can't give a
solution, and one that can really assist the user to fix the
problem.
