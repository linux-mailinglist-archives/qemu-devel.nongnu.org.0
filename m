Okay. I wish the nvme twg would strip the changelog from the published
TPs. We have unhelpful statements like this in the ZNS spec:

  "Default active zones to transition to Closed state on power/controller reset."

That can't be right. The ZNS spec says:

  The initial state of a zone state machine is set as a result of:
    a) an NVM Subsystem Reset; or
    b) all controllers in the NVM subsystem reporting Shutdown
       processing complete ((i.e., 10b in the Shutdown Status (SHST)
       register)

So a CC.SHN had better cause an implicit transition of open zones to
their "initial" state since 'open' is not a valid initial state.
