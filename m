I need to have another look at this but from memory it is because the
"cross-build" approach they use is to try and build all arches with a
qemu-user controlled docker build. However if the host architecture is
the target you are aiming for that should run normally - however it
failed on qemu-test because you can't build the armhf binaries there as
not all AArch64 machines support AArch32. There is a bug in the Debian
binfmt_misc scripts that I raised but needs proper fixing.

I think the easiest thing to do would be to document how to build
exactly 1 architecture at a time so you don't have to succeed in
building everything at once and can build something natively without
jumping through hoops.

Much as I champion qemu-user for solving build problems I think being
able to build natively should be the quicker and easier fix (not that we
shouldn't fix qemu-user bugs as well).
