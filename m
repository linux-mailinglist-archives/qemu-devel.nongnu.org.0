The QEMU project is currently considering to move its bug tracking to anoth=
er system. For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which co=
uld be closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.
If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch the st=
ate back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report will be ma=
rked as "Expired". Or mark it as "Fix Released" if the problem has been sol=
ved with a newer version of QEMU already. Thank you and sorry for the incon=
venience.

Title:
  QEMU 2.12 Running Problem in Windows 7 Installation

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  QEMU Version: 2.12 (Binary installer qemu-w64-setup-20180424.exe  from St=
efan Weil's website so I am not sure I should report it to Weil by email or=
 by this bug report system.)
  Host System: Windows 7 64bit
  Guest System: 9front 6350 (Codename=E2=80=9CCONTENTS, MAINTAINED, STABLE=
=E2=80=9D, Release 2018/02/02)

  QEMU Command:
  qemu-system-x86_64 -usb -device usb-mouse -hda plan9.qcow2.img -cdrom 9fr=
ont-6350.iso -boot d

  QEMU warning: =

  (qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): GdkPixbuf-WARNING **: Cannot open pixbuf l=
oader module file 'D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.cache': No suc=
h file or directory

  This likely means that your installation is broken.
  Try running the command
    gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > D:\qemu\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0\2.10.0\loaders.ca=
che
  to make things work again for the time being.

  (qemu-system-x86_64.exe:8844): Gtk-WARNING **: Could not find the icon 'w=
indow-minimize-symbolic-ltr'. The 'hicolor' theme was not found either, per=
haps you need to install it.
