Do we need anything complex in relocation handler, though?
=46rom what I'd imagine, minimum handler should
  1: get address of TSEG, possibly read it from chipset
  2: calculate its new SMBASE offset based on its APIC ID
  3: save new SMBASE

07b - implies 08b
   8b could be trivial hlt loop and we most likely could skip 08a and signa=
ling host CPU steps
   but we need INIT/SIPI/SIPI sequence to wake up AP so it could handle pen=
ding SMI
   before handling SIPI (so behavior would follow SDM).

So far we should be able to implement it per spec (at least SDM one),
but we would still need to invent chipset hardware
i.e. like adding to Q35 non exiting SMRAM and means to map/unmap it
to non-SMM address space.
(and I hope we could avoid adding "parked CPU" thingy)

We can serialize it (for normal hotplug flow) from ACPI handler
in the guest (i.e. non enforced serialization).
The only reason for serialization I see is not to allow
a bunch of new CPU trample over default SMBASE save area
at the same time.

There is a consideration though, an OS level attacker
could send broadcast SMI and INIT-SIPI-SIPI sequences
to rigger race, but I don't see it as a threat since
attack shouldn't be able to exploit anything and in
worst case guest OS would crash (taking in account that
SMIs are privileged, OS attacker has a plenty of other
means to kill itself).
