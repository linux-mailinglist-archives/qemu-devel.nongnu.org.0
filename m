The first thing to address is the HOMER XSCOM region. 

Introduce an empty skeleton for P8 and P9 with different mem ops handers
because the registers have a different layout. From there, add the support
for the different PBA* regs and move them out from the default XSCOM
handlers. That should fix most of the current problems and it will provide 
a nice framework for future extensions.

Why not add the associated HOMER MMIO region while we are it ? the PBA
registers have all the definitions we need and it will gives us access
to the pstate table.


Second is the OCC region. Do we need a XSCOM *or* a MMIO region ? This is 
not clear. Please check skiboot. I think a MMIO region should be enough
because this is how sensor data from the OCC is accessed. 

On that topic, we could define properties on the PnvOCC model for each 
sensor and tune the value from the QEMU monitor. It really shouldn't be
too complex.

Also the same address is used, we should only map it once but we need 
to invent something to know from which chip it is accessed.
