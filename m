It seems this might be related to buffer/sample size,  spice works and uses=
 timed audio with a larger buffer. =

GUS I have not gotten to work.

Title:
  qemu git && 4.2:  timed audio issues with sb16,  gus not working?

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  =

  I have built [both] current git, and 4.2.0, there are issues with audio/s=
oundhw for both.

  Specifics:

  Linux nullrig 5.3.0-24-generic #26-Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov 14 01:33:18 UTC
  2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

  Out of source build, successful for both:

  ../configure --prefix=3D/opt/qemu --target-list=3Di386-softmmu,mips64el-
  softmmu ---enable-sdl --enable-sdl-image --enable-lzo --enable-bzip2
  --enable-avx2 --enable-kvm --enable-membarrier --enable-plugin

  Call:

  ./qemu -machine pc,accel=3Dkvm,usb=3Doff -cpu pentium -m 64 -rtc
  base=3Dlocaltime -parallel none -soundhw sb16,adlib,pcspk -device
  cirrus-vga,bus=3Dpci.0 -drive
  id=3Ddisk1,file=3Ddoom.cow,format=3Dqcow2,if=3Dvirtio -audiodev pa,id=3Dpa

  Audio for sb16 sounds ok,  however if i switch to a timer based audio:
  -audiodev wav

  The output is wrong..  I had assumed it was all timer based audio,
  however it seems to be limited to sb16.

  So I then tried the next popular/compatible audio device for dos
  games:  gravis ultrasound [gus].

  I get no output at all for it.
  I have tried more than one piece of software,  DOOM shareware is any easy=
 example.

  I realize there are better solutions for playing DOS games, however I
  am interested in snapshot support which many of them lack.

  I am willing to put the work into fixing it myself if need be,
  however i'm not very familiar with the audio backend.   Specifically,
  it is already mixed into a single buffer,  if 'adlib' driver is
  already working: (audio_pcm_ops.write() output is correct on timer
  based output) I failed to see how it affects emulation of the sound
  blaster.
