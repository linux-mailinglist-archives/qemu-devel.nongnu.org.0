The only mechanism is to design the workload in the Guest in a way that
it can't do anything meaningful until the secret is injected, and the
Attestation Server will release the secret only if a proper attestation
report is presented.

James (cc'd) wants to move this attestation check as early as possible
--> "to restrict what can be done before attestation is complete".
