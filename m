yep, I'll try to use full syntax since so it would be clear to others.

I didn't know about query-machines, hence implemented "qom-list-properties"
approach as was discussed at https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel@nongnu.org/msg601220.html

For the purpose of deprecating '-numa node,mem" query-machines is more than
enough. I'll drop 1-3 patches and respin series using query-machines.

Perhaps there will in future use cases when introspecting 'defaults'
of objects will be needed, then we could look back into qom-list-properties
if there aren't a better alternative.
