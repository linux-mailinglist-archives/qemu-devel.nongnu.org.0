virtio-pci uses it for 'disable-legacy'.

To me, on/off/auto sounds like a reasonable thing to do.

What possibilities of 'user error' do you see? Shouldn't we fence off
misconfigurations, if the consequences would be disastrous?

"Unpack facility in cpu model" means "guest may transition into pv
mode", right? What does it look like when the guest actually has
transitioned?

I don't think we'd want to migrate between pv and non-pv anyway?

This really needs more comments, as it is not obvious to the casual
reader. (I also stumbled over the resets.)

But I wonder whether we are actually missing those subsystems resets
today?
