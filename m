I suspect the reason that x86.c has always had those hardcoded offsets
is because this is how it's documented in Documentation/x86/boot.rst?

62 is intentional. But I'm still not really sure what's up. 63 doesn't
work. I haven't totally worked out why this is, or why the 64 MiB limit
exists in the first place. Maybe because this is a very early mapping
set up by real mode? Or because another mapping is placed over it that's
executable? There's that 2MiB*4096 gdt entry, but that'd cover all 4
gigs. So I really don't know yet. I'll continue to poke at it, but on
the off chance somebody here understands what's up, that'd save me a
bunch of head scratching.

> Fix looks good, glad you figured out the problem.

I mean, kind of. The solution here sucks, especially given that in the
worst case, setup_data just gets dropped. I'm half inclined to consider
this a kernel bug instead, and add some code to relocate setup_data
prior to decompression, and then fix up all the links. It seems like
this would be a lot more robust.

I just wish the people who wrote this stuff would chime in. I've had
x86@kernel.org CC'd but so far, no input from them.
