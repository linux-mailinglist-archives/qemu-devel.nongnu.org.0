It would be nice to have that patch as part of the same series, but it 
has already been posted to the list separately, so I'm okay with this 
series as just doc word-smithing while we get that patch series in soon.

Why must the compression_type field be non-zero?  If this bit is set, an 
older qemu cannot use the image, regardless of the contents of the 
compression_type field, so for maximum back-compat, a sane app will 
never set this bit when compression_type is zero.  But there is nothing 
technically wrong with setting this bit even when compression_type is 0, 
and newer qemu would still manage to use the image correctly with zlib 
compression if it were not for this arbitrary restriction.

Ragged edge formatting looks awkward.  Either this is one paragraph 
("type.  If") or there should be a blank line to make it obvious there 
are two paragraphs.

I'm still not sure I agree with the mandate that the field must be 
non-zero when the incompatible feature bit is set.
