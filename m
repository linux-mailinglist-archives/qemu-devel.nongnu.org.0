For the case I care about (long running virt-v2v conversions with an
intermittent network) we don't expect that nbdkit will be killed nor
gracefully shut down.  Instead what we expect is that nbdkit returns
an error such as NBD_EIO and keeps running.

Indeed if nbdkit actually dies then reconnecting will not help since
there will be no server to reconnect to.

So I'm neutral about this patch.  If you want it for qemu that's fine
but I don't think it will affect v2v.

Rich.
