My launcher is part of our container environment.  But I also use libvirt, and scripts.
Putting the hook inside qemu makes it work for all environments.

The V2 patch uses your SIGSTOP idea (which you previously suggested to me, thanks), but I found that
by fiddling with signal masks, I could make the handshake easier for the user.  See the example in the 
V2 patch message, versus the example I just sent in my last email.
