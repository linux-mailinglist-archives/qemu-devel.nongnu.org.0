Title:
  mips linux-user builds occasionly crash randomly only to be fixed by a
  full clean re-build

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  From time to time I find check-tcg crashes with a one of the MIPS
  binaries. The last time it crashed was running the test:

    ./mips64el-linux-user/qemu-mips64el ./tests/tcg/mips64el-linux-
  user/threadcount

  Inevitably after some time noodling around wondering what could be
  causing this weird behaviour I wonder if it is a build issue. I wipe
  all the mips* build directories, re-run configure and re-build and
  voila problem goes away.

  It seems there must be some sort of build artefact which isn't being
  properly re-generated on a build update which causes weird problems.
  Additional data point if I:

    rm -rf mips64el-linux-user
    ../../configure
    make

  then I see failures in mip32 builds - eg:

      GEN     mipsn32el-linux-user/config-target.h
    In file included from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/syscall_defs.=
h:10,
                     from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/qemu.h:16,
                     from /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/linuxload.c:5:
    /home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/linux-user/mips64/syscall_nr.h:1: error: unter=
minated #ifndef
     #ifndef LINUX_USER_MIPS64_SYSCALL_NR_H

    make[1]: *** [/home/alex/lsrc/qemu.git/rules.mak:69: linux-user/linuxlo=
ad.o] Error 1
    make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....

  which implies there is a cross dependency between different targets
  somewhere. If I executed:

    rm -rf mips*

  before re-configuring and re-building then everything works again.
