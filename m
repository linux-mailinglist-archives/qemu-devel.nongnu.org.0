All right, I *was* afraid of that, but I guess it was worth a try anyway.
So I think I'll keep that patch that adds few missing memsets,=20
just to consistency/documentation purposes since anyway
in addtion to these there are lot of other places that keys are kept,
like the ciphers itself, secrets (which aren't even freed  usually
as long as VM is running)

The purpose was that I just that memsetting caught my eye and
I wanted to make it at least consistent.

Thanks for the review,
