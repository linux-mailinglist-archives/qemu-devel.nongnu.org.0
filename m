If an end-user feature works only in in-tree builds (so, explitely said:
not in out-of-tree builds), this is not a build-time stuff, but user-facing
feature issue.

If someone is keen on removing any feature (as is truly in this case), I
expect at least some moderate investigation being done on what could be
affected (prior to announcing deprecation), rather than attitude "ok, let's
announce deprecation, see if someone start clamoring, and, if not, we are
good to go with removing". For me, this slightly disappointing.

I haven't seen anyone doing a sufficiently thourough analysis on what
happens without in-tree builds, and doesn't work in out-of-tree builds in a
proper way.

But, ok, this is just my opinion, probably unpopular within dev comunity,
since it requires additional effort by us. Still, we should guide ourself
with "what is right to do", and not "what is easy to do" principles.

Regards,
Aleksandar
