Ack, just wanted to make sure I understood the implications correctly.

I'm still not sure I fully understand why we hit this problem (i.e.,
ZFR0 enumeration mismatch between host and guest) in the first place,
unless I've misunderstood which patches make these changes, or unless
RHEL has cherry-picked odd patches that weren't intended to be applied
separately...
