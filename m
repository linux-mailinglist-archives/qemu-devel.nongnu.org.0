Implicit in that statement though is that libvirt will not be able
to make use of the QAPI code generator as proposed though. If we are
designing something to make our application consumer's lives easier,
but we exclude such a major application, is our solution actually
a good one.

To help us understand, I'll illustrate some possible interfaces
in both Go and Python, since that covers dynamic and static
languages

> * Initially, it has a mandatory argument @device[*].

Python definition:

   def block_resize(device, size)

Caller:

  block_resize('dev0', 1*GiB)


Golang definition

   type BlockResizeCommand struct {
       Device string
       Size int
   }

Caller

   cmd := &BlockResizeCommand{
       Device: "dev0",
       Size: 1 * GiB,
   }

Python definition. Tricky, as non-optional params must be before
optional params, but size is naturally the last arg. One option
is to pointlessly mark 'size' as optional

   def block_resize(device=None, node_name=None, size=None)

Caller

    block_resize(device="dev0", size=1*GiB)
    block_resize(node_name="devnode0", size=1*GiB)


In golang definition

   type BlockResizeArguments struct {
       Device string
       NodeName string
       Size int
   }

Caller choice of

   cmd := &BlockResizeCommand{
       Device: "dev0",
       Size: 1 * GiB,
   }

   cmd := &BlockResizeCommand{
       NodeName: "devnode0",
       Size: 1 * GiB,
   }


Neither case can easily prevent passing Device and NodeName
at same time.

Ok, no change needed to the APIs in either case. Possibly have
code emit a warning if a deprecated field is set.

Again no change needed to APIs, but QEMU will throw back an
error if the wrong one is used.

Yep, I think that's inevitable in this scenario. THe plus side
is that apps that want to span versions can do so. The downside
is that apps that don't want smarts to span version, may loose
compile time warnings about use of the now deleted field. 

I suggested the code generator have an option to say what level
of compat to use for generated code, so that apps can request an
API without compat, which will result in compile errors. This
though assumes every consumer app is embedding their own
generated copy of the code. Not neccessarily desirable.

At the C level you can play games with __deprecated__ to get
compile time warnings in some cases. 

#define GLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED GLIB_VERSION_2_56

causes QEMU to get compile time warnings (or errors) if it
attempts to use a API feature deprecated in 2.56, even if
the API exists in the header & library.

I've not thought through all possible scenarios, but there may end
up being restrictions, such that changes that were previously possible
may have to be forbidden.

One example,  in the past we could do deprecate a field 'foo', then
delete 'foo' and then some time re-introduce 'foo' with a completely
different type. That would not be possible if we wanted to maintain
compat, but in this example that's probably a good thing, as it'll
be super confusing to have the same field name change type like that
over time. Easier to just use a different name.

So the question to me is not whether all our previous changes are
still possible, but whether enough of the typwes of change are
possible, such that we can cope with the ongoing maint in a
reasonable way. I don't think we've explored the possibility enough
to say one way or the other.

The premise of the code generators is that there are applications
that want to consume QEMU that are not libvirt. With this line of
reasoning we could easily say that all such applications should
just use libvirt and then we don't need to provide any of these
code generators.  The fact that we're considering these code
generators though, says that we're accepting there are valid use
cases that don't want to use libvirt for whatever reasons. It is
reasonable that some of those applications may wish to target
a wide range of QEMU versions, just like libvirt does.

It is also reasonable to say that libvirt would be better off if
it could auto-generate a client API for QEMU too, instead of
writing it by hand from a human reading the QAPI

Daniel
