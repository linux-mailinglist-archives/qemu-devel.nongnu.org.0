The trouble is .instance_init() can do anything, and can therefore
interact badly with anything.

Example: m2sxxx_soc_initfn() of device type "msf2-soc" messes with
nd_table[0].  That's wrong.  The test doesn't catch it with machine type
"none", where nd_table[0] is blank.  It does catch it with machine type
"ast2600-evb", because aspeed_machine_init() puts something incompatible
into nd_table[0], which makes m2sxxx_soc_initfn() crash.

"msf2-soc" is not a PCI device, but if it was, then the two machines
(with and without PCI) picked for testing PCI devices may well both
leave nd_table[0] blank, and therefore not catch the bug.

Some instances of "device code does stuff it should not" could be
prevented by making interfaces inaccessible there.  We'd have to
identify device code first.  The hw/BASE-ARCH/ contain both boards and
devices.  Possibly even in the same .c.

Hunch: when we want to test device instantiation and finalization for a
million (give or take) combinations of board x device, testing them one
by one with QMP might be a bad idea.
