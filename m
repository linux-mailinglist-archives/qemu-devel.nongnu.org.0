The QEMU project is currently moving its bug tracking to another system.
For this we need to know which bugs are still valid and which could be
closed already. Thus we are setting older bugs to "Incomplete" now.

If you still think this bug report here is valid, then please switch
the state back to "New" within the next 60 days, otherwise this report
will be marked as "Expired". Or please mark it as "Fix Released" if
the problem has been solved with a newer version of QEMU already.

Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience.

Title:
  Multiple (Repeating) Keystrokes in macOS

Status in QEMU:
  Incomplete

Bug description:
  Hi,

  I am finding this issue with v4.2.0, or the latest master - on a
  Windows host, with macOS guest. It happens using gtk (SPICE?) or VNC.
  When I get to a place to enter a keystroke, I quite reliably get
  multiple of the same key (i.e. press A, get AAAA).

  Thinking there may be a basic setting to address this? I did try it in
  Linux (kvm), no issue there.

  Thanks!
