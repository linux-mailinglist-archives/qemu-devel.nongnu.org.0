Would there ever be scope for a plain MMIO style device to be reported?
While I agree PCI is pretty useful from the point of view of easy
discovery I note a number of machine types prefer device tree reported
devices because they are faster to bring up for cloudy fast VM purposes
(c.f. microvm).

There doesn't seem to be any mention of limits on the output section
size. If you wanted to limit visibility between peers there would have
to be an explicit page alignment requirement for these sections.

Or would the alternative be for the hypervisor to instantiate additional
IVSHMEM devices for each combination of peers that need visibility of
each other?

Sorry I don't follow - if there is no BAR2 there is still a shared
memory region but you just can't move it around the guests address
space? I guess this ties in with my question above about capabilities,
is there just a value you read for the physical address? What about it's
size?

ah so we follow Capability Pointer and then walk down the table in Next
Capability chunks? Next Capability is described as a pointer but only at
an offset of 01h with Length at 02h. Is it really a pointer or just the
size of this capability record?

I think this answers the question further up - no BAR2 and the optional
Base Address in the Vendor Specific Capability.

This seems useful - especially in the case of trying to keep the guest
using a fixed guest physical address and not potentially breaking up
mappings in the hypervisor by moving stuff around.

Otherwise it reads fine to me.  I'm sure some of my confusion is from
not being familiar with the details of PCI devices.
