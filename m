The reason I went for "inverted" property is because, we can specify this for gpios at provider side.

The usecase needed to define the polarity which did not have kernel space consumer driver.


I am not sure how do we achieve this using GPIO_INVERTED flag. We need some sort of node/gpio-hog to specify these

type of properties? Otherwise gpio-pin will be held by kernel or the module using the hog property and the user space application will not be able to access pin.


or please let me know if I am missing something.

Things will work without GPIO_INVERTED flag for consumers which can specify GPIO_ACTIVE_* flags.
