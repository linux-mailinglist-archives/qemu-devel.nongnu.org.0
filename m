In the approach where vfio-user terminates in the device VMM and the
device guest uses a new virtio-vhost-user style device we can continue
to use AF_UNIX with file descriptor passing on the host. The vfio-user
protocol doesn't need to be extended like it would for AF_VSOCK/AF_INET.

   Driver guest                              Device guest
        ^                                         ^
	| PCI device             virtio-vfio-user |
	v                                         v
    Driver VMM  <---- vfio-user AF_UNIX ----> Device VMM

It does not require changing the vfio-user protocol because the driver
VMM is talking to a regular vfio-user device process that happens to be
the device VMM.

The trick is that the device VMM makes the shared memory accessible as
VIRTIO shared memory regions (already in the VIRTIO spec) and eventfds
as VIRTIO doorbells/interrupts (proposed by not yet added to the VIRTIO
spec). This allows the device guest to directly access these resources
so it can DMA to the driver guest's RAM, inject interrupts, and receive
doorbell notifications.
