It's forbidden, actually.  The QMP handler must either succeed and
return a value, or fail cleanly.

Since it has to return a value even when it fails, it returns an error
value then.  "Cleanly" means the error value does not require cleanup.

The generated marshalling function relies on this: it *ignores* the
error value.

Correct.

This is more complicated than it may seem.

The "natural" error value for a pointer-valued function is NULL.  I'm
confident the handlers use it.  assert(!retval) should work.

For functions returning something else, people may have different ideas
on what to return on error.  To make assert(!retval) work, they need to
return something "falsish".  I'm not ready to bet my own money on all of
them doing that.

Aside: only functions in pragma returns-whitelist can return
non-pointer.

No clean way exists, simply because there has been no need.  So far,
we've always found a reasonable way to generate code that works whether
types are pointers in C or not.

Method c_name() returns a string you can interpolate into C identifiers.

Method c_type() returns a string you can use as C type in generated
code.

The QAPI scripts could use more comments.
