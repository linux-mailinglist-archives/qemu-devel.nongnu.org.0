Phew, that's a pretty huge patch, could you maybe split it by subsystem /
folder so that it is easier to review?

I'm not sure whether we should update the version in the files that just say
"LGPL" (and do not mention "Lesser") ... they could also refer to the GNU
*Library* GPL instead, which was available as version 2 (in the sense of 2.0).
Could you please drop the hunks for the files that only mention LGPL for now?

That's an interesting file - the license text shows up twice here... I
wonder whether we could scratch one of the two... but that's also something
for a separate patch, I think.
