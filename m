Right.  But (as described below) if you want to know the status a
specific feature you already know about (even if you are using
the old spelling), qom-get should work for you.

The goal of filtered-features and unavailable-features is to
catch all the rest: features you might not know about, but that
should prevent a CPU model from running.

Right.  My goal here is to replace filtered-features, not
feature-words.

For the use case you describe here, qom-get sounds better than
using feature-words, yes.
