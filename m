This is indeed write operation. Paulo helped me to finally understand
what RCU guarantees are, so now I understand.

About write locking here (which I also understand now that I need for RCU),
this is very good question if that can race as well:

It looks like qdev_unplug is what does the device removal, and it first
calls the hotplug handler which is supposed to unrealize the device,
in addition to whatever hot unplug actions are needed (like informing the guest),
and then it does object_unparent which removes the device from the bus.
Therefore as long as the .realized store is atomic and with proper barriers,
the scsi IO thread might be able to see the device but it will be unplugged by then.


There are plenty of object_unparent calls through the code base and I can only hope
that these are done with big qemu lock held.

I agree, however this is existing bug - bus_remove_child was dropping this
reference immediatly and I delayed it to RCU callback it now sets.
So I didn't made the situation worse.

In scsi_device_find, as long as RCU read lock is held, no RCU reclaim should happen,
thus this code shouldn't have the child disapper under it.
However once scsi_device_find returns, indeed this can happen,

so scsi_device_find should indeed take a reference to the scsi device and the caller should
drop it when not needed. That should be done in a separate patch, and it
might open yet another can of worms.
While at it, it should be renamed scsi_device_get()
Maybe keep both scsi_device_find and scsi_device_get(), and let the legacy drivers
continue using the former one, while make virtio-scsi use the later?

I removed the RCU read lock here, under assumption that
bus_remove_child will be called with BQL held.
I kept the _RCU version of the list removal, under assumption that
writer still needs it to avoid race vs readers.

Same as above.

Assuming that you are not joking here, I'll add this in the new version of the patches.

This is on purpose - I didn't convert to RCU most of the drivers
which don't have this race versus iothread after a discussion with Paulo,
and this is one of them. Virtio bus has only one device
and it is added right away on initialization and vise-versa of the parent
(aka virtio-pci/virtio-mmio) bus device.

I will revert the other cosmetic changes in this function which I did when
I wasn't sure if to use _RCU version here.
