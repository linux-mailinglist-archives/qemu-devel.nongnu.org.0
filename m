Allocating from guest ram would work most of the time, but I think
it's insufficient for many use cases. It doesn't really support things
such as contiguous allocations, allocations from carveouts or <4GB,
protected buffers, etc.

What exactly do you mean by application?

Is this approach expected to handle allocating buffers with
hardware-specific constraints such as stride/height alignment or
tiling? Or would there need to be some alternative channel for
determining those values and then calculating the appropriate buffer
size?
