Hmm.. add "bool frozen_only_warn" field to BdrvChild and print warning
instead of fail where c->frozen cause failure?

I can make a patch, if you don't think that its too much.

Actually, we already done so once:

Freezing of base was introduced in 4.0, when c624b015bf comes in 4.1
(there were no real user bugs or feature requests, it was just my [bad]
idea, related to the problem around our stream-filter and parallel
jobs in iotest 30).
So, at least for 4.0 we had frozen base.. Were there any bugs?
But now we live with not-frozen base for several releases..

Yes, let's start with it.

I think we can just deprecate, and not add the bottom-node. If someone
will come during deprecation period and say that he have such use-case,
we'll add @bottom-node. Otherwise we'll just start to freeze base node
again.
