I admit the "legacy" bit is still aspirational.  We still haven't
managed to replace it for configuring certain onboard devices.

The thing being configured is a device's BlockBackend.

To understand the point I'm trying to make, please ignore "legacy", and
focus on the actual purpose of DriveInfo: it's (one kind of) user
configuration for a BlockBackend.

Now let me try to state the problem you're trying to solve.  Instead of
special-casing "no backend" in device code like pflash_cfi0?.c do, you
want to make up a "dummy" backend instead.  You need the dummy to read
some blank value and ignore writes.  One of the null block drivers
should fit the bill.

Now my point.  Why first make up user configuration, then use that to
create a BlockBackend, when you could just go ahead and create the
BlockBackend?

Sadly, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the block API anymore to tell
you exactly how.  blk_new_with_bs() looks promising.  Perhaps Kevin can
advise.
