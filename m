That's what I've meant by it should be reimplemented eventually to fix al=
l=20
possible problems but could not do that before 5.0. Since this is existin=
g=20
bug ever since this device is first committed not patching it now is=20
probably not a big deal if this is not considered a security problem. (An=
d=20
if it is then all the abort() calls are probably a problem too although=20
less serious.)

Does that make it even slower than it is already? I think it should rathe=
r=20
be changed to do what I've done in ati_2d.c and call optimised functions=20
to do the blit operation instead of implementing it directly. Then we'll=20
need checking parameters to avoid overflows. I may try to do that=20
eventually but don't know when will I have time for that so if there's=20
anyone who submits a patch fixing it some way before that that's OK too.

I also know about these missing ops that could be fixed:

sm501: rop3 mode with rop 99 is not supported.
sm501: rop3 mode with rop ee is not supported.
