I think this is the direction we should take.

Well, we'll have two.  The normal functions.  And the stubs.

The stubs are inline functions right now, in include/ui/qemu-spice.h, in
the !CONFIG_SPICE section.  We can turn them into normal functions, move
them to some C file.  Let QemuSpiceOpts function pointers point to the
stubs initially.  When spice initializes (no matter whenever modular or
not) it'll set QemuSpiceOpts to the normal implementation.

That way we'll also remove some spice #ifdefs as part of the spice
modularization effort.

Things like the "using_spice" variable which don't depend on the spice
shared libraries can also be moved to the new C file with the spice
stubs.

I don't think we need to hide QemuSpiceOpts with inline functions like
qemu_spice_migrate_info().  I would simply use ...

	struct QemuSpiceOps {
		[ ... ]
		int (*migrate_info)(...);
		[ ... ]
	} qemu_spice;

... then change the ...

	qemu_spice_migrate_info(...)

.. callsites into ...

	qemu_spice.migrate_info(...)

Hmm?  Not sure what you mean.  There is no need for QOM here (and I
can't see anything like that in your spice-vtable branch either).

IMHO it isn't too much overhead, and I find the code is more readable
that way.

See above, I don't think we need wrappers.

take care,
  Gerd
