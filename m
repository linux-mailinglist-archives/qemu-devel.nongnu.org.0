Oh. Yeah, short reads with O_DIRECT are possible (short writes not so
much; for those, you have to write a full buffer then ftruncate back
down). But we DO want to support short reads because of pre-existing
images, whether or not we also improve qcow2 to always create aligned
image sizes. The qcow2 spec allows unaligned images, even if we quit
creating new ones.

My thoughts:

Right now, only io.c sets (or even reads) BDRV_BLOCK_EOF, and it is
documented as an internal flag for optimizations.  But it would be very
easy to amend the contract of driver's .bdrv_co_block_status to state
that a driver may set BDRV_BLOCK_EOF at the end of a file, and MUST set
that flag if the end of the file also happens to be unaligned with
respect to the driver's request_alignment. (Most drivers won't need to
care, but file-posix.c under O_DIRECT would have to start caring).  Then
fix io.c to relax the assertion - the result must either be aligned
(current condition) OR the driver must have reported BDRV_BLOCK_EOF (new
condition). At that point, the block layer can take care of rounding out
the block status for the unaligned tail beyond EOF up to the alignment
boundary (similar to the rounding I have proposed in my other patches).
If you don't get to that first, then it looks like I'll have to fold
that in to my v2 patches when I get back to addressing those block
status alignment problems.

Thanks again for testing, and forcing me to think about the issue.
