It=E2=80=99s probably the only thing that actually makes sense.

Yes (or if the environment doesn=E2=80=99t support them); which is why I
suggested using blockdev-backup.  (But that would have the same problem
of =E2=80=9CWhere does the permission conflict even come from and is it
inevitable?=E2=80=9D)

But it doesn=E2=80=99t really work.  There=E2=80=99s an obscure contract =
that already
binds block-copy to backup-top.

Yes, that=E2=80=99s the contract.  And it=E2=80=99s weird, because block-=
copy has its
own BB, so if it doesn=E2=80=99t want anyone to write to the source outsi=
de of
its control, it should just unshare the WRITE permission =E2=80=93 but it=
 cannot
do that, because its user needs WRITE access, and so it implicitly
relies on that user to then unshare WRITE.

If both used the same single BdrvChild, it would be clear

(1) why the BdrvChild belongs to block-copy=E2=80=99s user (because block=
-copy=E2=80=99s
user would need to own a node that then has this BdrvChild),

(2) why block-copy does not unshare the WRITE permission (it cannot,
because it doesn=E2=80=99t create the BdrvChild),

(3) how block-copy could explicitly ensure that WRITE is unshared (by
asserting !(child->shared_perm & WRITE)).


I=E2=80=99m not saying that we need to abandon having BBs right now, but =
I think
there are a couple of cases which show why I say it=E2=80=99s uglier than=
 using
BdrvChildren instead.
