I support backwards migration; but that migration wouldn't work anyway -
wouldn't that fail nicely with a mismatched RAMBlock size?

On the firmware you develop that choice is fine; but there's no reason
to force that restriction onto others.

I agree that fw has become the vendor OS, but at this point there's no goin=
g back.
Utilizing a virtual platform allows us to greatly increase the security of =
our code,
could we make this change a Qemu experimental flag, so that fw vendors coul=
d
use it at their own risk?

Well yes, I think we know who we're speaking about here and we're
working on it.

Being able to use QEMU to let vendors debug their platform firmware is a
perfectly reasonable use of QEMU; maybe not of your OVMF build - we
need to keep the restrictions on the two separate.

I would hope that continued use of QEMU would encourage us vendors to contr=
ibute
more toward improving the open source project. As Dave pointed out, in no w=
ay

&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) This is not a trivial change, so qemu-trivial: please ign=
ore.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) The comment has not been updated.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (3) I'm almost certain that *if* we want to change this, it n=
eeds to be<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; turned into a machine type (or some device model) property, f=
or<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; migration compatibility.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; I'm missing what this constant exists for - why is the<br>
&gt; &gt; check there at all Is there something else that lives below this<=
br>
&gt; &gt; address that we have to protect?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yes, some MMIOs that I'm at least aware of are IO_APIC_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=
<br>
&gt; (0xfec00000), TPM_PPI_ADDR_BASE (0xFED45000), APIC_DEFAULT_ADDRESS<br>
&gt; (0xfee00000).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; They are not directly adjacent with pflash; nor should they be.<br>
<br>
Hmm those need explicitly checks adding somewhere against<br>
FLASH_SIZE_LIMIT!<br>
<br>
&gt; On one hand, the current FLASH_SIZE_LIMIT is meant to be sufficient fo=
r<br>
&gt; a long time (&quot;should be enough for anyone&quot;).<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; On the other hand, if we have a really strong reason to increase the<b=
r>
&gt; size limit, the current value is supposed to give us a safety margin, =
so<br>
&gt; that we can satisfy the immediate need at that point *first*, and star=
t<br>
&gt; looking into (likely more intrusive) physical address map changes, to<=
br>
&gt; restore the safety margin.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; My reading of the code is that increasing that constant doesn't c=
hange<br>
&gt; &gt; the guests view at all, as long as the guest was given the same f=
lash<br>
&gt; &gt; files - so if the guests view doesn't change, then why would we t=
ie<br>
&gt; &gt; it to the machine type?<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If you increase the size limit (without tieing it to a machine type),<=
br>
&gt; then, with an upgraded QEMU and the same (old) machine type, you can<b=
r>
&gt; start a guest with a larger-than-earlier (cumulative) flash size. Then=
,<br>
&gt; when you try to migrate this to an old QEMU (but same machine type),<b=
r>
&gt; it's a bad surprise. I understand that backwards migration is not<br>
&gt; universally supported (or expected), but I don't want this problem to<=
br>
&gt; land on my desk *ever*.<br>
<br>
I support backwards migration; but that migration wouldn't work anyway -<br=
>
wouldn't that fail nicely with a mismatched RAMBlock size?<br>
<br>
&gt; Furthermore, un-enumerable / platform-MMIO devices tend to pop up time=
<br>
&gt; after time. TPM_PPI_ADDR_BASE (0xFED45000) is a somewhat recent<br>
&gt; addition, for example. It's not like we're never going to need more<br=
>
&gt; address space up there.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (4) I feel we need much more justification for this change th=
an just<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;our firmware is larger than upstream OVMF&quot;.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; In the upstream 4MB unified OVMF build, there's *plenty* of f=
ree room.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course that's not to say that we're willing to *squander* =
that space<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; -- whenever we include anything new in the upstream OVMF plat=
form(s),<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; there must be a very good reason for it --, just that, given =
the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; upstream OVMF status, the proposed pflash increase in QEMU is=
 staggering.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Considering upstream OVMF and QEMU, it should take *years* to=
 even get<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; close to filling the 4MB unified flash image of OVMF (hint: l=
ink-time<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; optimization, LZMA compression), let alone to exhaust the twi=
ce as large<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (8MB) QEMU allowance.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless you are committed to open source your guest firmware t=
oo (maybe<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; as part of upstream edk2, maybe elsewhere), I seriously doubt=
 we should<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; accommodate this use case in *upstream* QEMU. It complicates =
things<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; (minimally with regard to migration), and currently I don't s=
ee the<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; benefit to the upstream community.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Clearly, for building your firmware image, you must have mini=
mally<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; modified the DSC and FDF files in OVMF too, or created an ent=
irely<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; separate firmware platform -- DSC and FDF both.<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are using your downstream OVMF build as a testbed for =
your<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; proprietary physical platform firmware, that's generally a us=
e case that<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; we're mildly interested in not breaking in upstream OvmfPkg. =
But in<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; order to make me care for real (as an OvmfPkg co-maintainer),=
 you'd need<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to upstream your OVMF platform to edk2 (we already have Xen a=
nd --<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; recently added -- bhyve firmware platforms under OvmfPkg, not=
 just<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; QEMU). You'd also have to offer long-term reviewership and te=
sting for<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that platform in edk2 (like the Xen and bhyve stake-holders d=
o). Then we<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; could consider additional complexity in QEMU for booting that=
 firmware<br>
&gt; &gt;&gt; platform.<br>
&gt; &gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; Our UEFI firmware is pretty sparse;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yes, in part because I strive to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
But that's your choice, on our firmware implementation; that's not a<br>
requirement of QEMU or q35.<br>
<br>
&gt; I fight to keep out<br>
&gt; all cruft that I can (at least by conditionalizing it) so that there i=
s<br>
&gt; room for the stuff that I cannot keep out. (And I always strive to set=
<br>
&gt; expectations that flipping all possible build knobs in OVMF to &quot;o=
n&quot; may<br>
&gt; very well cause an &quot;out of space&quot; error.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - I've made sure that PVSCSI_ENABLE and MPT_SCSI_ENABLE be stand-alone=
<br>
&gt; config knobs. The use case behind them is valid, the drivers are open<=
br>
&gt; source, but the use case is still niche, so they must be easy to keep =
out.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - I've made sure LSI_SCSI_ENABLE is a stand-alone config knob too (and=
<br>
&gt; it even defaults to FALSE). The QEMU device that the driver drives is<=
br>
&gt; obsolete / deprecated.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - If VMBus drivers are ever going to be contributed, they'll need a<br=
>
&gt; config knob.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - Current Xen code in OVMF is supposed to be separated completely to t=
he<br>
&gt; new, dedicated XenPVH platform<br>
&gt; &lt;<a href=3D"https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D2122">=
https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D2122</a>&gt;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - Bhyve support is a separate platform build.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - Capsule updates are not supported by OVMF, and if they will ever be,=
<br>
&gt; they're going to have to be a separate firmware platform. Datacenter<b=
r>
&gt; virtualization has no use for capsule updates.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; - The next big thing I expect to have to keep out of OVMF is Redfish<b=
r>
&gt; &lt;<a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)">=
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfish_(specification)</a>&gt;. Libvirt,<br>
&gt; OpenStack, Cockpit, Kubernetes already handle that area *underneath* t=
he<br>
&gt; guest, I believe. (It's OK to use OVMF for developing / testing Redfis=
h;<br>
&gt; it's not OK to expect that the current OVMF firmware platform contain<=
br>
&gt; everything that it contains now *plus* Redfish.)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Sparse is *good*.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; it doesn't have any pretty graphics<br>
&gt; &gt; or snazzy stuff,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Which is arguably completely superfluous on every possible platform on=
e<br>
&gt; can imagine. On the other hand, if you want a real serial port on<br>
&gt; workstation class hardware, you may have to order a separate part (if<=
br>
&gt; you are lucky and you *can* order one). Serial-over-LAN is a complete<=
br>
&gt; non-replacement.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The reason (should I say: excuse) for the firmware to exist is to (a)<=
br>
&gt; boot operating systems, (b) abstract away some ugly platform-specific<=
br>
&gt; hardware for OS runtime (by providing ACPI and SMBIOS descriptions, an=
d<br>
&gt; a *small* set of runtime services). We can maybe add (c) &quot;root of=
 trust&quot;.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In practice, physical firmware is becoming the hw vendor's OS before<b=
r>
&gt; (and under) your OS, one you cannot replace, and one whose updates can=
<br>
&gt; brick your hardware. Permitting the same feature creep on virtual<br>
&gt; platforms is wrong.<br>
<br>
On the firmware you develop that choice is fine; but there's no reason<br>
to force that restriction onto others.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I agree that fw has become the vendor OS, but at this point there's no=
 going back.</div>
<div>Utilizing a virtual platform allows us to greatly increase the securit=
y of our code,</div>
<div>could we make this change a Qemu experimental flag, so that fw vendors=
 could</div>
<div>use it at their own risk?<br>
</div>
<div><br>
&gt; &gt; or have to survive configuring lots of hardware; also<br>
&gt; &gt; I'm aware of other companies who are looking at putting big blobs=
<br>
&gt; &gt; of stuff in firmware for open uses;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Key term being &quot;open uses&quot;. Let us see them.<br>
<br>
Well yes, I think we know who we're speaking about here and we're<br>
working on it.<br>
<br>
&gt; &gt; so I don't see a problem with<br>
&gt; &gt; changing this limit from the QEMU side of things.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I do. Software and data always expand to consume all available space,<=
br>
&gt; and it's going to cause a conflict between UEFI features and platform<=
br>
&gt; MMIO sooner or later. Then I'll get the privilege of shuffling around<=
br>
&gt; the crap in OVMF (all of which is &quot;indispensable&quot; or course)=
.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; If we ever go down this route, it needs to benefit open source directl=
y<br>
&gt; and significantly.<br>
<br>
Being able to use QEMU to let vendors debug their platform firmware is a<br=
>
perfectly reasonable use of QEMU; maybe not of your OVMF build - we<br>
need to keep the restrictions on the two separate.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I would hope that continued use of QEMU would encourage us vendors to =
contribute<br>
</div>
<div>more toward improving the open source project. As Dave pointed out, in=
 no way</div>
<div>would anyone be forced (or able) to use vendor fw binaries unless we s=
tarted to</div>
