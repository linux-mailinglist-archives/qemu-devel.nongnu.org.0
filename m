It's surprising me a bit...  IMHO if we allow the bus number to change
then at least many scripts can even fail which might work before.
E.g. , a very common script can run "lspci-like" program to list each
device and then do "lspci-like -vvv" again upon the BDF it fetched
from previous commands.  Any kind of BDF caching would be invalid
since that from either userspace or kernel.

Also, obviously the data to be stored in IVRS is closely bound to how
bus number is defined.  Even if we can add a new linker-loader command
to all the open firmwares like seabios or OVMF but still we can't do
that to Windows (or, could we?...).

Now one step back, I'm also curious on the reason behind on why AMD
spec required the IVRS with BDF information, rather than the scope
information like what Intel DMAR spec was asking for.

Thanks,
