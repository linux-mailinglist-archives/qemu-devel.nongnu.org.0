To be clear, I'm not recommending we wait that long - I'm just
suggesting that is an upper bound after which we'd really need
to wait for the dev cycle after.

Ideally we would make a strong push to get it merged just 2 weeks
after this release, ie by early september.

All depends how quickly Paolo thinks it get to mergeable state....
