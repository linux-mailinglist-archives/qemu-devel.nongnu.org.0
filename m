With that confirmed I checked if I can just point to a bios to break it, an=
d indeed adding =

  -bios /root/seabios_1.12.0-1/usr/share/seabios/bios.bin
  -bios /root/seabios_1.13.0-1/usr/share/seabios/bios.bin
respectively is a make or break change.


As a next step I reproduced the error with seabios rel-1.13.0 from https://=
review.coreboot.org/seabios.git.
It crashes as well.

But to make this puzzle even more interesting rel-1.12.0 from the same git =
crashes as well.
I wonder where this trip might end, from qemu to seabios to ... compiler?

  As outlined here:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1813165/comments/15

  After upgrade, all KVM guests are in a default pause state. Even after
  forcing them off via virsh, and restarting them the guests are paused.

  These Guests are not nested.

  A lot of diganostic information are outlined in the previous bug
  report link provided. The solution mentioned in previous report had
  been allegedly integrated into the downstream updates.
