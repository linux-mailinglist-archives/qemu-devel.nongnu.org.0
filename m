I'm wondering if we should split this doc in two parts. The first 50%
of it is actually relevant to both QEMU developers and downstream QEMU
developers of mgmt apps and/or end users.

The latter half is purely of interest to QEMU developers.

Break here.

Everything above here is useful to QEMU devs, app devs & end users and
should be made part of the main QEMU doc - convert it to texi and @include
it from qemu-doc.texi, as we do for other stuff under docs/

Everything below here could just be renamed to "secure-coding-practices.rst"
and solely target qemu devs.
