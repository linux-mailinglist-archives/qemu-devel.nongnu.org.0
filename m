It ugly the code with a lot of "if"s for maintaining compatibility for 
guests that somehow relies on interface being broken and unusable.
Can do this but am wondering if it's worth it.

Well... Both implemented commands (CMD_GETVERSION and CMD_GETRRAMSIZE) 
fails to return their proper value.
CMD_GETVERSION will always return VMPORT_MAGIC that happened to be in 
EAX previously (i.e. return 0x564D5868 instead of 6).
CMD_GETRAMSIZE will always return VMPORT_MAGIC that happened to be in 
EAX previously (i.e. return 0x564D5868 instead of VM RAM size).

If guest somehow relied on this, it is already quite broken...
My belief is that all upstream QEMU users today relies on VMPort only 
for the sake of a functioning VMMouse which is indeed not broken because 
vmmouse_set_data() explicitly override EAX.

Blocking migration for old machine-types is a "no go" in my opinion as 
vmport is enabled by default. It will cause too many VMs to need be able 
to backwards migrate.

So it's either doing nothing (as patch-series is now) or adding a flag 
that adds a bunch of ugly "ifs" and is tied to a machine-type.
