Consider the following scenario: a management application such as
libvirt starts a long-running task with the intent to monitor it until
it finishes.  Half-way through, the management application needs to
disconnect and reconnect for some reason (systemctl restart, or crash &
recover, or whatever).

If the long-running task is a job, the management application can resume
after reconnect: the job's ID is as valid as it was before, and the
commands to query and control the job work as before.

What if it's and asynchronous command?

Making a synchronous command asynchronous definitely changes API.

You could still argue the change is easier to handle for QMP clients
than a replacement by a job.
