I would think the efficiency of this would be horrible.

I should have chimed in sooner.

The i.MX i2c device has ACPI and OF support, I believe, and it's already
available in qemu.  I don't think the Intel smbus device would work.

The designware one is a pretty common and general one, it's a little
suprising that it hasn't already been done on qemu.  I would be ok with
this but Peter has the big picture here.
