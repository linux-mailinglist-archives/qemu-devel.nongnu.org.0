As written, "pattern":"allocate-top" is rather limited - it can only 
grab allocation from the top node.  Being able to grab the allocation 
from a specific node may indeed be more useful.  Another bitmap patterns 
that might be useful would be an all-one pattern (create a bitmap that 
treats the entire disk as dirty).  I also remember brainstorming with 
John the question of whether we want bitmap-populate to have different 
mask modes: does the population perform an overwrite (the bitmap now 
matches the source pattern exactly, even if some bits were set and 
others cleared), a union merge (any bits already set in the bitmap 
remain set, additional bits are set according to pattern), or even a 
difference (any bits already cleared in the bitmap remain clear, while 
bits in the pattern can also clear additional bits in the bitmap).

If I understand Peter's goals, the initial libvirt use is a union mode 
(keep bits in the bitmap that are already set, but set additional bits 
according to the population pattern).

But when it comes to multiple destinations or multiple sources, while it 
seems like it might be a convenience factor, I also worry that it is 
over-engineering.  See more below...

Hmm, I left out the mandatory "job-id" parameter here; one of the key 
points of the new command is that some patterns (like allocation) may 
involve potentially lengthy I/O, so we need a job-id (the existing 
block-dirty-bitmap-merge does not).  But since the existing 
block-dirty-bitmap-merge supports multiple sources to one destination, 
supporting multiple patterns to one destination tracked by a single job 
id does have some appeal.

We already have transactions that let us perform multiple destinations 
as a group.  So what is the difference in the end results between 
merging one source into two separate destinations in one command spelled 
this way:

# proposal with many:many bitmap populate
{ "execute": "block-dirty-bitmap-populate",
   "arguments": { "job-id": "job0",
                  "targets": [ { "node": "base", "name": "b1" },
                               { "node": "base", "name": "b2" } ],
                  "source": { "pattern": "allocation", "node": "top" } } }
wait for job to complete

vs. spelled this way:

# patch as written with 1:1 bitmap-populate, but tweak to source
{ "execute": "block-dirty-bitmap-add",
   "arguments": { "node": "top", "name": "tmp" } }
{ "execute": "block-dirty-bitmap-populate",
   "arguments": { "job-id": "job0",
                  "node": "top", "name": "tmp",
                  "source": { "pattern": "allocation", "node": "top" } } }
wait for job to complete
{ "execute": "transaction",
   "arguments": { "actions": [
     { "type": "block-dirty-bitmap-merge", "node": "base", "name": "b1",
         "bitmaps": [ { "node": "top", "name": "tmp" } ] },
     { "type": "block-dirty-bitmap-merge", "node": "base", "name": "b2",
         "bitmaps": [ { "node": "top", "name": "tmp" } ] }
] } }

I guess I'm struggling in posting a v4 in part because I don't have a 
good answer to what is easiest for Peter to use.
