This is clear to me. The move of the code there is simply to:

1) make sure that, for non-host, versioned cpu models, we continue to set the kvm_default_props and apply them in the same way.

2) for the host cpu, make sure that kvm_enable_x2apic() is called. x86_cpu_change_kvm_default is completely irrelevant for host cpu, as you have noted.

You are right that we continue to not handle the error path correctly on kvm_enable_x2apic failure, for both smp > 255 and <= 255.

I tend to agree that what we want if kvm_enable_x2apic fails is to abort QEMU if we have been requesting smp > 255,
and if we did not request smp > 255 cpus, we want to not advertise the feature.

This is not accomplished, neither by my snippet above, not by the existing code at any point in git history, and not by yours in itself.

Your change seems to accomplish the call to kvm_enable_x2apic, and abort if requested smp > 255,
but it does not stop advertising X2APIC and ext-dest-id on kvm_enable_x2apic failure for the case < 255, so we'd need to add that.

Do I understand it right? Do we need to wrap all of this logic in a if (kvm_enabled()) ?

right, it makes absolutely no difference, and we cannot use kvm_default_props, as they are for something else entirely.

right, we need to change it by other means.

It is still unclear to me for which cpu classes and versioned models we should behave like this. Thoughts?

"max"? "base"? versioned models: depending on the model features?

Understand. We also need though:

3. Not call kvm_enable_x2apic() when it should not be called (non-KVM accelerator, which cpu classes and models)
4. Not stop advertising X2APIC and ext-dest-id when we shouldn't stop advertising it.

see comments above, and should we limit that code to when kvm is enabled?

I think it is good to abort early if we figure out that the user request of APIC ID >= 255 cannot be satisfied.

Well the harm in my mind is, do we need to handle the error condition correctly at each single place? 
Do we risk slightly different behavior and advertised features depending on where the call happens?

Seems that we can reduce the complexity and long term risk by handling things in one single place, if we definitely find what that place should be.

Thanks,
