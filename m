Done, sir O:-)

For the WIP part, it was easier to have the bits that didn't change and
the ones that I was working with.

Fixed.

it is going to end:

   if (migrate_use_multifd_zlib()) {
       multifd_send_state->ops = &multifd_zlib_ops;
   if (migrate_use_multifd_zstd()) {
       multifd_send_state->ops = &multifd_zstd_ops;
   } else {
       multifd_send_state->ops = &multifd_none_ops;
   }

We can use:

multifd_send_state->ops = multifd_ops[migrate_multifd_method(void)];

About what is easier to read .....  it depends on taste.

Will change anyways.

Thanks, Juan.
