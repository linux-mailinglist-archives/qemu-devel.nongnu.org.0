I'd love to keep the v5 series and address Markus issues, but as shown
by the quantity of respins, I don't understand the migration feature
enough to fix it in time for the next release. I plan to address them
(and other issues reported by Markus in other reviews) during the next
dev cycle.

Since it is very late in the release process and this series intend to
fix a guest corruption bug worthwhile for release, the approch taken by
v6 is "try to change the strict minimum regarding to migration, do not
worry about spec issues". I even tried to make no migration change at
all, but as explained in patch 6 "Extract pflash_mode_read_array" there
is still one.

I could make no migration change, and in patch 6 not call
memory_region_rom_device_set_romd() in pflash_mode_read_array() [and
call it in other places instead], but then we still have the undefined
behavior described in the patch. We always lived with this UNDEF, so...
I could work on a simpler v7.

To reassure you, it never worked well but nobody cared, I noticed while
converting DPRINTF to trace-events and adding more, then follow the
model state machine. While it's probably not worth fixing, it makes
debugging slighly harder when looking at the CFI spec workflow. Now I'm
used to it.

I tried to be verbose in the patch description, so for reference:

0xff on v5:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-07/msg03368.html

not 0xff on v6:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-07/msg03931.html

migration impact on v6 [1]:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-07/msg03932.html

> (2) Has someone regression-tested v6 for migration specifically?

No, neither were tested the previous versions.

v6 should be way less risky than previous versions (still one issue
noted in [1]).

> (3) I'm fine regression testing v6 too (without migration, again).

Yes, I know your testing takes very long, so let's wait first.

Thanks for having a look.
