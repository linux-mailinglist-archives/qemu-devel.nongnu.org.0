I think there's room to extend and rework lcitool so that it can be
used for QEMU CI as well, and we should definitely look into that.

Right now it only really covers VMs and containers, but there's
already one situation (FreeBSD) where the expectation is that you'd
import an existing VM image and then apply CI-related customizations
on top, so it's not too much of a stretch to imagine doing the same
for a bare metal machine. We use Ansible, so as long as we can
connect to the machine via ssh we're pretty much good to go.

Installation of VMs we already perform in an unattended fashion using
preseed/kickstart, and it should be relatively straighforward to
adapt those configurations to also work on real hardware. This way
we'd both be able to rely on having a sane OS as the base, and
relieve the administrator from the duty of manually installing the
machines.
