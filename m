Thanks Michael for this information!
If you don't mind I'll amend it to the commit description so there is a
reference for posterity.

I'm waiting for *Andreas Gustafsson to test it then will repost.*

Title:
  qemu can no longer boot NetBSD/sparc

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  Booting NetBSD/sparc in qemu no longer works.  It broke between qemu
  version 5.0.0 and 5.1.0, and a bisection identified the following as
  the offending commit:

    [5d971f9e672507210e77d020d89e0e89165c8fc9] memory: Revert "memory:
  accept mismatching sizes in memory_region_access_valid"

  It's still broken as of 7fd51e68c34fcefdb4d6fd646ed3346f780f89f4.

  To reproduce, run

    wget http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-9.0/images/NetBSD-9.0-spar=
c.iso
    qemu-system-sparc -nographic -cdrom NetBSD-9.0-sparc.iso -boot d

  The expected behavior is that the guest boots to the prompt

    Installation medium to load the additional utilities from:

  The observed behavior is a panic:

    [   1.0000050] system[0]: trap 0x29: pc=3D0xf0046b14 sfsr=3D0xb6 sfva=
=3D0x54000000
    [   1.0000050] cpu0: data fault: pc=3D0xf0046b14 addr=3D0x54000000 sfsr=
=3D0xb6<PERR=3D0x0,LVL=3D0x0,AT=3D0x5,FT=3D0x5,FAV,OW>
    [   1.0000050] panic: kernel fault
    [   1.0000050] halted
