When starting an L2 KVM guest with `ic-mode=3Ddual,kernel-irqchip=3Don`,
QEMU fails with:

KVM is too old to support ic-mode=3Ddual,kernel-irqchip=3Don

This error message was introduced to detect older KVM versions that
didn't allow destruction and re-creation of the XICS KVM device that
we do at reboot. But it is actually the same issue that we get with
nested guests : when running under pseries, KVM currently provides
a genuine XICS device (not the XICS-on-XIVE device that we get
under powernv) which doesn't support destruction/re-creation.

This will eventually be fixed in KVM but in the meantime, update
the error message and documentation to mention the nested case.
While here, mention that in "No XIVE support in KVM" section that
this can also happen with "guest OSes supporting XIVE" since
we check this at init time before starting the guest.
