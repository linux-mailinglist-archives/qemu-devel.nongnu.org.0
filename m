[Thanks for copying Richard Henderson]

Yes, the functionality is only supported on aarch64 currently by intention
because the next patch enables it on "max" and "host" CPU models and both
of them are running in aarch64 mode.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11366119/

If you really want to get this supported for aarch32 either, I can do
it. However, it seems there is a long list of aarch32 CPU models, defined
in target/arm/cpu.c::arm_cpus. so which CPU models you prefer to see with
this supported? I think we might choose one or two popular CPU models if
you agree.

Thanks,
Gavin
