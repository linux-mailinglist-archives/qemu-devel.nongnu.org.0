Hi Richard，

Sorry to reply so late.

Upstream is really difficult . I was really frustrated to recieve so 
many difficult comments.

It is hard for me to absorb them and will take a lot of time to fixup. 
Now I will move on.

Use vreg[].element[] is my gut feeling.  It will be easiest to 
understand the code.

As you said, view all vector registers as a single block of memory is 
good for programing.

I'm sorry that it's really hard to absorb your opinion. I don't know why 
clang will fail

when index beyond the end of vreg[n] into vreg[n+1].

As Chih-Min Chao said in another part of PATCH V2 thread,  VLEN will be 
a property which can be

specified from command line.  So the sub-struct maybe defined as

struct {
     union{
         uint64_t *u64 ;
         int64_t  *s64;
         uint32_t *u32;
         int32_t  *s32;
         uint16_t *u16;
         int16_t  *s16;
         uint8_t  *u8;
         int8_t   *s8;
     } mem;
     target_ulong vxrm;
     target_ulong vxsat;
     target_ulong vl;
     target_ulong vstart;
     target_ulong vtype;
} vext;

Will that be OK?

All check code will be moved from execution time to translation.

The (ill, lmul, sew ) of vtype  will be placed within tb_flags, also the 
bit of (VSTART == 0 && VL == VLMAX).

So it will take 8 bits of tb flags for vector extension at least.

It's quiker to use generic vector of TCG.

However, I have one problem to support both command line VLEN and vreg_ofs.

As in SVE,  vreg ofs is the offset from cpu_env. If the structure of 
vector extension (to support command line VLEN） is

struct {
     union{
         uint64_t *u64 ;
         int64_t  *s64;
         uint32_t *u32;
         int32_t  *s32;
         uint16_t *u16;
         int16_t  *s16;
         uint8_t  *u8;
         int8_t   *s8;
     } mem;
     target_ulong vxrm;
     target_ulong vxsat;
     target_ulong vl;
     target_ulong vstart;
     target_ulong vtype;
} vext

I can't find the way to get the direct offset of vreg from cpu_env.

Maybe I should specify a max VLEN like the way of SVE?
