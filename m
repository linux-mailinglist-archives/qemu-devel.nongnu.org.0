I wonder if we're not forgetting about the main reason we ended up
with all this chaos - the host-allocated buffers. ;)

Do we really have an issue with sharing guest memory between different
virtio devices? Each of those devices could just accept a scatterlist
of guest pages and import that memory to whatever host component it's
backed by.

The case that really needs some support from VIRTIO is when the
buffers are allocated in the host. Sharing buffers from virtio-gpu
with a virtio video decoder or Wayland (be it a dedicated virtio
device or vsock) are some of the examples.

Best regards,
Tomasz
