Update: compiling qemu upstream & using the latest version didn't change
anything.


I don't know if this is an instance of user emulation limitations due to mi=
ssing syscalls.

Title:
  qemu-aarch64 hangs on cptofs during a build of NixOS SD card image

Status in QEMU:
  New

Bug description:
  First, thank you for this incredible project.

  While following this guide to build my own image of NixOS:
  https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_on_ARM#Compiling_through_QEMU on ARM
  Aarch64.

  I encountered a very strange behavior, qemu is correctly used and
  build most of the binaries until it executes this exact line over
  qemu: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/lib/make-
  ext4-fs.nix#L55

  At this step, the qemu process goes to 100 % of CPU, hangs in a
  certain syscall I don't know which one (according to strace & gdb
  which has no symbols so breaking and looking the backtrace was
  useless).

  According to iotop, no I/O was done.

  And it spent all its time in this syscall during more than 10 hours,
  which looks anomalous to me.

  I attach some of my CPU info:

  model		: 142
  model name	: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz
  stepping	: 10
  microcode	: 0x96
  cpu MHz		: 3107.071
  cache size	: 8192 KB

  I'm using a ThinkPad T480 to perform those builds, I'm uncertain of
  how to debug further this issue, I discussed this with some people
  over #nixos-aarch64 and they told me they didn't know how to debug it
  further too.

  I tried all with this package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages
  /qemu-arm-static/ =E2=80=94=C2=A0I'm currently compiling qemu-git to see =
if it
  happens on upstream too. Will comment when it's done.

  Thank you in advance!
