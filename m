Thank you for the reminder Alex!

I grabbed all patches in master which are tagged for stable (had to
tweak two nvme patches) and another which was pending in pm215 pullreq
(target-arm-Fix-physical-address-resolution-for-Stage2), and uploaded
7.2-2 to debian unstable. bpo11 version is ready too, I'll upload it
once 7.2-2 is built on unstable, hopefully there's no further regressions
in the changes I picked.
