SEV already registers that callback - sev_machine_done_notify, which
calls sev_launch_get_measure.  We want the hashes page filled and
encrypted *before* that measurement is taken by the PSP.  We can squeeze
in the hashes and page encryption before the measurement *if* we can
calculate the hashes at this point.

x86_load_linux already deals with kernel/initrd/cmdline, so that was the
easiest place to add the hash calculation.

It's also a bit weird (semantically) to modify the guest RAM after
pc_memory_init has finished.


We can add a new notifier towards the end of x86_load_linux, but can we
avoid passing all the different pointers+sizes of kernel/initrd/cmdline
to that notifier?  Do you envision other uses for registering on that event?
