am a little worried that we forgot the primary reasons/scenarios why want
it in the first place. In that light, may I ask you to recheck this latest
version of the patch, v16, against your scenarios (you mentioned earlier
you have two significantly different flavors of your scenario, one with
Ubuntu 16, and another with Ubuntu 19)?

Thanks a bunch, Jim! Laurent, based on all the info, it looks to me v16 is
the way to go. Aleksandar R. can test his nanoMips scenarios later on,
since nanoMips user mode is not integrated yet anyway, but I hope
everything is fine there too.

Thanks again to all involved!
