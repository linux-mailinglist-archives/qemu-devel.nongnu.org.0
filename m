I don't think rST is an improvement over Texinfo.  As Paolo said, it's
the Perl of ASCII-based markups.  But I (reluctantly) agree with Paolo
that our current mix of Texinfo, rST, Markdown, and ad hoc markup is
worse than consistent use of one markup system, even if it's an
ill-conceived one like rST.

March of progress, I guess.
