Hello Niek and Philippe,

Thank you very much for your support and all the information provided,
I will create a new "roadmap" with all this excellent information and try
again.

Thank you again and best regards,

&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Hello!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Some months ago I started to work trying to port th=
e Beaglebone<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0support from the old qemu-linaro fork to the new QE=
MU mainstream.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0During my work I found that the Beaglebone have an =
OMAP3 mpu this<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0mpu has very strong relation with the OMAP2 and OMA=
P1 in qemu, they<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0implement a lot of functions in common.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Then I understood that the omap1 and omap2 don&#39;=
t implement things<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0like QOM and needs a lot of work to upgrade it, at =
the same time<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0they are some boards like: omap1_sx, palm, nseries =
that implement<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0this mpus.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Looking the datasheet of the omap1 I realized that =
it&#39;s an very old<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0device and some questions like &quot;make sense wor=
k with this old<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0device?&quot; comes to my mind.<br>
<br>
The OMAP3 reuse various components of the OMAP1/2.<br>
Although in old shape, the OMAP1/2 are in the codebase and work.<br>
It make sense to me to start upgrading the OMAP1/2 to new QOM standard, <br=

That is:<br>
<br>
- Add tests using old code (booting Linux, network access in guest)<br>
- Add an empty board<br>
- Plug an empty OMAP SoC into the board, add the PoP LPDRAM<br>
- Add a ARM926 core into the SoC<br>

- Add the interrupt controller in the SoC<br>
