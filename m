Actually that's a simplification, it depends on a few things.  When 
mixeng is off, qemu will try to use the same format as the emulated 
sound card, and if the backend doesn't support that format, it won't 
work (no audio).  Also attaching multiple sound cards to the same 
audiodev might not work, if the backend doesn't support multiple 
playback streams.  If you use pulseaudio, it'll work without problems, 
if you use alsa, it depends on your device.  If you use a hw: device 
directly, you'll likely only be able to use one emulated sound card with 
a few selected audio formats.  If you use dmix: (and plug), alsa will 
handle the conversion and mixing, so it will work no matter what format 
the emulated sound card uses.  With OSS the situation is probably 
similar, it depends on the kernel/hw what works and what not.  wav and 
spice certainly doesn't support multiple streams.  I'm not completely 
sure about the other backends right now, but I think dsound and 
coreaudio can handle the necessary sample format conversions and mixing.

See above.
