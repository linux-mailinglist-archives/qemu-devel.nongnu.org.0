I'm not sure what will be the next patch after all the changes we were 
talking about but don't put too many changes in one patch. It may worth 
keeping this as a separate change even if it's simple and only affecting 
piix4 now just to make it clear and simpler to review and maybe bisect 
later. Generally one change per patch is preferred even if it results in a 
lot of small patches (unless maybe combining a small style fix or very 
simple one line change with another simple patch that may not worth a 
separate patch). This may be over that limit so better to keep as separate 
patch but again not sure what patch you meant to combine it with but the 
patch submission guidelines say separate changes should be separate 
patches.
