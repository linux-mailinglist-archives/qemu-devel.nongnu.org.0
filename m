Public bug reported:

Guest: Windows 7 x64
Host: Ubuntu 18.04.4 (kernel 5.3.0-40-generic)
QEMU: master 6c599282f8ab382fe59f03a6cae755b89561a7b3

If I try to use GDB to repeatedly single-step a userspace process while
running a KVM guest, the userspace process will eventually crash with a
0x80000004 exception (single step). This is easily reproducible on a
Windows guest, I've not tried another guest type but I've been told it's
the same there also.

On a Ubuntu 16 host with an older kernel, this will hang the entire
machine. However, it seems it may have been fixed by
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?=
id=3D5cc244a20b86090c087073c124284381cdf47234
?

It's not clear to me whether this is a KVM or a QEMU bug. A TCG guest
does not crash the userspace process in the same way, but it does hang
the VM.

I've tried a variety of QEMU versions (3.0, 4.2, master) and they all
exhibit the same behavior. I'm happy to dig into this more if someone
can point me in the right direction.

Here's the outline for reproducing the bug:

* Compile iloop.cpp (attached) as a 32-bit application using MSVC
* Start Windows 7 x64 guest under GDB
  * Pass '-enable-kvm -smp 4,cores=3D2 -gdb tcp::4567' to QEMU along with o=
ther typical options

(need to get CR3 to ensure we're in the right application context -- if the=
re's an easier way to do this I'd love to hear it!)
* Install WinDBG on guest
* Copy SysInternals LiveKD to guest
* Start iloop.exe in guest, note loop address
* Run LiveKD from administrative prompt
  * livekd64.exe -w
* In WinDBG:
  * !process 0 0
  * Search for iloop.exe, note DirBase (this is CR3)

In GDB:
* Execute 'target remote tcp::4567'
* Execute 'c'
* Hit CTRL-C to pause the VM
* Execute 'p/x $cr3'
  .. continue if not equal to DirBase in WinDBG, keep stopping until it is =
equal
* Once $cr3 is correct value, if you 'stepi' a few times you'll note the pr=
ocess going in a loop, it should keep hitting the address echoed to the con=
sole by iloop.exe

Crash the process from GDB:
* Execute 'stepi 100000000'
* Watch the process, eventually it'll die with an 0x80000004 error
