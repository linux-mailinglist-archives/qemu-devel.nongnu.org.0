Bit of a hack, but still better than what we have now.  If you post
that for dtc upstream <devicetree-compiler@vger.kernel.org>, I'd apply
it.

Another improvement would be to not include these files on a "make
clean" - it's kind of annoying how a make clean will regenerate all
these before removing them.
