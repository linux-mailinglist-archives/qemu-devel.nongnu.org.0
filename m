I also believe that having jobs that can be reproducible is key, but I
differ when it comes to believing that the hardware *alone* should
define if a job is gating or not.

My point is that even with easily accessible systems and software,
different jobs can easily yield different results, because of how the
underlying system is configured.  Sure, containers, but again, we have
to consider non container usage too.

In the RFC I tried to gather feedback on a plan to promote and demote
jobs from a gating status.  IMO, most jobs would begin their lives
being non-gating, and would prove both their stability and their
mantainer's responsiveness.  Even when such jobs are already gating,
it should be trivial to simply demote a gating job because of (and
not limited to) any of the following reasons:

 * job fails in a non-reproducible way
 * hardware is unresponsive and takes too long to produce results
 * maintainer is MIA

Some or all of the gating runners could also pick up jobs sent to
a branch other than "staging", say, a branch called "reproducer". That
branch could be writable by maintainers that need to reproduce a given
failure.

One of the goals of the patches you'll find on this series is to
propose (I would say *require*) that new jobs that require new hardware
(even easily accessible systems such as x86) should provide easy to run
scripts to recreate those environments.  This is inline with my previous
point that it's not enough to just have the same hardware.

>=20

Other people may be more familiar with this, but I do remember projects
such as OpenStack deferring test of hardware/software combinations to
other entities.  One specific party won't be able to
reproduce all configurations unless it's decided to be kept really
small.  In my opinion, it's better to face it and acknowledge that
fact, and have plans to be put to action in the exceptional cases where
the environment to reproduce a test is now unavailable.

>=20

Well, I have the feeling that some people maintaining those runners
will *not* want to have them as "informational" only.  If they invest a
good amount of time on them, I believe they'll want to reap the
benefits such as other not breaking the code they rely on.  If their
system is not gating, they lose that and may find breakage that CI did
not catch.  Again, I don't think "easily accessible" hardware should be
the only criteria for gating/non-gating status.

For instance, would you consider, say, a "Raspberry Pi 4 Model
B", running KVM jobs to be a reproducible runner?  Would you blame a
developer that breaks a Gating CI job on such a platform and says that
he can not reproduce it?

>=20

I do think that the owner of such runners may *not* want to have them
with Gating jobs, but I don't think the opposite should be the case,
because I find it very hard to define, without some prejudice, what
"easily available runner" means.

>=20

That's where I'm trying to help.  I built and tested the gitlab-runner
for a number of non-supported environments, and I expect to build
further on that (say contributing code or feedback back to GitLab so
they become official builds?).
