I merged this to our internal tree and run some of our tests,
unfortunately it causes quite a few regressions. I'll try to
get you details as I go and respond to individual patches if
related otherwise here.

So a first general regression is that opcode 0 no longer
traps as an illegal instruction (seems to be treated as an
add with all r0).

Cheers,
Edgar
